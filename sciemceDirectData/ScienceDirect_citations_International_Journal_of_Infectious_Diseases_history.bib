abstract = "Design
We conducted a prospective, multicenter study to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the GeneXpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra), and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) assay for tuberculous meningitis (TBM) in China.
Methods
A prospective cohort study was conducted among individuals with symptoms suggestive of TBM registered in three TB specialised hospitals in China between between June 2018 and January 2019.
Results
Overall, 84 patients suggestive of TBM were included in our analysis between June 2018 and January 2019. Using microbiological evidence as reference, the sensitivity/specificity for the diagnostic tests were Xpert Ultra 93.3%/100%; cfDNA 93.3%/92.6%; and culture 13.3%/100%. In addition, the sensitivity of culture was 6.7% when using clinical diagnosis criteria as gold standard. Xpert Ultra correctly identified 28 cases as TBM, indicating a sensitivity of 46.7%. Notably, four additional TBM cases were detected by cfDNA compared with Xpert Ultra, yielding an overall sensitivity of 53.3%. Statistical analysis revealed that the sensitivity of Xpert Ultra and cfDNA were significantly higher than that of culture.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our data demonstrate that Xpert Ultra and cfDNA assay show optimal sensitivity compared with MGIT culture. In addition, there is no significant correlation between bacterial load and TBM severity in our participants."

Till date, the most commonly used method for the identification and confirmation of the virus is the laboratory-based reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Unfortunately, testing capacities have been limited in many parts of Africa because of inadequate test kits which have restricted scaling up beyond the few public health laboratories at designated locations. We present in this mini-review Africa’s preparedness and readiness toward testing, why testing is crucial, the need to immediately strengthen existing facilities and what it involves as combined approaches for managing the COVID-19 crisis. The review highlights the urgent need for speedy expansion and distribution of several laboratory testing platforms to public health facilities and fully accredited private clinical laboratories, including real-time PCR and serological assays."

A priority-setting process (PSP) was launched to define priorities for patient-centered antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance and research in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). A list of uncertainties related to AMR surveillance in human health was generated using an online survey of stakeholders in LMICs, which asked for unanswered questions about diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of antibiotic resistance.
Results
A total of 445 respondents generated 1076 questions that were mapped to a final shortlist of 107 questions. The most common theme was the treatment of drug-resistant infections, followed by diagnosis, then prevention, and requests for local AMR data. The most asked question was a request for local AMR data, revealing the lack of basic information in many LMICs to guide actions to tackle AMR. The steering group recommended three research areas to be prioritized for funding in the next five years: infection prevention and control in LMICs, improved electronic patient records, starting with laboratory information management systems, and sustainable behavior change among doctors and other health care professionals with a focus on diagnostic stewardship."

abstract = "Background
Limited data are available on the incidence and factors associated with viral rebound following viral suppression among HIV-infected individuals taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Kenya. Furthermore, the durability of viral suppression among HIV individuals taking ART is unknown. Information on incidence rates and factors associated with HIV viral load rebound and the durability of viral suppression (undetectable HIV copies in plasma) among HIV-infected individuals taking ART, will help improve the long-term management of HIV-infected individuals and explore approaches to long-term HIV remission or complete cure.
Objectives
The objectives of this study were to investigate the incidence rates of viral rebound following viral suppression, factors associated with viral rebound, and the durability of viral suppression among HIV-infected individuals on ART from Kilifi, Meru, and Nakuru counties in Kenya.
Methods
This was a retrospective study involving 600 HIV-infected individuals taking combination ART (cART) and enrolled in comprehensive care centers (CCCs) at Malindi Sub-county Hospital, Nakuru Level 5 Hospital, and Meru Level 5 Hospital in Kenya. The medical files were inspected and medical history records abstracted for the selected participants. Participant laboratory data including HIV viral loads, types and history of ART, and treatment history of any opportunistic infections were abstracted using an abstraction checklist. Participants were grouped into those who achieved HIV viral suppression, with viral loads lower than the detection limit (LDL) (viral suppression), and those who experienced one or more detectable viral load measurements >40 copies/ml following the initial LDL (viral rebound). Durable viral suppression was defined as all viral load values at LDL over the 2-year period (2017–2019). Univariate and multivariate Poisson regression analyses were performed to assess the rates of viral rebound, as well as to investigate factors associated with it.
Results
Out of 549 HIV-positive patients, 324/549 (59%) achieved HIV viral suppression (Meru 159/194 (82%), Nakuru 21/178 (12%), and Malindi 144/177 (81%)). The overall viral rebound rate was 41%, with site-specific viral rebound of 88.2%, 18.6%, and 18.0% in Nakuru, Malindi, and Meru, respectively. There was an overall rate of first viral rebound of 3.9 (95% confidence interval (CI) 6.9–14.4), 0.7 (95% CI 0.5–1.0), and 0.89 (95% CI 0.64–1.24) per 100 person-months in Nakuru, Malindi, and Meru, respectively. Good ART adherence (p = 0.0002), widow status (p = 0.0062), and World Health Organization (WHO) stage I (p = 0.0002) were associated with viral suppression, while poor ART adherence (p < 0.0001), WHO stage II (p = 0.0024), and duration on ART of 36 months (p = 0.0350) were associated with viral rebound.
Conclusions
The rate of viral suppression in patients on cART in the CCCs fell short of the WHO target. However, the study provides proof of evidence of undetectable viral load levels for more than 2 years, a sign that the United Nation’s 2030 objective of controlling the risk of HIV transmission could be achieved."

To investigate why coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6) had replaced enterovirus A71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) which used to be the most predominant etiological agents for hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in children in Beijing, China.
Methods
A total of 64 CVA6-positive samples identified from 2010 to 2016 were selected for whole-genome sequences amplification and analysis.
Results
It was demonstrated that the sequences for whole-genomes of CVA6s in this study were 7432∼7435 nucleotides in length, and the different lengths were only in the 5'UTR regions. The phylogenetic tree analysis of the full-length VP1 regions of CVA6s indicated that the prevalent CVA6s in Beijing changed from the previous D2 sub-genotype to the D3 sub-genotype in 2013. In this study, two recombinant froms (RFs)-C and D of CVA6 appeared mainly in 2010 and 2011. Since 2013, three recombinant CVA6 variants, RF-A, J and L, have been prevalent in children with HFMD in Beijing. The recombination region of RF-J was located at the 2C region, while RF-L had the new recombination point in the 3D region. The recombination of prevalent CVA6s in Beijing from 2013 to 2016 occurred within noncapid regions of the genome, especially the regions of the P2 and P3.
Conclusions
Sub-genotype change and recombination of CVA6s indicated from this study may explain why CVA6 has become the predominant pathogen causing HFMD since 2013."

Discriminating active tuberculosis (ATB) from latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) remains challenging. This study aimed to investigate a diagnostic model based on a combination of iron metabolism and the TB-specific antigen/phytohemagglutinin ratio (TBAg/PHA ratio) in T-SPOT.TB assay for differentiation between ATB and LTBI.
Methods
A total of 345 participants with ATB (n=191) and LTBI (n=154) were recruited based on positive T-SPOT.TB results at Tongji hospital between January 2017 and January 2020. Iron metabolism analysis was performed simultaneously. A diagnostic model for distinguishing ATB from LTBI was established according to multivariate logistic regression.
Results
The TBAg/PHA ratio showed 64.00% sensitivity and 90.10% specificity in distinguishing ATB from LTBI when a threshold of 0.22 was used. All iron metabolism biomarkers in the ATB group were significantly different from those in the LTBI group. Specifically, serum ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor in ATB were significantly higher than LTBI. On the contrary, serum iron, transferrin, total iron binding capacity, and unsaturated iron binding capacity in ATB were significantly lower than LTBI. The combination of iron metabolism indicators accurately predicted 60.00% of ATB cases and 91.09% of LTBI subjects, respectively. Moreover, the combination of iron metabolism indexes and TBAg/PHA ratio resulted in a sensitivity of 88.80% and specificity of 90.10%. Furthermore, the performance of models established in the Qiaokou cohort was confirmed in the Caidian cohort.
Conclusions
The data suggest that the combination of iron metabolism indexes and TBAg/PHA ratio could serve as a biomarker to distinguish ATB from LTBI in T-SPOT-positive individuals."

A major open question, affecting the decisions of policy makers, is the estimation of the true number of Covid-19 infections. Most of them are undetected, because of a large number of asymptomatic cases. We provide an efficient, easy to compute and robust lower bound estimator for the number of undetected cases.
Methods
A modified version of the Chao estimator is proposed, based on the cumulative time-series distributions of cases and deaths. Heterogeneity has been addressed by assuming a geometrical distribution underlying the data generation process. An (approximated) analytical variance of the estimator has been derived to compute reliable confidence intervals at 95% level.
Results
A motivating application to the Austrian situation is provided and compared with an independent and representative study on prevalence of Covid-19 infection. Our estimates match well with the results from the independent prevalence study, but the capture–recapture estimate has less uncertainty involved as it is based on a larger sample size. Results from other European countries are mentioned in the discussion. The estimated ratio of the total estimated cases to the observed cases is around the value of 2.3 for all the analyzed countries.
Conclusions
The proposed method answers to a fundamental open question: “How many undetected cases are going around?”. CR methods provide a straightforward solution to shed light on undetected cases, incorporating heterogeneity that may arise in the probability of being detected."

The aim was to fully characterize the plasma and urine washout pharmacokinetics of tenofovir (TFV) in adults following 6 weeks of controlled levels of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) adherence, in order to inform the utility of clinic-based adherence testing.
Design
This was a three-arm, randomized, open-label study in adult volunteers. Participants were randomized to receive TDF 300 mg/emtricitabine (FTC) 200 mg as (1) 7 doses/week (perfect adherence), (2) 4 doses/week (moderate adherence), or (3) 2 doses/week (low adherence). Plasma and urine samples were collected regularly during the 6-week dosing phase and for 4 weeks following drug cessation.
Results
Twenty-eight adults were included in this analysis. Median (range) age was 33 (20–49) years. No differences in TFV pharmacokinetic parameters during the washout were observed across the study arms. Small differences in TFV plasma concentrations occurred across arms between 4 and 10 h post-dose. The cumulative amount of TFV excreted in urine was not different at 24 h post-dose, but at 148 h it was 24.8 mg, 21.0 mg, and 17.2 mg for the perfect, moderate, and low adherence arms, respectively (p = 0.043).
Conclusions
Among adults with different TDF adherence patterns, relative differences in plasma concentrations and cumulative urine extraction of TFV were minor following cessation. TFV measurement in plasma or urine is more indicative of last drug ingestion, rather than prior dose patterns."

abstract = "Background
In Italy, dengue virus is the most frequent agent of imported viral infections. The use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) may be of help as a preliminary user-friendly quick assay to facilitate dengue diagnosis, as ordinary laboratory diagnosis of dengue fever may require special efforts in terms of tools availability, interpretation of results, and skilled personnel. The performance of RDTs, however, may vary according to different epidemiological and laboratory background.
Methods
We reviewed five years of laboratory records of two dengue RDT results (Colorimetric SD-Bioline Dengue-Duo-RDT and Fluorimetric SD-Biosensor-STANDARD-F-Dengue-RDT), able to detect viral NS1 antigen and specific IgM and IgG. Diagnostic parameters were calculated using as reference the results of molecular (RT-PCR) and serological (immunofluorescence, IFA) tests. Overall performance, calculated considering the final case definition, was included in the accuracy assessment of RDTs.
Results
The combined use of NS1 and IgM/IgG RDT for the detection of acute dengue cases resulted in an overall sensitivity and specificity of 87.2% and 97.9% for Colorimetric RDT, 96.2% and 96.2% for Fluorimetric RDT. NS1 was the most reliable marker of acute infection, while IgM resulted falsely positive in nine samples, including sera derived from 2 Zika and 4 non-arbovirus infected patients.
Conclusions
The inclusion of RDT in the diagnostic algorithm is of undeniable help in the prompt management and surveillance of dengue infection in non-endemic areas. Confirmatory tests are, however, necessary to rule in or rule out dengue fever diagnosis."

In 2019, a small HAdV55-associated outbreak of adenovirus infection occurred among the intensive care unit (ICU) staff in Xiangya Hospital of Central South University in Hunan Province, China during the treatment of a patient.
Objective
To investigate the characteristics of a nosocomial adenovirus outbreak in the ICU.
Methods
We evaluated all the patients treated and the medical staff working in the ICU from August 1 to September 4, 2019. We further performed an epidemiological and molecular analysis for this outbreak from patient to healthcare workers and between healthcare workers. After the outbreak, we adopted exposure prevention and droplet prevention measures based on standard precautions.
Measurements and Main Results
Between August 1 and August 27, 2019, 27 cases of human adenovirus cross-infection were reported in our institution. Among the cases, 11 were doctors (41%), 11 were nurses (41%), three were respiratory therapists (11%), and two were caregivers (7%). The attack rate was 28.4% and the fatality rate was 0. The results showed that contact with the index case, lack of hand hygiene or gloving adherence was a risk factor for infection after adenovirus exposure. After taking specific precautions, no new cases of infection have appeared since August 27.
Conclusions
Our results show that HAdV55 in a single patient had strong transmission potential in an intensive care unit with adequate facilities and standardized operation. We provide convincing evidence indicating that attention could be highlighted the role of standard and specific precautions in controlling the spread of adenovirus in ICUs."

Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) is one of the most frequent causes of hospital admission in children. Our objective is to measure the impact of the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines on the hospitalization of previously healthy children due to CAP.
Method
From 2011 to 2016, a partially retrospective, prospective, and descriptive study was carried out on healthy pediatric patients (3 months–14 years old) with CAP, who required hospital admission. Clinical, epidemiological, and demographic characteristics were collected, and vaccination status was obtained from medical records.
Results
A total of 292 cases were included, with a mean age of 33.4 months, 54% males. There was a progressive and significant 42% decrease in the number of admissions each year, without significant changes in the annual percentage of parapneumonic pleural effusion (PPE). Fifty-six percent of patients were immunized with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV). The percentage of children who were not vaccinated decreased by 14%, and the coverage with PCV-13 increased by 46%. This revealed a significant increase of PPE in vaccinated patients with PCV-7 (63%) compared with unvaccinated (45%) and with PCV-13 (57%), without association with the presence of severe PPE. Moreover, no significant differences in severity or hospital stay were observed in unvaccinated patients, compared to those who were vaccinated. In >2-year-olds, we observed a significant increase in PPE (59%) compared to 45% in younger children.
Conclusions
The increase in vaccination coverage with PCV-13 resulted in a decrease in hospitalizations due to CAP and PPE. Vaccination with PCV-7 is associated in our sample with an increase in PPE but not with severe PPE nor an increase in the hospital stay. There was an epidemiological shift of severe forms of pneumonia and empyema at later ages (>2 years)."

In Denmark, tuberculous lymphadenitis (TBLA) is the most common extrapulmonary manifestation of tuberculosis (TB). Yet, the clinical features of these patients have never been studied systematically in our setting.
Methods
Patients treated for TBLA in Central Region Denmark from 2007 through 2016 were identified using the national TB surveillance register and The Danish Hospital Patient Registry. Data of clinical characteristics and treatment was extracted from hospital records.
Results
We identified 83 TBLA patients. Median age was 32 (IQR 23-42), 85.5% (n = 71) were migrants. 69.9% (n = 58) presented with cervical lymphadenopathy. 54.2% of the patients (n = 45) had one or more systemic TB symptoms such as fever, chills, night sweats, fatigue, and weight loss. Most patients had no comorbidities (n = 65, 78.3%) and HIV-coinfection was only seen among 7.2% (n = 5) of the 69 that were HIV-tested. Abscesses and/or draining sinuses were noted for 15.7% (n = 13) and 18.1% (n = 15) had concurrent pulmonary infection. The median time from first hospital contact to treatment initiation was 42 days (IQR, 16-82) and admitted patients were hospitalized for a median of 7 days (IQR, 3-13.5).

The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic shocked the world, overwhelming the health systems of even high-income countries. Predictably, the situation has elicited social and medical responses from the public and governments, respectively. Nigeria recorded an imported case from Italy on February 27, 2020. Hence, this paper assesses the early socio-medical response to COVID-19 in Nigeria in the first 100 days after the index case. The paper employs analytical methods and collates data from various media reports and official sources.
Findings
The incidence of COVID-19 grew steadily in Nigeria, moving from an imported case and elitist pattern to community transmission. The case fatality stood at 2.8%. The country recorded an upsurge (52% of total cases) in the transmission of COVID-19 during the short period the lockdown was relaxed. This paper presents a concise response framework to highlight some specific multisectoral responses to the pandemic. A combination of social and medical responses to a large extent helped Nigeria curtail the spread of the virus.
Conclusion
The potential of overwhelming COVID-19 is still imminent in Nigeria as the country is attempting to hurriedly open the economy, which could sacrifice public health gains for temporary economic gains."

abstract = "Objectives
In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, the development and validation of rapid and easy-to-perform diagnostic methods are of high priority. We evaluated a novel rapid antigen detection test (RDT) for SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples.
Methods
The fluorescence immunochromatographic SARS-CoV-2 antigen test (Bioeasy Biotechnology Co., Shenzhen, China) was evaluated using universal transport medium with nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs from suspected Covid-19 cases. Diagnostic accuracy was determined in comparison to SARS-CoV-2 real time (RT)-PCR.
Results
A total of 127 samples were included; 82 were RT-PCR positive. Median patients’ age was 38 years, 53.5% were male, and 93.7% were from the first week after symptom onset. Overall sensitivity and specificity were 93.9% (CI95% 86.5–97.4) and 100% (CI95% 92.1–100), respectively, with a diagnostic accuracy of 96.1% and Kappa coefficient of 0.9. Sensitivity was significantly higher in samples with high viral loads.
Conclusions
The evaluated RDT showed a high sensitivity and specificity in samples mainly obtained during the first week of symptoms and with high viral loads, despite the use of a non-validated sample material. The assay has the potential to become an important tool for early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in situations with limited access to molecular methods."

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic, but the factors influencing viral RNA shedding remain unclear to inform optimal control strategies.
Methods
The clinical course and viral RNA shedding pattern of 267 consecutive symptomatic COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital from January 20, 2020 to March 15, 2020 were retrospectively evaluated.
Results
The median viral RNA shedding duration was 12 days (interquartile range, 8–16 d) after the onset of illness. Of the 267 patients included in this study, 65.2% had viral RNA cleared within 14 days, 88.8% within 21 days, and 94.4% within 28 days. Older age (hazard ratio [HR], 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.98–1.00; P = 0.04), time lag from illness onset to hospital admission (HR, 0.91; 95% CI: 0.88–0.94; P < 0.001), diarrhea (HR, 0.59; 95% CI: 0.36–0.96; P = 0.036), corticosteroid treatment (HR, 0.60; 95% CI: 0.39–0.94; P = 0.024), and lopinavir/ritonavir use (HR, 0.70; 95% CI: 0.52–0.94; P = 0.014) were significantly independently associated with prolonged viral RNA shedding.
Conclusions
Early detection and timely hospital admission may be warranted for symptomatic COVID-19 patients, especially for older patients and patients with diarrhea. Corticosteroid treatment is associated with prolonged viral RNA shedding and should be used with caution. Lopinavir/ritonavir use may be associated with prolonged viral RNA shedding in non-severe patients; further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm this finding."

abstract = "Background
Surgical site infection (SSI) after colorectal surgery (CRS) remains a significant problem for its negative clinical outcomes. However, it is poorly understood in China. This study aims to investigate the incidence, risk factors and microbiology of SSI after CRS.
Methods
A nationwide prospective multicenter design was applied. Patients in 19 Chinese hospitals from 2015 to 2018 were prospectively monitored for SSI after CRS. Demographic data, hospital characteristics, and potential perioperative risk factors were collected and analyzed, using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models.
Results
Among 3,663 study participants, 134(3.66%) episodes of SSI were identified. The incidence rate of SSI decreased from 5.9 infections per 100 procedures in 2015 to 3.1 infections per 100 procedures in 2018 (incidence rate ratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.28–0.94). The SSI rates were 1.88, 4.15, 6.27 and 11.58 per 100 operations for the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance system (NNIS) risk index categories of 0, 1, and 2 or 3, respectively. Escherichia coli (54/134, 40.3%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (10/134, 7.5%) were the most frequently isolated microorganisms. A high prevalence of antibiotic resistance were observed in our study, with rates of extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing or carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia of 50.0%(27/54) and 30.0%(3/10) respectively. Preoperative hospital stay ≥ 48h (OR=2.28, 95% CI: 1.03-5.02, P=0.042) and contaminated or dirty wound (OR=3.38, 95% CI: 1.88-6.06, P=4.50×10−5) were significantly associated with increasing risk of SSI after CRS.
Conclusion
A statistically significant but modest decrease in the incidence rate of CRS SSI over the 4-year study period was observed in this study. Noticeably, the relatively high rates of multidrug-resistant pathogens causing SSI after CRS should be alert, while more studies with large population are needed due to the small number of isolates identified in our survey."

Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is recognized as a major cause of encephalitis in Bangladesh. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends human immunization as the most effective means to control JE. Several WHO-prequalified vaccines are available to prevent JE but no vaccination program has been implemented in Bangladesh.
Methods
We conducted hospital-based surveillance for acute meningitis-encephalitis syndrome (AMES) to describe JE epidemiology and help inform policy decisions about possible immunization strategies for Bangladesh.
Results
During 2007–2016, a total of 6,543 AMES patients were identified at four tertiary hospitals. Of the 6,525 patients tested, 548 (8%) were classified as JE cases. These 548 patients resided in 36 (56%) out of 64 districts of Bangladesh, with the highest proportion of JE cases among AMES patients (12% and 7%) presenting at two hospitals in the northwestern part of the country. The median age of JE cases was 30 years, and 193 (35%) were aged ≤15 years. The majority of JE cases (80%) were identified from July through November.
Conclusions
Surveillance results suggest that JE continues to be an important cause of meningo-encephalitis in Bangladesh. Immunization strategies including JE vaccine introduction into the routine childhood immunization program or mass vaccination in certain age groups or geographic areas need to be examined, taking into consideration the cost-effectiveness ratio of the approach and potential for decreasing disease burden."

The aim of the study was to analyze the usefulness of CURB-65 and the pneumonia severity index (PSI) in predicting 30-day mortality in patients with COVID-19, and to identify other factors associated with higher mortality.
Methods
A retrospective study was performed in a pandemic hospital in Istanbul, Turkey, which included 681 laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19. Data on characteristics, vital signs, and laboratory parameters were recorded from electronic medical records. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to quantify the discriminatory abilities of the prognostic scales. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify other predictors of mortality.
Results
Higher CRP levels were associated with an increased risk for mortality (OR: 1.015, 95% CI: 1.008–1.021; p < 0.001). The PSI performed significantly better than CURB-65 (AUC: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.88–0.93 vs AUC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.85–0.90; p = 0.01), and the addition of CRP levels to PSI did not improve the performance of PSI in predicting mortality (AUC: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.88–0.93 vs AUC: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.89–0.94; p = 0.29).

Convalescent plasma (CP) has been used successfully to treat many types of infectious diseases, and it has shown initial effects in the treatment of the emerging 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). However, its curative effect and feasibility have yet to be confirmed by formal evaluation and well-designed clinical trials. To explore the effectiveness of treatment and predict the potential effect of CP for COVID-19, studies of different types of infectious diseases treated with CP were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis.
Methods
Related studies were obtained from databases and screened based on the inclusion criteria. The data quality was assessed, and the data were extracted and pooled for analysis.
Results
We included 40 studies on CP treatment for infectious diseases We found that CP treatment could reduce the risk of mortality with a low incidence of adverse events, promote the production of antibodies, show the decline in viral load, and shorten the disease course. A meta-analysis of 15 controlled studies showed that there was a significantly lower mortality rate in the group treated with CP (pooled OR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.19-0.52, P < 0.001, I2 = 54%) than in the control groups. Studies were mostly of low or very low quality with a moderate or high risk of bias. The sources of clinical and methodological heterogeneity were identified. The exclusion of heterogeneity indicated that the results were stable.
Conclusions
CP therapy has some curative effect and is well tolerated to treat infectious diseases. It is a potentially effective treatment for COVID-19."

Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are common pathogens that can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal and other infections. We investigated the correlation between adenovirus viral load in clinical respiratory samples and the respiratory disease severity in pediatric patients.
Methods
Medical records of patients hospitalized in the Sheba Medical Center (SMC) with confirmed adenovirus infection were retrospectively analyzed. The possible correlation between disease severity score and Real time PCR ‘cycle threshold’ (Ct), a proxy of viral load, was assessed in patients aged 9 years and under. In addition, Ct values of hospitalized versus community-care patient samples, positive for various respiratory viruses including adenovirus, were compared.
Results
Adenovirus load in respiratory samples, as measured by Ct values, was found to be negatively correlated with respiratory disease severity in hospitalized pediatric patients aged under 9 years. Moreover, hospitalized patients presented with significantly higher Ct levels for various respiratory viruses as compared to community-care patients.
Conclusion
In this study we found a correlation between Ct values obtained from adenovirus q-PCR analysis of respiratory clinical samples and disease severity in patients aged 9 years and under. Such finding may serve as a predictor of respiratory disease course in pediatric patients and will be beneficial for the differential diagnosis and treatment of pediatric patients."

Cross sectional study of 252 HIV infected children < 15 years old suspected with TB at four HIV/AIDS Care Clinics in Dodoma, Tanzania from November 2018 - March 2019. The modified Keith Edwards TB clinical diagnostic tool was compared to gastric aspirates, lymphnode aspirates or sputum gene x-pert MTB/RIF and TB culture. Sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive value of the clinical tool were determined. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 25.
Results
Out of 252 children evaluated, 13.5% (34/252) had TB using the clinical diagnostic tool and 5.2% (13/252) had culture positive TB. The sensitivity of the clinical tool was 76.9%, specificity of 90%. Culture positive TB predictors were lymphadenopathy (AOR 13.74, 95%CI (3.86 – 48.86) p value < 0.001), weight loss (AOR 3.19,95%CI (1.38 – 7.36) p value 0.007), and difficulty breathing (AOR 7.25, 95%CI (1.54 – 34.16) p value 0.012).
Conclusion
The utility of the modified Keith Edwards clinical diagnostic tool for Tuberculosis diagnosis among HIV infected children is limited, calling for further validation. HIV infected children with lymphadenopathy, failure to thrive and difficulty in breathing are at high risk of Tuberculosis."

We used electronic databases to identify eligible patients to be included in a retrospective cohort study. Inclusion criteria were (i) SABU, (ii) ≥18 years of age and (iii) ≥1 blood culture sampled ±3 months of SABU. Patients with missing values for demographic (e.g. age, sex) or clinical characteristics (e.g. comorbidities) and laboratory analyses were excluded.
Results
In total, 245 patients attending the University Hospital Münster, Germany between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2019 met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Of the 245 patients with SABU, 66 had a concomitant SAB (26.9%). Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were associated with SAB. Other parameters (e.g. leukocytes, comorbidities) were not associated with SAB in a multivariate analysis.
Conclusion
The frequency of SAB in patients with SABU was high and warrants active screening for bloodstream infections in hospitalized patients, particularly if CRP levels are elevated."

Outbreak investigations typically focus their efforts on identifying cases that present at healthcare facilities. However, these cases rarely represent all cases in the wider community. In this context, community-based investigations may provide additional insight into key risk factors for infection, however, the benefits of these more laborious data collection strategies remains unclear.
Methods
We used different subsets of the data from a comprehensive outbreak investigation to compare the inferences we make in alternative investigation strategies.
Results
The outbreak investigation team interviewed 1,933 individuals from 460 homes. 364 (18%) of individuals had symptoms consistent with chikungunya. A theoretical clinic-based study would have identified 26% of the cases. Adding in community-based cases provided an overall estimate of the attack rate in the community. Comparison with controls from the same household revealed that those with at least secondary education had a reduced risk. Finally, enrolling residents from households across the community allowed us to characterize spatial heterogeneity of risk and identify the type of clothing usually worn and travel history as risk factors. This also revealed that household-level use of mosquito control was not associated with infection.
Conclusions
These findings highlight that while clinic-based studies may be easier to conduct, they only provide limited insight into the burden and risk factors for disease. Enrolling people who escaped from infection, both in the household and in the community allows a step change in our understanding of the spread of a pathogen and maximizes opportunities for control."

Little is known about the association between genetic susceptibility and the severity of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) infected with coxsackievirus A6 (CV-A6).
Methods
Totally, 364 CV-A6 HFMD patients were enrolled, including 115 severe and 249 mild patients. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed involving eight DNA pools of 115 severe and 115 mild CV-A6 HFMD patients pair-matched by age and gender. Differences in relative allele signal scores of SNPs in Illumina Human OmniZhongHua-8 BeadChips were compared between the two groups. Potentially functional SNPs or their high linked SNPs were selected for individual genotyping in the whole 364 patients, and assessed their associations with severe CV-A6 HFMD using multivariable logistic regression analyses.
Results
Top 30 significant SNPs obtained from pooled DNA GWAS analysis were checked biological functions together with their high linkage disequilibrium (LD) SNPs. Four tagSNPs (rs1558206, rs6927647, rs9375728 and rs10879355) were selected for further individual genotyping in 364 CV-A6 patients. Only SNP rs10879355 was associated with severe CV-A6 HFMD, with CC genotype having a greater risk of severe illness than TT + TC genotypes (OR = 2.48, 95%CI: 1.34, 4.56). SNP rs4290270 is in complete LD with rs10879355 in Chinese Han children.

Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) remain a significant public threat with high morbidity and mortality worldwide; viruses are significant pathogens that cause ARIs. This study was conducted to better understand the epidemiological characteristics of respiratory viruses circulating in southern China.
Methods
We collected 22,680 respiratory samples from ARI patients in 18 hospitals in southern China during 2009–2018; seven common respiratory viruses including Flu, RSV, PIV, hMPV, ADV, HCoV, and HBoV were screened using in-house real-time PCR.
Results
Of all samples, 9760 ARI cases (9760/22680, 43.03%) tested positive for the seven common respiratory viruses. The most detected virus was Flu (14.15%), followed by RSV (10.33%) and PIV (5.43%); Flu-A, PIV3, and HCoV-OC43 were the predominant subtypes. Although most of the viruses were detected in male inpatients, Flu was more likely detected in female outpatients. Flu infection was more likely to cause URTI (upper respiratory tract infection), whereas RSV infection was more likely to cause pneumonia and bronchitis. The prevalence of Flu was particularly high in 2009. The epidemic level was found notably high in 2014–2018 for RSV, in 2016–2018 for PIV, in the summer of 2018 for ADV, in the summer of 2016 and winter of 2018 for HCoV, and in the summer of 2011 and autumn of 2018 for HBoV. The co-detection rate of the seven viruses was 4.70%; RSV, PIV, and Flu were the most commonly co-detected viruses.

The purpose of this study was to explore the role of mNGS in the diagnosis of PJI by detecting the presence of bacteria in periprosthetic tissues.
Methods
Patients who were suspected of PJI and underwent surgery in our center were enrolled. Microbial culture and mNGS were performed on periprosthetic tissues collected intraoperatively. Patient age, body mass index (BMI), laboratory tests, microbial culture and mNGS results were recorded. The diagnostic performance of microbial culture and mNGS in the diagnosis of PJI was compared.
Results
A total of 44 patients were included. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy of periprosthetic tissue microbial culture in the diagnosis of PJI were 72.72%, 77.27%, 76.19%, 73.91% and 75%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy of periprosthetic tissue mNGS in the diagnosis of PJI were 95.45%, 90.91%, 91.3%, 95.24% and 93.18%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of mNGS in the diagnosis of PJI were superior to those of microbial culture.
Conclusion
Periprosthetic tissue can be used as an alternative to synovial fluid and sonication fluid, as mNGS can improve the diagnosis of PJI. mNGS of the periprosthetic tissues showed higher sensitivity than microbial culture."

Few studies have explored the different lineages of influenza B viruses which cause excess death. This study was aimed to estimate age- and sex-specific excess mortality associated with influenza subtypes/lineages in Shanghai, during 2010–2015.
Methods
We used quasi-Poisson regression models to fit weekly numbers of deaths from various causes by adjusting long-term trend, seasonal trend, and absolute humidity as confounding factors. The mortality burden associated with influenza subtypes/lineages was estimated by age and sex.
Results
The average influenza-associated excess mortality rate in deaths coded as all-cause was 27.66(95%CI: 22.30-33.88) per 100,000 person-years. The excess deaths of 6 underlying causes in people aged ≥65 years weight heavily. Compared to influenza B(Victoria) lineage, influenza B(Yamagata) lineage had more effect on influenza-associated disease burden, particularly in patients with respiratory and circulatory diseases. There was no statistical significance in sex in mortality burden associated with influenza.
Conclusion
Excess mortality associated with influenza B virus is dominated by B(Yamagata) lineage in Shanghai and the evidence on sex differences in influenza-associated mortality burden for respiratory and circulatory diseases is limited. Improving vaccinating the elderly and strengthening the laboratory-based surveillance of influenza B lineages in Shanghai are needed to reduce the disease burden of influenza."

The mostly-resolved first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in China provided a unique opportunity to investigate how the initial characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak predict its subsequent magnitude.
Methods
We collected publicly available COVID-19 epidemiological data from 436 Chinese cities from 16th January–15th March 2020. Based on 45 cities that reported >100 confirmed cases, we examined the correlation between early-stage epidemic characteristics and subsequent epidemic magnitude.
Results
We identified a transition point from a slow- to a fast-growing phase for COVID-19 at 5.5 (95% CI, 4.6–6.4) days after the first report, and 30 confirmed cases marked a critical threshold for this transition. The average time for the number of confirmed cases to increase from 30 to 100 (time from 30-to-100) was 6.6 (5.3–7.9) days, and the average case-fatality rate in the first 100 confirmed cases (CFR-100) was 0.8% (0.2–1.4%). The subsequent epidemic size per million population was significantly associated with both of these indicators. We predicted a ranking of epidemic size in the cities based on these two indicators and found it highly correlated with the actual classification of epidemic size.
Conclusions
Early epidemic characteristics are important indicators for the size of the entire epidemic."

Methods
The study included five male patients who presented with the sole complaint of unilateral SSNHL to the otolaryngology outpatient clinic between 03–12 April 2020. The patients were referred to the infectious diseases clinic to be evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing.
Results
RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was positive in one of the patients and negative in the other four patients. A positive response to COVID-19-specific treatment in the SARS-CoV-2 positive SSNHL patient was noted.
Conclusion
It should be remembered that non-specific symptoms such as SSNHL could be the only sign with which to recognize a COVID-19 case. Awareness of such a non-specific presentation of COVID-19 patients is crucial during this pandemic period for preventing infectious spread through isolation and early initiation of COVID-19 targeted treatment."

Vaccination coverage is decreasing worldwide, favoring potential reemergence of vaccine-preventable disease. Here, we performed a longitudinal characterization of the vaccination coverage in Brazil and compared the profiles between the distinct regions in the country to test whether there has been a substantial change over the last five years.
Methods
We retrieved de-identified data publicly available from the repository of the Brazilian Ministry of Health, comprising detailed information on vaccination coverage, in all age groups, between 1994 and 2019. We examined the vaccination coverage from the whole country and each Brazilian region, by year, and performed a time-series pattern analysis.
Results
A significant decrease in overall vaccination coverage across the country regions was observed between 2017 and 2019, especially in childhood immunization. BCG, Hepatitis B, influenza and rotavirus vaccines displayed a reduction in coverage. Conversely, vaccines against measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, and meningococcus had an increase in coverage. Region-specific changes in vaccination patterns within the study period were observed.
Conclusions
Substantial reduction in vaccination coverage was detected in Brazil, a country already highly susceptible to emergency of epidemic infectious diseases. Recursively evaluation of the immunization program actions may help to improve vaccination coverage and prevent new epidemics."

With the increasing number of people suffering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is a dire need to look for effective remedies against this pandemic. Drug repurposing seems to be the solution for the current situation.
Methods
In a quest to find a potential drug against this virus, 15 antimalarial drugs (including chloroquine) and 2413 US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs were investigated for activity against both the protease and spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using an in silico approach. Molecular docking analysis followed by molecular dynamics simulation was performed to estimate the binding and stability of the complexes.
Results
This study identified a single drug – paromomycin – with activity against two targets of SARS-CoV-2, i.e., spike protein (S1) and protease domain. Paromomycin was found to have strong binding affinity for both targets of coronavirus. The results also showed that no antimalarial drug exhibited effective binding for either S1 or protease.
Conclusions
This study found that paromomycin may be an effective dual targeting drug against coronavirus, as it binds not only to the protease domain of the virion, but also to the spike domain, with high stability. Furthermore, none of the antimalarial drugs showed strong binding affinity for either protease or the receptor binding domain (RBD)."

This study evaluated 74 MDR-TB patients treated with Bdq, followed by Dlm (n = 22), or vice versa (n = 52), combined with optimised background regimens between March 2016 and December 2018.
Results
The mean age of the participants was 49.0 ± 15.8 years. Fifty-one (68.9%) of the participants were men. Fluoroquinolone-resistance was identified in 54 (72.9%) patients, including 20 (27.0%) with extensively drug-resistant TB. Of the 47 (63.5%) patients with positive cultures at the commencement of the first new drug, culture conversion occurred in 44 (93.6%). The interim treatment outcome after 12 months was favourable in 68/74 patients (91.9%). Of 148 episodes of new drug use, 137 (92.3%) completed 24 weeks of treatment. Of the 11 early discontinuation events, six patients stopped using a new drug due to adverse drug reactions that were not life-threatening, including one (1.4%) who stopped Bdq due to QT-prolongation.
Conclusions
Sequential use of the two new drugs appears to be an effective and safe option for MDR-TB patients with few treatment options."

Since the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, considerable attention has been paid to its epidemiology and clinical characteristics in children. However, it is also crucial for clinicians to differentiate COVID-19 from other respiratory infectious diseases, such as influenza viruses.
Methods
This was a retrospective study. Two groups of COVID-19 patients (n=57) and influenza A patients (n=59) were enrolled. We analyzed and compared their clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics and treatments.
Results
The proportions of cough (70.2%), fever (54.4%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (14.1%) in COVID-19 patients were lower than those of influenza A patients (98.3%, P<0.001; 84.7%, P<0.001; and 35.6%, P=0.007; respectively). In addition, COVID-19 patients showed significantly lower levels of leukocytes (7.87 vs. 9.89×109L–1, P=0.027), neutrophils (2.43 vs. 5.16×109L–1, P<0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP; 3.7 vs. 15.1mg/L, P=0.001) and procalcitonin (PCT; 0.09 vs. 0.68mm/h, P<0.001), while lymphocyte levels (4.58 vs. 3.56×109L–1; P=0.006) were significantly higher compared with influenza A patients. In terms of CT imaging, ground-glass opacification in chest CT was more common in COVID-19 patients than in influenza A patients (42.1% vs. 15%, P=0.032). In contrast, consolidation was more common in influenza A patients (25%) than in COVID-19 patients (5.2%, P=0.025).
Conclusion
The clinical manifestations and laboratory tests of COVID-19 children are milder than those of influenza A children under 5 years. Additionally, imaging results more commonly presented as ground-glass opacities in COVID-19 patients."

To use Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to determine weights for eleven criteria in order to prioritize COVID-19 non-critical patients for admission to hospital in healthcare settings with limited resources.
Methods
The MCDA was applied in two main steps: specification of criteria for prioritizing COVID-19 patients (and levels within each criterion); and determination of weights for the criteria based on experts’ knowledge and experience in managing COVID-19 patients, via an online survey. Criteria were selected based on available COVID-19 evidence with a focus on low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
Results
The most important criteria (mean weights, summing to 100%), are: PaO2 (16.3%); peripheral O2 saturation (15.9%); chest X-ray (14.1%); Modified Early Warning Score-MEWS (11.4%); respiratory rate (9.5%); comorbidities (6.5%); living with vulnerable people (6.4%); body mass index (5.6%); duration of symptoms before hospital evaluation (5.4%); CRP (5.1%); and age (3.8%).
Conclusions
At the beginning of a new pandemic, when evidence for disease predictors is limited or unavailable and effective national contingency plans are difficult to establish, the MCDA prioritization model could play a pivotal role in improving the response of health systems."

Methods
Newly diagnosed, culture-confirmed, pulmonary TB patients with HIV, enrolled in a clinical trial (NCT00933790) were retrospectively analyzed for IRIS occurrence. Risk factors and TB outcomes (for up to 18 months after initiation of anti-TB treatment [ATT]) were compared between patients experiencing IRIS (IRIS group) and those who did not (Non-IRIS group).
Results
TB-IRIS occurred in 28% (82/292) of patients. Significant baseline risk factors predisposing to TB-IRIS occurrence in univariate analysis were lower CD4+ T-cell count, CD4/CD8 ratio, hemoglobin levels, as well as presence of extra-pulmonary TB focus and higher HIV viral load, with the last two retaining significance in the multivariate analysis. After 2 months of ATT commencement, sputum smear conversion was documented in 45/80 (56.2%) vs. 124/194 (63.9%) (p = 0.23), culture conversion was 75/80 (93.7%) vs. 178/194 (91.7%) (p = 0.57) and the median decline in viral load (log10copies/mm3) being 2.7 in the IRIS vs. 1.1 in the non-IRIS groups (p < 0.0001), respectively. The unfavourable response to TB therapy was detected in 17/82 (20.7%) and 28/210 (13.3%) in the IRIS and non-IRIS groups, respectively (p = 0.14).

Alternative dosing strategies for β-lactams – the most common antibiotics used to treat critically ill patients with respiratory tract infections – have been recommended to maximize the duration of exposure and reduce drug resistance. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether extended infusion of antipseudomonal β-lactams improves mortality and clinical efficacy.
Methods
Two independent authors identified eligible trials by searching the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and ICHUSHI databases, in both English and Japanese, up to June 2019. Data were extracted from both randomized controlled and observational trials comparing extended infusion (≥3h) with intermittent infusion in critically ill patients. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Risk differences (RD) and 95% confidential intervals (CI) were calculated using a random-effects model and subgroup analyses were performed. Sensitivity and heterogeneity were also evaluated.
Results
Nine studies involving 1508 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Mortality was lower for extended infusion than for intermittent infusion (RD −0.10; 95% CI −0.15 to −0.04). However, no significant between-group differences in clinical success, length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay, and antibiotic duration were observed.

We searched PubMed® and Google® (1 December 2019 to 29 March 2020) and extracted age, laboratory findings, and computed tomography (CT) scans. Pooled incidence rates of clinical characteristics were analyzed using random-effect models.
Results
In total, 506 patients from 34 studies (68 single cases and 438 from case-series) with an asymptomatic course were identified. Patients with normal radiology were younger (19.59 ± 17.17 years) than patients with abnormal radiology (39.14 ± 26.70 years) (p-value = 0.013). Despite being asymptomatic, CT investigations revealed abnormalities in 62.2% of the cases; ground-glass opacities were most frequently observed (43.09% by meta-analysis).

Despite high mortality rates, physicians can alter the course of the Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB) by following recommended standards of care. We aim to assess the adherence of these guidelines and their impact on mortality.
Methods
Substudy from a prospective cohort of hospitalized patients with SAB from three hospitals from Peru. Hazard ratios were calculated using Cox proportional regression to evaluate the association between 30-day mortality and the performance of standards of care: removal of central venous catheters (CVC), follow-up blood cultures, echocardiography, correct duration, and appropriate definitive antibiotic therapy.
Results
150 cases of SAB were evaluated; 61.33% were MRSA. 30-day attributable mortality was 22.39%. CVC removal was done in 42.86% of patients. Follow-up blood cultures and echocardiograms were performed in 8% and 29.33% of cases, respectively. 81.33% of cases had appropriate empirical treatment, however, only 22.41% of MSSA cases were given appropriate definitive treatment, compared to 93.47% of MRSA. The adjusted regression for all-cause mortality found a substantial decrease in hazards when removing CVC (aHR 0.28, 95% CI: 0.10 - 0.74) and instituting appropriate definitive treatment (aHR 0.27, 95% CI: 0.08 - 0.86), while adjusting for standards of care, qPitt bacteraemia score, comorbidities, and methicillin susceptibility; similar results were found in the attributable mortality model (aHR 0.24, 95% CI: 0.08 - 0.70 and aHR 0.21, 95% CI: 0.06 - 0.71, respectively).

Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as an important nosocomial pathogen worldwide. In Thailand, the incidence and mortality rate of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) is continuously increasing. This organism is a common pathogen that can cause HAP and VAP. CRAB tends to be susceptible to only colistin, so colistin would be the last line of treatment for CRAB. The recent data from in-vitro studies found that colistin and meropenem combination therapy could exert synergistic effects. However, some in-vivo studies have shown no significant difference in antibacterial effect between colistin monotherapy and colistin plus meropenem. Moreover, the clinical data are recently limited and not clear. Thus, the objective of this study was to compare clinical outcome, microbiological response, mortality rate and nephrotoxicity between loading dose (LD) colistin monotherapy and LD colistin-meropenem for treatment of infection caused by CRAB in Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital.
Materials and Methods
This study is a retrospective analytical study. The data were collected from patients who received LD colistin monotherapy or LD colistin plus meropenem combination therapy for treatment of CRAB from 1 January 2013 to 31 August 2017 at Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital. A total of 324 patients met the inclusion criteria. The data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and inferential statistics, and were adjusted for confounding factors by logistic regression analysis.
Results
The adjusted OR of good clinical outcome of patients who received LD colistin plus meropenem was 1.05 times that of patients who received loading dose colistin monotherapy (95%CI 0.62-1.74, p=0.860). Patients who received LD colistin plus meropenem had 0.93 times (adjusted OR) mortality rate at the end of treatment compared to patients who received LD colistin monotherapy (95%CI=0.51-1.71, p=0.935). In addition, microbiological response was defined as eradication of pre-treatment isolated pathogens in post-treatment cultures. Patients who received LD colistin plus meropenem could eradicate pathogens 1.28 times more than LD colistin monotherapy (95% CI=0.74-2.20, p=0.371). Also there was no significant difference in nephrotoxicity (adjusted OR=0.84, 95% CI 0.52-1.36, p=0.492) between LD colistin monotherapy and LD colistin plus meropenem.
Conclusion
There were no significant differences in effectiveness and nephrotoxicity of LD colistin monotherapy versus LD colistin plus meropenem for treatment of CRAB infection, so colistin combination therapy was not necessary for the management of infection caused by CRAB."

abstract = "Objectives
The ability of clinical algorithms to identify tuberculosis disease and the impact of empiric treatment on survival in people with a negative Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) result remains poorly documented.
Methods
Hospitalized Xpert-negative patients (125 initiated on empiric tuberculosis treatment based on a clinical algorithm and 125 in whom tuberculosis treatment was not started) were enrolled. Sputum samples were evaluated for Mycobacterium tuberculosis by culture. All study participants were followed up for 6 months.
Results
Xpert-negative inpatients in whom empiric tuberculosis treatment was initiated were more likely to have microbiological confirmed tuberculosis compared to those in whom empiric tuberculosis treatment was not started (24.8% vs 6.4%, p=0.0001). Six-month risk of death was 5.2%, but the risk was twice as high in people with bacteriological confirmation of TB (10.3% vs 4.3%, p=0.12). Cardinal symptoms of TB were associated with bacteriological confirmation and a decision to start empiric treatment. The positive predictive value of the clinical algorithm was 24.8% and empiric treatment did not affect 6-month risk of death (5.6% vs 4.8%, p=0.78).
Conclusions
Clinical algorithm identifies the majority of confirmed tuberculosis cases among Xpert-negative inpatients. Empiric treatment did not impact survival and resulted in substantial overtreatment. The more sensitive Xpert Ultra assay should be used to eliminate the need for empiric tuberculosis treatment."

We aimed to determine the incidence and relative risk (RR) of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in patients with asplenia/hyposplenism using a nationwide population-based database.
Methods
From 2009–2018, all claimed cases of newly diagnosed asplenia/hyposplenism in the National Health Insurance Service in Korea were included. The incidence and RR of IPD in asplenia/hyposplenism patients were investigated using the Korean Center for Disease Control criteria.
Results
Fifty-seven IPD cases were identified among 21,376 patients with 82,748 person-years of exposure. The cumulative 8-year IPD incidence was 0.5%, and 45.6% of the infections occurred within 2 years after asplenia/hyposplenism diagnosis. The age-standardised incidence rate was 104.5 per 100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI], 103.6–105.4). Patients aged <5 years had a 15.1-times higher risk of IPD than those aged ≥60 years (95% CI: 5.8–39.5, p < 0.0001). The RR of IPD was 32.0 times higher in patients with asplenia/hyposplenism than in the general population (95% CI, 21.7–47.0); the standardised incidence ratio was 17.9(95% CI, 11.8–26.0).
Conclusions
This large population-based study highlights the high IPD incidence rate and RR in Korean patients with asplenia/hyposplenism. Increased awareness and effective prevention strategies are needed for these high-risk populations, especially children aged <5 years."

To evaluate the therapeutic use of plasma exchange in COVID-19 patients compared to controls.
Methods
Case series of critically ill adult men and non-pregnant women, ≥18 years of age, with laboratory confirmed COVID-19, was conducted at the Royal Hospital, Oman, from April 17th to May 11th, 2020. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) was performed on patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) with confirmed or imminent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or severe pneumonia. Analysis was performed using univariate statistics.
Results
A total of 31 COVID-19 patients were included with an overall mean age of 51 ± 15 years (range: 27-76 years), 90% (n = 28) were males, and 35% (n = 11) of the patients had TPE as a mode of treatment. The TPE group was associated with higher extubation rates than the non-TPE cohort (73% versus 20%; p =  0.018). Additionally, patients on TPE had a lower 14 days (0 versus 35%; p =  0.033) and 28 days (0 versus 35%; p =  0.033) all-cause mortality compared to patients not on TPE. However, all-cause mortality was only marginally lower in the TPE group compared to the non-TPE group (9.1% versus 45%; p =  0.055; power = 66%). Laboratory and ventilatory parameters also improved with the TPE.
Conclusions
The use of TPE in severe COVID-19 patients has been associated with improved outcomes, however, randomized controlled clinical trials are warranted to draw final conclusive findings."

abstract = "Objectives
Existing findings regarding the relationship between comorbidities and Covid-19 severity is inconsistent and insufficient. The present study aimed to evaluate the association between different comorbidities and the severity of Covid-19.
Methods
PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched to identify studies reporting on the rate of comorbidities in Covid-19 patients with severe/fatal outcomes. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to disease severity, and the country of residence. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using random-effects models.
Results
A total of 34 eligible studies were identified. In patients with severe/fatal Covid-19, the most prevalent chronic comorbidity was obesity (42%, 95CI 34-49%) and hypertension (40%, 95%CI 35-45%), followed by diabetes (17%, 95%CI 15-20%), cardiovascular disease (13%, 95%CI 11-15%), respiratory disease (8%, 95%CI 6-10%), cerebrovascular disease (6%, 95%CI 4-8%), malignancy (4%, 95% CI 3-6%), kidney disease (3%, 95%CI 2-4%), and liver disease (2%, 95%CI 1-3%). In order of the prediction, the pooled ORs of the chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, cerebrovascular disease, malignancy, diabetes, and obesity in patients with severe or fatal Covid-19 were (OR 3.56, 95%CI 2.87-4.41), (OR 3.17, 95%CI 2.46-4.08), (OR 3.13, 95%CI 2.65-3.70), (OR 3.02, 95%CI 2.23-4.08), (OR 2.74, 95%CI 1.59-4.74), (OR 2.73, 95%CI 1.73-4.21), (OR 2.63, 95%CI 2.08-3.33), and (OR 1.72, 95%CI 1.04-2.85), respectively, compared with patients with non-severe/fatal Covid-19. No correlation was observed between liver disease and Covid-19 aggravation (OR 1.54, 95%CI 0.95-2.49).
Conclusions
Chronic comorbidities, including obesity, hypertension, diabetes, cardia-cerebrovascular disease, respiratory disease, kidney disease, and malignancy, are clinical risk factors of severe or fatal outcomes associated with Covid-19, with obesity being the most prevalent, and respiratory disease being the most strongly predictive. Knowledge of these risk factors can help clinicians better identify and guide the high-risk populations."

Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist was followed and Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal checklist used for assessing the quality. Risk of bias assessed using forest plot and Egger’s regression test. Data were analyzed using STATA version 15 and Review Manager Software version 5.3.
Results
The overall pooled proportion of poor treatment outcome and mortality was 17.86% and 15.13% respectively. The incidence density rate of poor treatment outcome and mortality was 10.41/1000 person-months and 9.28/1000 person-months respectively. Survival status and successful treatment outcomes were 76.97% and 63.82% respectively. HIV positivity, non-HIV comorbidities, clinical complications, extrapulmonary involvement, undernutrition, anemia, treatment delay, lower body weight, and older age were the predictors of poor treatment outcome.
Conclusion
Better survival and treatment success rates noted in Ethiopia as compared to the global average. The majority of the poor treatment outcomes occurred within the intensive phase. Early initiation of anti-tuberculosis treatment would be important for successful treatment outcomes."

Disseminated Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) disease (BCGosis) is a classical feature of children with primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDs).
Methods
A 15-year retrospective review was conducted in KK Women's and Children's Hospital in Singapore, from January 2003 to October 2017.
Results
Ten patients were identified, the majority male (60.0%). The median age at presentation of symptoms of BCG infections was 3.8 (0.8 – 7.4) months. All the patients had likely underlying PIDS – four with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), three with Mendelian Susceptibility to Mycobacterial Diseases (MSMD), one with Anhidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia with Primary Immunodeficiency (EDA-ID), one with combined immunodeficiency (CID), and one with STAT-1 gain-of-function mutation. Definitive BCGosis was confirmed in all patients by the identification of Mycobacterium bovis subsp BCG from microbiological cultures. The susceptibility profiles of Mycobacterium bovis subsp BCG are as follows: Rifampicin (88.9%), Isoniazid (44.47%), Ethambutol (100.0%), Streptomycin (100.0%), Kanamycin (100.0%), Ethionamide (25.0%), and Ofloxacin (100.0%). Four patients (40.0%) received a three-drug regimen. Five patients (50.0%) underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), of which three (60%) have recovered. Overall mortality was 50.0%.
Conclusion
Disseminated BCG disease (BCGosis) should prompt immunology evaluation to determine the diagnosis of the immune defect. A three-drug regimen is adequate for treatment if the patient undergoes early HSCT."

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been widely spread. We aim to investigate the dynamic changes of peripheral blood lymphocytes subsets in adult patients with COVID-19.
Methods
Electronic medical records including demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory data, and radiological materials of 435 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with confirmed result of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, were extracted and retrospectively analyzed. The counts of lymphocyte subsets at each week after the onset of the illness were compared with other weeks of illness and with those from normal individuals.
Results
The various lymphocyte subsets (CD3 +, CD4 +, CD8 +, CD19 +and CD16/56 +) were below the normal ranges at the first week after the onset of the illness, reaching a nadir during the second week, which increased gradually in the third week and returned to normal levels in the fifth week, but was still lower than the healthy controls. The CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ counts were significantly lower in those with severe disease compared to those with non-severe disease, and in those patients that died compared to those who recovered.
Discussion
our research indicates that the levels of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets (CD3 +, CD4 +, and CD8 +) are associated with disease progression, severity, and prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Dynamic monitoring of human immune function is one of the indicators for evaluating the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients, and it is helpful to formulate appropriate treatment strategies."

To describe the clinical and epidemiological profiles of HIV-infected Omani children before and after the implementation of the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) programme.
Methods
A retrospective review of HIV-infected children seen at a national paediatric HIV unit between 1992 and 2015 was performed.
Results
Ninety-one HIV-infected children were identified; 59 (65%) were ≤5 years of age at diagnosis, with 28 (47.5%) of these being <1 year old. The average annual incidence of infection per million children (≤14 years old) was 5.7, and the highest (11.6) was in 2010. At diagnosis, 48 (60%) patients had a CD4 count of ˂200cells/mm3. The median HIV viral load was 81600copies/ml at diagnosis and 5911copies/ml at 12 months after HIV treatment (p=0.015). The median CD4 count was 586cells/mm3 at diagnosis and 800cells/mm3 at 12 months after therapy (p=0.004). Compared to those diagnosed before 2009 (n=68), HIV-infected children diagnosed after 2009 (n=22) were more likely to be asymptomatic at the time of HIV diagnosis (23.5% (16/68) vs. 59.1% (13/22); p=0.002) and to have a favourable clinical outcome (42.6% (29/68) vs. 86.4% (19/22); p<0001).
Conclusions
The number of HIV-infected children in Oman has decreased substantially since the introduction of the PMTCT programme.

Results
A total of 135 women were included, 40 pregnant and 95 non-pregnant. The frequency of severe hepatotoxicity was 40% in pregnant women and 6% among non-pregnant women (p < 0.001) (odds ratio 9.9; 95% confidence interval 3.5–28.0).

Results
Of 694 patients, severe cases accounted for 19.7% (137 patients). No severe case was observed among patients aged ≤19 years. Hypertension was the most common co-morbidity (27%), and cough was the most common symptom (59%). Besides, asymptomatic patients accounted for 14.4% of cases. Lymphopenia, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, and albumin were associated with severe outcomes. The first outbreak was mostly associated with younger age groups, and asymptomatic patients mostly showed mild progression. In the second outbreak involving a long-term care facility, both the number of severe patients and the mortality rate were high.

To provide data on the molecular characteristics of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates in Japan.
Methods
A total of 100 clinical isolates of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae collected throughout Japan between June and July 2018 were studied. ESBL genes were analyzed using PCR and DNA sequencing. Transferability of ESBL genes was investigated by conjugation experiments. Plasmid replicon types, virulence genes (rmpA, rmpA2, iucA, iroB, and peg-344) associated with hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKp), and capsule types were detected using PCR. Genotyping was performed using multilocus sequence typing.
Results
All ESBL-producing isolates carried blaCTX-M genes. The most predominant CTX-M-type identified was CTX-M-15 (n = 55). We identified 24 sequence types (STs) among the CTX-M-15 producers, with ST25 (n = 8) being the most common. Most of the transconjugants carrying blaCTX-M-15 contained the FIIk replicon. Of the 100 ESBL-producing isolates, 31 were hvKp defined by the presence of the virulence genes. These ESBL-producing hvKp isolates belonged to eight STs (STs 23, 25, 36, 65, 86, 268, 412, and 4492), with five capsule types (K1, K2, K20, K57, and undefined).
Conclusions
CTX-M-15 was the predominant ESBL among K. pneumoniae isolates from Japan. This study shows that ESBL-producing hvKp strains comprising various clones are emerging in Japan."

Genomic analysis showed emm1 isolates throughout China constituted distinct clades, enriched by the presence of mobile genetic elements carrying the multidrug resistant determinants ermB and tetM and virulence genes speA, speC, and spd1.
Conclusion
A significant increase in the proportion ofemm1 strains occurred in the GAS population causing scarlet fever in China. Ongoing surveillance is warranted to monitor the dynamic changes of GAS clones."

Previous studies on the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) have found strong correlations between online searches and the epidemiology of the disease.
Aim
Our aim was to determine if online searches for COVID-19 related to international media announcements or national epidemiology.
Methods
Searches for “coronavirus” were made on Google Trends from December 31, 2019 to April 13, 2020 for 40 European countries. The online COVID-19 searches for all countries were correlated with each other. COVID-10 epidemiology (i.e. incidence and mortality) was correlated with the national online searches. Major announcements by the World Health Organization (WHO) were taken into consideration with peaks in online searches. Correlations were made using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.
Results
Overall, the online searches for COVID-19 were not correlated with the actual incidence and mortality of COVID-19. The mean Spearman correlation for incidence was 0.20 (range −0.66 to 0.76) and for mortality was 0.35 (range −0.75 to 0.85). Online searches in Europe were all strongly synchronized with each other; a mean Spearman correlation of 0.93 (range 0.62 to 0.99).
Conclusions
Online searches for COVID-19 in Europe are not correlated with epidemiology but strongly correlated with international WHO announcements. Our study challenges previous Google Trends studies and emphasizes the role of the WHO in raising awareness of a new disease."

Related innate immune system activation and diagnostic factors of sepsis are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical value of full-length tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WRS) induced through inflammatory stimuli for the detection of sepsis and prediction of mortality in critically ill patients.
Methods
This was a retrospective analysis of blood samples collected prospectively from patients in the medical intensive care unit (ICU) at Yonsei University College of Medicine, from March 2015 to June 2018. The ability of WRS to detect sepsis and predict mortality were compared to those of procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin 6 (IL-6), and with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores.
Results
A total of 241 study patients were enrolled, of whom 190 (78.8%) had been diagnosed with sepsis on ICU admission. The areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUROCs) for sepsis discrimination with WRS, PCT, CRP, and IL-6 levels, and SOFA and APACHE II scores were 0.864, 0.727, 0.625, 0.651, 0.840, and 0.754, respectively. The prediction of 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis using WRS levels was possible and non-inferior to that with the SOFA score.
Conclusions
WRS secreted early in sepsis may be useful not only for the early detection of sepsis, but also for the prediction of mortality in critically ill patients."

to evaluate clinical characteristics, diagnostic approach and treatment outcome of tuberculosis (TB) in children living in a high burden metropolitan area.
Methods
a retrospective study, based on medical chart review, involving children under 15 years old treated for TB from 2007 to 2016, in four primary health units (PHU) and three reference centers (RC) in five cities of Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area. Factors associated with TB treatment setting, microbiological diagnosis and treatment outcome were evaluated.
Results
544 children were enrolled; 71% were treated at PHU, 36% were under 5 years old and 72% had pulmonary TB (PTB). HIV prevalence was 10% (31/322). Fifty-three percent had at least one microbiological test for TB, 68% of them (196/287) had TB confirmed. Among 222 children with previous TB contact, information on LTBI was available for 78 (35%), and only 17% (13/78) were treated. Extrapulmonary TB (56% vs. 32%), microbiological confirmed TB (77% vs. 60%) and HIV positivity (18.5% vs. 4.0%) were significantly more frequent in RC. Treatment at RC (OR = 3.08; 95% CI 1.74-5.44) and PTB (OR = 2.47; 95% CI 1.34-4.56) were independently associated with microbiological diagnosis of TB. Treatment success rate was 85%. In the logistic regression, HIV-infected children had a 2.5-fold higher risk of unfavorable outcome (OR = 2.53; 95% CI: 1.0-6.38; p = 0.05).
Conclusion
opportunities of TB prevention and early TB treatment are missed due to suboptimal close contact screening. Microbiological diagnosis of TB and susceptibility drug testing in children should be made available through more sensitive and accessible tests."

Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of China, recorded its first confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case on 23 January 2020. We reviewed the case epidemiology and the various public health measures implemented from January to May 2020.
Methods
The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the cases recorded in different phases of the epidemic were described and compared, and the effectiveness of the public health measures implemented were reviewed using the changes in the daily number of confirmed cases and the interval from symptom onset to hospital admission.
Results
Between January and May 2020, 1084 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported, about 70% of which had a history of travel during the incubation period. The case fatality ratio was 0.4%. The local epidemic progressed through four phases: (1) preparedness and imported infection from mainland China, (2) local transmission, (3) imported infection from overseas countries associated with local transmission, and (4) controlled imported infection with limited local transmission, with an eventual reduction of the daily case number and minimization of the onset-to-admission interval. Various public health measures, including enhanced surveillance, border control, and social distancing, were introduced in phases in response to the prevailing local and global situations.
Discussion
The overall containment strategy in Hong Kong led to a stabilization of the number of cases and the absence of a community-wide outbreak during the 4.5 m after the first case was reported. This strategy of containment might serve as an example for future planning of preparedness and response against novel infectious agents."

To describe the prevalence, clinical characteristics, impact of systemic steroids exposure and outcomes of delayed cerebral vasculopathy (DCV) in a cohort of adult patients with pneumococcal meningitis (PM).
Methods
Observational retrospective multicenter study including all episodes of PM from January 2002 to December 2015. DCV was defined as proven/probable/possible based upon clinical criteria and pathological-radiological findings. DCV-patients and non-DCV-patients were compared by univariate analysis.
Results
162 PM episodes were included. Seventeen (10.5%) DCV-patients were identified (15 possible, 2 probable). At admission, DCV-patients had a longer duration of symptoms (>2 days in 58% vs. 25.5% (p 0.04)), more coma (52.9% vs. 21.4% (p 0.03)), lower median CSF WBC-count (243 cells/uL vs. 2673 cells/uL (p 0.001)) and a higher proportion of positive CSF Gram stain (94.1% vs. 71% (p 0.07)).

DCV appeared 1-8 days after having completed adjunctive dexamethasone treatment (median 2,5, IQR=1.5-5).
Conclusions
One tenth of the PM developed DCV. DCV-patients had a longer duration of illness, were more severely ill, had a higher bacterial load at admission and had a more complicated course. Less than one third of cases recovered without disabilities. The role of corticosteroids in DCV remains to be established."

Although COVID-19 is known to be caused by human-to-human transmission, it remains largely unclear whether ambient air pollutants and meteorological parameters could promote its transmission.
Methods
A retrospective study was conducted to study whether air quality index (AQI), four ambient air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and CO) and five meteorological variables (daily temperature, highest temperature, lowest temperature, temperature difference and sunshine duration) could increase COVID-19 incidence in Wuhan and XiaoGan between Jan 26th to Feb 29th in 2020.
Results
First, a significant correlation was found between COVID-19 incidence and AQI in both Wuhan (R2=0.13, p<0.05) and XiaoGan (R2=0.223, p<0.01). Specifically, among four pollutants, COVID-19 incidence was prominently correlated with PM2.5 and NO2 in both cities. In Wuhan, the tightest correlation was observed between NO2 and COVID-19 incidence (R2=0.329, p<0.01). In XiaoGan, in addition to the PM2.5 (R2=0.117, p<0.01) and NO2 (R2=0.015, p<0.05), a notable correlation was also observed between the PM10 and COVID-19 incidence (R2=0.105, p<0.05). Moreover, temperature is the only meteorological parameter that constantly correlated well with COVID-19 incidence in both Wuhan and XiaoGan, but in an inverse correlation (p<0.05).
Conclusions
AQI, PM2.5, NO2, and temperature are four variables that could promote the sustained transmission of COVID-19."

the recent outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) has quickly spread globally since its discovery in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. A comprehensive strategy, including surveillance, diagnostics, research, and clinical treatment is urgently needed to win the battle against COVID-19. Recently, numerous studies reported the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic patients. Yet, the incidence and viral transmission from the asymptomatic cases are not apparent yet.
Aim
this study aims to systematically review the published literature on SARS-CoV-2 in the asymptomatic patients to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 among asymptomatic cases, as well as describe its epidemiological and clinical significance.
Method
the literature was searched through four scientific databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Science Direct.
Results
a total of 63 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria where the majority of the reported studies were from China. However, there was a lack of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological studies from several countries worldwide, tracing the actual incidence of COVID-19, especially in asymptomatic patients. Studies with a large sample size (n>1000) estimated that percentage of people contracting SARS-CoV-2 and are likely to be asymptomatic ranges from 1.2-12.9%. However, the other studies with a smaller sample size reported a much higher incidence and indicated that up to 87.9% of COVID-19 infected individuals could be asymptomatic. Most of these studies indicated that asymptopatics are a potential source of infection to the community.
Conclusion
this review highlighted the need for more robust and well-designed studies to better estimate COVID-19 incidence among asymptomatic patients worldwide. The early identification of the asymptomatic cases, as well as monitoring and tracing close contact, could help in mitigating the spread of COVID-19."

Reactive case detection (RCD) is a commonly used strategy for malaria surveillance and response in elimination settings. Many approaches to RCD assume detectable infections are clustered within and around homes of passively detected cases (index households), which has been evaluated in a number of settings with disparate results.
Methods
Household questionnaires and diagnostic testing were conducted following RCD investigations in Zanzibar, Tanzania, including the index household and up to 9 additional neighboring households.
Results
Of 12,487 participants tested by malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT), 3·2% of those residing in index households and 0·4% of those residing in non-index households tested positive (OR = 8·4; 95%CI: 5·7, 12·5). Of 6,281 participants tested by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), 8·4% of those residing in index households and 1·3% of those residing in non-index households tested positive (OR = 7·1; 95%CI: 6·1, 10·9). Within households of index cases defined as imported, odds of qPCR-positivity amongst members reporting recent travel were 1·4 times higher than among those without travel history (95%CI: 0·2, 4·4). Amongst non-index households, odds of qPCR-detectable infection were no different between households located within 50 m of the index household as compared with those located farther away (OR = 0·8, 95%CI: 0·5, 1·4). Sensitivity of RDT to detect qPCR-detectable infections was 34% (95%CI: 26·4, 42·3).
Conclusions
Malaria prevalence in index households in Zanzibar is much higher than in non-index households, in which prevalence is very low. Travelers represent a high-risk population. Low sensitivity of RDTs due to a high prevalence of low-density infections results in an RCD system missing a large proportion of the parasite reservoir."

Actions taken
The Government of Malaysia enforced a Movement Control Order starting on March 18, 2020 to break the chain of COVID-19. The media actively spread the hashtag #stayhome. Non-governmental organizations, as well as prison inmates, started to produce personal protective equipment for frontliners. Various organizations hosted fundraising events to provide essentials mainly to hospitals. A provisional hospital was set up and collaborations with healthcare service providers were granted, while additional laboratories were assigned to enhance the capabilities of the Ministry of Health.

The aim of this study was to estimate influenza-attributable years of life lost (YLL) in older adults in subtropical Hefei, China during the years 2012–2017, based on a competing risks approach.
Methods
The quasi-Poisson model was fitted to weekly numbers of all-cause deaths by 5-year age groups for older adults ≥60 years of age. The product of the weekly influenza-like illness consultation rate and the proportion of specimens that tested positive for influenza was taken as the measurement of influenza activity, which was incorporated into the model as an exploratory variable. Excess deaths associated with influenza were calculated by subtracting baseline deaths (setting influenza activity to zero) from fitted deaths. Influenza-attributable YLL accounting for competing risks was estimated using restricted mean lifetime survival analysis.
Results
The annual influenza-attributable YLL was highest in the 75–79 years age group (565 per 100,000 persons, 95% confidence interval 550–580), followed by the 80–84, 70–74, 85–89, 65–69, and 60–64 years age groups. Influenza A(H3N2) virus was associated with higher YLL than A(H1N1) and B viruses. Influenza-attributable YLL accounted for 1.03–1.53% of total YLL, and the proportion would be overestimated to 2.91–7.34% if the traditional Kaplan–Meier method ignoring competing risks was used.
Conclusions
Although influenza-associated mortality increased with age, influenza-attributable YLL was found to be highest in the 75–79 years age group."

Variations in 8,773 (25.94%) genomes were considered as high risk, whereas additional 2,854 (8.43%) genomes presented low frequent single mutations and were predicted to yield no impact on sensitivity. In case of the QIAstat-Dx SARS-CoV-2 Panel, 99.11% of the genomes matched with a 100% coverage all oligonucleotides, and critical variations were tested in vitro corroborating no loss of sensitivity.
Conclusions
This analysis stresses the importance of targeting more than one region in the viral genome for SARS-CoV-2 detection to mitigate the risk of loss of sensitivity due to the unknown mutation rate during this SARS-CoV-2 outbreak."

To examine the patterns of COVID-19 transmission in Uganda.
Methods
We reviewed ten weeks of press releases from the Uganda Ministry of Health from the day when the first case was announced, March 22, through May 29, 2020. We obtained the press releases from the MoH website and the Twitter handle (@MinofHealthUG). Data include the number of persons tested and the categories were classified as international arrivals, community members, and long-distance truck drivers.
Results
The first cases were international arrivals from Asia and Europe, and after that, community cases emerged. However, in the middle of April 2020, COVID-19 cases were detected among long-distance truck drivers. By May 29, 2020, 89, 224 persons had been tested; overall, 442 tested positive. Of those that tested positive, the majority, or 317 (71.8%) were truck drivers, 75 (16.9%) were community cases, and 50 (11.3%) were international arrivals. The majority of community cases have been linked to contact with truck drivers.
Conclusions
Truck drivers were the most frequently diagnosed category, and have become a core group for COVID-19 in Uganda. They have generated significant local transmission, which now threatens a full-blown epidemic unless strict controls are put in place."

The aim of this study is to assess how COVID-19 clustered across districts in South Korea and to assess whether the pattern and duration of clusters changed following the country’s containment strategy.
Methods
We conducted spatiotemporal analysis of COVID-19 daily confirmed cases by 250 districts in South Korea from January 20 to May 31, 2020, obtained from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and each provincial website. Global Moran’s I statistic was used for spatial autocorrelation analysis and retrospective space-time scan statistic was used to analyze spatiotemporal clusters of COVID-19.
Results
The geographical distribution showed strong spatial autocorrelation, with a global Moran’s I coefficient of 0.784 (p = 0.0001). Twelve statistically significant spatiotemporal clusters were identified by space-time scan statistic using a discrete Poisson model. The spatial pattern of clusters changed and the duration of clusters became shorter over time.
Conclusions
Results indicate that South Korea’s containment strategy of COVID-19 was highly effective in both early detection and mitigation, with recent clusters being small in size and duration. Lessons from South Korea should spark a discussion on epidemic response."

This study aimed to consider the estimated time to multi-resistant tuberculosis culture conversion, and associated factors, in order to enhance evidence utilization in eastern Africa.
Methods
We systematically identified available articles on multidrug-resistant tuberculosis culture conversion using PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Web of Science core collection, and Science Direct databases. A random-effects model was employed using the R 3.6.1 version and Stata/se 14 software.
Results
Nine articles with a sample size of 2458 multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients were included. The two-month culture conversion rate was 75.4%, with a median time of 61.2 days (interquartile range: 48.6-73.8). In the included studies, favorable treatment outcomes of MDR-TB patients were seen in 75% of the cases, while unfavorable treatment outcomes were seen in 18% (10% deaths, 7% defaulted, and 1% treatment failure) of the cases. The independent factor for delayed sputum culture conversion was body mass index below 18.5kg/m2 (HR=3.1, 95% CI: 2.0, 6.7).
Conclusion
The median time to sputum culture conversion was 61.2 days, which is a reasonably short time. Body mass index was the identified associated factor leading to delayed culture conversion. Therefore, there is a need for awareness of how to improve the nutritional status of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients through appropriate nutritional supports."

Dengue and Zika infections cause illnesses with overlapping clinical manifestations. We aimed to explore the association of each of these infections with single or grouped clinical and laboratory parameters.
Methods
We prospectively collected clinical and laboratory data from a cohort of patients seeking care for symptoms meeting the Pan American Health Organization’s modified case-definition criteria for probable Zika virus infection. Zika and dengue were diagnosed with RT-PCR. We examined the relationship of clinical characteristics and laboratory data with Zika, dengue and undefined acute illness (UAI).
Results
In univariate models, localized rash and maculopapular exanthema were associated with Zika infection. Generalized rash, petechia, and petechial purpuric rash were associated with dengue. Cough and confusion/disorientation were associated with UAI. Platelets were significantly lower in the dengue group. A conditional inference tree model showed poor sensitivity and positive predictive value for individual viral diagnoses.
Conclusions
Clusters of signs, symptoms and laboratory values evaluated in this study cannot consistently differentiate Zika or dengue cases from UAI in the clinical setting at the individual patient level. We identified symptoms that are important to Zika and dengue in univariate analyses, but predictive models were unreliable. Low platelet count was a distinctive feature of dengue. This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02831699)."

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a major pandemic threat that has spread to more than 212 countries with more than 432,902 recorded deaths and 7,898,442 confirmed cases worldwide so far (on June 14, 2020). It is crucial to investigate the spatial drivers to prevent and control the epidemic of COVID-19.
Methods
This is the first comprehensive study of COVID-19 in Iran; and it carries out spatial modeling, risk mapping, change detection, and outbreak trend analysis of the disease spread. Four main steps were taken: comparison of Iranian coronavirus data with the global trends, prediction of mortality trends using regression modeling, spatial modeling, risk mapping, and change detection using the random forest (RF) machine learning technique (MLT), and validation of the modeled risk map.
Results
The results show that from February 19 to June 14, 2020, the average growth rates (GR) of COVID-19 deaths and the total number of COVID-19 cases in Iran were 1.08 and 1.10, respectively. Based on the World Health Organisation (WHO) data, Iran’s fatality rate (deaths/0.1M pop) is 10.53. Other countries’ fatality rates were, for comparison, Belgium – 83.32, UK – 61.39, Spain – 58.04, Italy – 56.73, Sweden – 48.28, France – 45.04, USA – 35.52, Canada – 21.49, Brazil – 20.10, Peru – 19.70, Chile – 16.20, Mexico– 12.80, and Germany – 10.58. The fatality rate for China is 0.32 (deaths/0.1M pop). Over time, the heatmap of the infected areas identified two critical time intervals for the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran. The provinces were classified in terms of disease and death rates into a large primary group and three provinces that had critical outbreaks were separate from the others. The heatmap of countries of the world shows that China and Italy were distinguished from other countries in terms of nine viral infection-related parameters. The regression models for death cases showed an increasing trend but with some evidence of turning. A polynomial relationship was identified between the coronavirus infection rate and the province population density. Also, a third-degree polynomial regression model for deaths showed an increasing trend recently, indicating that subsequent measures taken to cope with the outbreak have been insufficient and ineffective. The general trend of deaths in Iran is similar to the world's, but Iran’s shows lower volatility. Change detection of COVID-19 risk maps with a random forest model for the period from March 11 to March 18 showed an increasing trend of COVID-19 in Iran’s provinces. It is worth noting that using the LASSO MLT to evaluate variables’ importance, indicated that the most important variables were the distance from bus stations, bakeries, hospitals, mosques, ATMs (automated teller machines), banks, and the minimum temperature of the coldest month.
Conclusions
We believe that this study's risk maps are the primary, fundamental step to take for managing and controlling COVID-19 in Iran and its provinces."

This retrospective analysis performed in Manhiça, Southern Mozambique, aimed to describe the frequency of post-malarial anemia (measured as a decrease of hematocrit ≥10%) and the need for blood transfusions in children with severe malaria treated with intravenous quinine or parenteral artesunate.
Methods
All children <15 years admitted with a parasitologically-confirmed diagnosis of malaria from 1st January 2003 to 31st December 2017, alive at hospital discharge, and with at least one measurement of hematocrit within 28 days after hospital discharge, detected by passive case detection, were included.
Results
The overall prevalence of post-malarial anemia observed in the study was 23.13%, with an estimated incidence rate of 288.84 episodes/1,000 children-month at risk in the follow-up period (28 days after discharge). There were no differences between treatment groups, although the study showed a higher association between blood transfusions and artesunate treatment.
Conclusions
In this setting, children with severe malaria frequently present a meaningful decrease of hematocrit (>=10%) in the first weeks after their episode, sometimes requiring blood transfusions. Because of the high underlying prevalence of anemia in malaria-endemic settings, all children with severe malaria need to be actively followed up, irrespective of the treatment received."

abstract = "Background
Sepsis causes varying degrees of thrombocytopenia that are closely related to the likelihood of patient mortality. This study analysed the effect of recombinant human thrombopoietin (rhTPO) on the platelet count in critically ill patients with sepsis-associated thrombocytopenia and provided a reference for its treatment.
Material/methods
The study was a retrospective analysis of the clinical data of patients. Patients were divided into an rhTPO group and control group according to rhTPO use during treatment. Demographical and clinical data (age, sex, history of hypertension, diabetes, platelet counts, mortality rate, etc.) of the patients were collected and analysed using statistical software; p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Of 213 patients, 84 constituted the rhTPO group and 129 constituted the control group. The increase in platelet counts was significantly higher in the rhTPO group than in the control group on the third day (43.01 ± 18.23 × 109/L vs. 36.31 ± 14.17 × 109/L, p = 0.003), fifth day (71.51 ± 39.59 × 109/L vs. 42.95 ± 20.48 × 109/L, p < 0.001) and seventh day (115.36 ± 69.41 × 109/L vs. 62.54 ± 42.70 × 109/L, p < 0.001). Further statistical analysis of the data of patients with platelet counts ≤30 × 109/L and >30 × 109/L and APACHE II scores >15 and ≤15 at the time of diagnosis showed that the increase in platelet counts in the rhTPO group was greater. There was no significant between-group difference in volume of platelet transfusions (rhTPO group 15.42 ± 17.20 vs. control group 10.93 ± 17.48, p = 0.068). The cost of ICU treatment in patients with rhTPO was higher (RMB 126,936.21 ± 86,548.27 vs. 101,685.28 ± 77,291.75, p = 0.027); however, the ICU stay time was shorter (9.20 ± 5.38 vs. 10.88 ± 6.82, p = 0.047). There was no significant difference in 28-day mortality (rhTPO group: 25.0% vs. control group: 34.1%, p = 0.158) between the two groups.
Conclusion
For patients with severe thrombocytopenia or severe sepsis, rhTPO was efficacious in increasing their platelet counts, resulting in a shorter ICU stay time."

abstract = "Background
Vertical transmission is the predominant route for acquisition of HIV infection in children, either in utero, intrapartum or postnatally through breast feeding. Less frequently, children may acquire HIV by horizontal transmission. Horizontal transmission may be healthcare-associated (infusion of HIV-contaminated blood products, use of contaminated needles, syringes and medical equipment, or through ingestion of HIV in expressed breastmilk). Community-acquired HIV transmission to children may occur following surrogate breastfeeding, pre-mastication of food, and sexual abuse.
Methods
Children with suspected horizontally-acquired HIV infection were identified by retrospective folder review of existing patients (2004-2014) and by prospective interview and examination of new patients (from 2009 onwards), at a hospital-based paediatric antiretroviral clinic in Cape Town, South Africa. The global literature on horizontal HIV transmission to children (1 January 1986 - 1 November 2019) was reviewed, to contextualize the local findings.
Results
Among the 32 children with horizontal HIV transmission (15 identified retrospectively and 17 prospectively), the median age at first diagnosis was 79 months (interquartile range 28·5 – 91·5); most children (90·6%) had advanced HIV disease at presentation. HIV transmission was considered healthcare-associated in 15 (46·9%), community-associated in ten (31·3%), possibly healthcare or community-associated in five (15·6 %); and unknown in two children (6·3%).
Conclusion
Horizontal HIV transmission to children is an important public health issue, with prevention efforts requiring intervention at healthcare facility- and community-level. Greater effort should be made to promptly identify and comprehensively investigate each horizontally HIV-infected child to establish possible routes of transmission and inform future prevention strategies."

Amid the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis, South Korea has been lauded for successfully preventing the spread of this infectious disease, which may be due to the aggressive implementation of preventive policies. This study was performed to evaluate the pattern of spread of COVID-19 in South Korea considering the potential impact of policy interventions on transmission rates.
Methods
A SIR (susceptible–infected–removed) model with a breakpoint that allows a change in transmission rate at an unknown point was established. Estimated trajectories of COVID-19 from SIR models with and without a breakpoint were compared.
Results
The proposed model with a break fitted the actual series of infection cases much better than the classic model. The estimated breakpoint was March 7, 2020 and the transmission rate dropped by 0.23 after the breakpoint. A counterfactual study based on our estimate indicated that the number of infected could have reached 2 500 000 compared to the peak of 8000 in the observed series.
Conclusions
It is critical to consider a change in the transmission rate to evaluate the trajectory of spread of COVID-19 in South Korea. Our estimation and counterfactual experiments indicate that public health interventions may play a role in determining the pattern of spread of infectious diseases."

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) share a complex bidirectional relationship, however, population prevalence and the association between the presence of STIs and HIV in a high HIV burden district in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa is not known.
Methods
A total of 9812 participants aged 15–49 years were enrolled in a cross-sectional population-based household survey. Participants completed a structured questionnaire and provided first-pass urine (males) or self-collected vulvo-vaginal swabs (females) for the detection of STIs.
Results
Prevalence of herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2) was 57.8%, syphilis was 1.6%, Neisseria gonorrhoeae was 2.8%, Chlamydia trachomatis was 7.1%, Trichomonas vaginalis was 9.0%, Mycoplasma genitalium was 5.5% and HIV was 36.3%.

The United States is in an acceleration phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently there is no known effective therapy or vaccine for treatment of SARS-CoV-2, highlighting urgency around identifying effective therapies.
Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of hydroxychloroquine therapy alone and in combination with azithromycin in hospitalized patients positive for COVID-19.
Design
Multi-center retrospective observational study.
Setting
The Henry Ford Health System (HFHS) in Southeast Michigan: large six hospital integrated health system; the largest of hospitals is an 802-bed quaternary academic teaching hospital in urban Detroit, Michigan.
Participants
Consecutive patients hospitalized with a COVID-related admission in the health system from March 10, 2020 to May 2, 2020 were included. Only the first admission was included for patients with multiple admissions. All patients evaluated were 18 years of age and older and were treated as inpatients for at least 48h unless expired within 24h.
Exposure
Receipt of hydroxychloroquine alone, hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin, azithromycin alone, or neither.
Main outcome
The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality.
Results
Of 2,541 patients, with a median total hospitalization time of 6 days (IQR: 4–10 days), median age was 64 years (IQR:53–76 years), 51% male, 56% African American, with median time to follow-up of 28.5 days (IQR:3–53). Overall in-hospital mortality was 18.1% (95% CI:16.6%–19.7%); by treatment: hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin, 157/783 (20.1% [95% CI: 17.3%–23.0%]), hydroxychloroquine alone, 162/1202 (13.5% [95% CI: 11.6%–15.5%]), azithromycin alone, 33/147 (22.4% [95% CI: 16.0%–30.1%]), and neither drug, 108/409 (26.4% [95% CI: 22.2%–31.0%]). Primary cause of mortality was respiratory failure (88%); no patient had documented torsades de pointes. From Cox regression modeling, predictors of mortality were age>65 years (HR:2.6 [95% CI:1.9–3.3]), white race (HR:1.7 [95% CI:1.4–2.1]), CKD (HR:1.7 [95%CI:1.4–2.1]), reduced O2 saturation level on admission (HR:1.5 [95%CI:1.1–2.1]), and ventilator use during admission (HR: 2.2 [95%CI:1.4–3.3]). Hydroxychloroquine provided a 66% hazard ratio reduction, and hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin 71% compared to neither treatment (p<0.001).
Conclusions and relevance
In this multi-hospital assessment, when controlling for COVID-19 risk factors, treatment with hydroxychloroquine alone and in combination with azithromycin was associated with reduction in COVID-19 associated mortality. Prospective trials are needed to examine this impact."

abstract = "Objectives
In Sierra Leone, very little data are available on hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence. Blood donor screening permits estimation of the prevalence of transfusion transmissible infections in a general open population. We analyzed blood donor data in Sierra Leone to estimate national viral hepatitis prevalence and identify risk factors for hepatitis infection among the donor population.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective data analysis in five government hospitals. We collected HBV and HCV screening results, donor demographics, and donation type (family replacement or voluntary donor; first-time or repeat). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine associations between infections and socio-demographic factors.
Results
The number of donors screened was 29,713. The overall prevalence was: 10.8% (3200) for HBV and 1.2% (357) for HCV. HBV infection was strongest associated with male sex (p: <0.0001) and younger age (p: <0.0004 for the 22-27 age group). Both HBV and HCV infection were higher in certain locations.
Conclusion
Our findings stress the presence of viral hepatitis infection throughout the country and the need to invest in safe blood services, vaccination and treatment of viral hepatitis at national level."

Characteristics of the Mycobacterium avium–intracellulare complex pulmonary disease (MAC-PD) caused by distinct subspecies remain uncertain.
Methods
This study was conducted from 2013–2015 in three hospitals in Taiwan.
Results
Among the 144 patients with MAC-PD, 57 (39.6%), 37 (25.7%), 37 (25.7%), and 13 (9.0%) were infected with Mycobacterium intracellulare subspecies intracellulare (MIsI), Mycobacterium avium subspecies hominissuis (MAsH), Mycobacterium intracellulare subspecies chimaera (MIsC), and others, respectively. Patients with MAsH-PD were younger (p = 0.010) with higher human immunodeficiency virus infection rates (27.0%, 0.0%, 0.0%, and 7.7% for MAsH-PD, MIsC-PD, MIsI-PD, and others, respectively; p < 0.001). Twenty-two (15.3%) patients reported spontaneous culture-negative conversion, but 15 (10.4%) and 33 (22.9%) patients developed radiographic progression and unfavorable outcomes, especially MAsH-PD. The susceptibility rates to clarithromycin and inhaled amikacin were both 98.6%. MAsH demonstrated the lowest rate of resistance to moxifloxacin (66.7%, 97.3%, 89.1%, and 92.3% for MAsH-PD, MIsC-PD, MIsI-PD, and others, respectively; p = 0.001) and MIsI isolates had the highest rate of resistance to intravenous amikacin (25%, 13.5%, 38.2%, and 15.4% for MAsH-PD, MIsC-PD, MIsI-PD, and others, respectively; p = 0.024).
Conclusions
Pulmonary disease caused by distinct MAC subspecies had different outcomes and drug susceptibility. The local prevalence of species needs to be monitored."

The goal of this study was to describe and assess demographic and clinical parameters of women who had infants with stigmata of Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) versus those who had normal appearing infants at birth. Providing further details on the clinical caveats of neonatal ZIKV infection.
Methodology
This cross-sectional study was performed in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Central-West region of Brazil and included 117 mothers-infant pairs who were interviewed (all mothers had laboratory confirmation by qRT-PCR of ZIKV infection during pregnancy) and 120 gestational outcomes.
Results
The prevalence of congenital abnormalities related to ZIKV was 2.69 cases per 10,000 live births during this period. Exanthem was the main clinical finding observed in 92.5% of the mothers in this study. Regarding timing of ZIKV infection, the first trimester was the most frequent time of infection among mothers of infants with CZS (54.55%) (p = 0.0007). The case fatality rate was 5% (n = 6). Among all 23 children who were classified as having CZS, 13 (56.52%) of them presented with microcephaly. Only 13 (56.52%) of children with CZS were tested by qRT-PCR for ZIKV infection at birth, five (38%) were positive.
Conclusions
This study highlights the congenital alterations of ZIKV infection during pregnancy in an epidemic burst, demonstrating that the alterations found in other studies are similar to the present research."

Aimed at mitigating influenza transmission, this study assessed the timing of the vaccination program and took vaccine capacity, strain mismatch and priority group into consideration.
Methods
An age-structured dynamic transmission model was fitted to the laboratory data of the national influenza surveillance system to reconstruct a baseline scenario with which the vaccination scenarios of interest could be compared. Outcome measures were defined as the impacts on the seasonal epidemic: decompression of the epidemic peak, reduction of the epidemic burden and change of the epidemic peak time.
Results
It was found that vaccine capacity building, although indispensable, could not guarantee substantial impact on the seasonal influenza epidemic. Vaccine mismatch might greatly offset vaccine capacity building. Notably, advance vaccine distribution could compensate for some vaccine underperformance. In the case of a well-matched vaccine, advance vaccine distribution could even exploit its utility.
Conclusions
This study indicated that timely vaccine distribution should be put high on the agenda of seasonal influenza control policies. It provided a tangible platform for the policymakers to evaluate health policy impacts and to enhance risk communication with the public through mathematical modeling."

To assess the relevance of urine test (UT), urine culture (UC) and stone culture (SC) for postoperative infections and to investigate the optimal perioperative antibiotic treatment strategy in association with percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) in patients with renal calculi.
Materials and methods
Between September 2016 and September 2018 1,060 patients treated with PCNL were included in the study. The results of UT, UC and SC were reviewed. The details of perioperatively administered antibiotics and postoperative infections were recorded.
Results
A positive UT was associated with an increased incidence of infection; this was also the case in patients with negative UC (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in incidence of infection between patients who were given a single dose of antibiotics compared with those given multiple doses when UC was negative, whether UT was positive or negative (all p > 0.05). The incidence of infection was decreased when pre-operative antibiotics were administered according to the sensitivity pattern based on UC (p < 0.05). This outcome was particularly evident when the treatment duration exceeded 7 days (p < 0.05). A positive SC was associated with increased incidence of infection, even if the patient had a negative UC and UT (p < 0.05). The incidence of infection was significantly decreased when antibiotic treatment was administered based on the results of SC (p < 0.05).
Conclusion
Pre-operative prophylaxis with a single-dose antibiotic was sufficient in patients with negative UC, whether UT was positive or negative. Pre-operative treatment with antibiotics according to the bacterial sensitivity pattern should be administered for ≥7 days in patients with positive UC. The postoperative antibiotic treatment strategy should be tailored according to the SC results."

Taeniasis caused by two major Taenia species, T. solium and T. saginata is a food borne zoonotic disease of man worldwide. Whereas T. solium is found in people habitual of eating raw or undercooked pork, while as T. saginata is the parasite of beef eating populations and the route of transmission is via consumption of undercooked or raw beef. The cattle rearing and beef consumption is an important socio-cultural feature in Kashmir valley, India. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of food borne taeniasis in Kashmir and to explore the various risk factors for its transmission.
Methods & Materials
A detailed survey of human population in some selected rural and semi-urban sites of Kashmir valley was carried out based on previous information. A total of 12,404 subjects (males = 6364; females = 6040) ranging from 1 to 85 years of age (mean age: 28.96 ± 17.68) were included in this study. The diagnosis of the parasite was made through stool analysis (egg morphology) and anatomical characteristics of gravid proglottids obtained from infected cases. The data obtained was compiled with respect to parameters studied and statistically analyzed.
Results
The observations as estimated coprologically and on the basis of anatomy of gravid proglottids revealed presence of T. saginata infection. The prevalence was 2.74% with males significantly (p < 0.01) more infected (3.40 %) than females (2.05%). Similarly, the age group of > 60 years showed greater prevalence (7.21% among males and 2.68% among females) at a significance value of p < 0.05. The rural population was slightly more infected (2.84%) than semi-urban populations (2.36%) with a statistically significant difference (p < 0.01).
Conclusion
Our findings indicate that Kashmiri population who consume raw or undercooked beef harbor T. saginata infection and its prevalence was influenced by food eating habit, age, sex and living conditions of the population."

A standard treatment regimen against Mycobacteroides abscessus complex (MABC) infections has not yet been established, making MABC difficult to treat successfully. In this study, we sought to develop an active ingredient for the clinical treatment of MABC infections.
Methods
We screened 102 MABC strains isolated from clinical specimens using DNA sequence analysis with the housekeeping genes hsp65 and rpoB. Drug susceptibility testing was performed against two subspecies—Mycobacteroides abscessus subsp. abscessus (M. abscessus) and Mycobacteroides abscessus subsp. massiliense (M. massiliense)—using eight antimicrobial agents (clarithromycin, amikacin, doxycycline, imipenem, linezolid, moxifloxacin, faropenem, and rifampicin). The combined efficacy of the antimicrobial agents was investigated using a checkerboard method.
Results
We identified 51 isolates as M. abscessus, 46 as M. massiliense, and five as others. Most of the M. abscessus isolates (83.0 %) exhibited inducible resistance to clarithromycin via the expression of the erm(41) gene. Combinations of imipenem with linezolid, moxifloxacin, and rifampicin exhibited additive effects against 81.0 %, 40.7 %, and 26.9 % of M. abscessus, respectively, and against 54.5 %, 69.2 %, and 30.8 % of M. massiliense, respectively.

Clinical characteristics and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained from 86 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Guangzhou Eighth People’s Hospital. Chronological analysis method was used to detailly clarify the neurosensory dysfunction. The cycle threshold (Ct) values were used to approximately indicate viral load.
Results
Forth-four (51.2%) patients had neurosensory dysfunction: hyposmia (34, 39.5%), hypogeusia (33, 38.4%), and tinnitus (3, 3.5%). Neurosensory dysfunction was significantly more common in patients under 40 years old (p = 0.001) or women (p = 0.006). Hyposmia and hypogeusia coexisted in 23 (26.7%) patients. The interval between onset of hyposmia and hypogeusia was 0.7 ± 1.46 days. The interval from onset of hyposmia and hypogeusia to typical symptoms was 0.22 ± 4.57 and 0.75 ± 6.77 days; the interval from onset of hyposmia and hypogeusia to admission was 6.06 ± 6.68 and 5.76 ± 7.68 days; and the duration of hyposmia and hypogeusia was 9.09 ± 5.74 and 7.12 ± 4.66 days, respectively. The viral load was high since symptoms onset, peaked within the first week, and then gradually declined.

Despite effective antibiotics and vaccines, bacterial meningitis (BM) remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in young infants worldwide. Data from Africa on the aetiology and antibiotic susceptibility are scarce.
Objective
To describe the aetiology of BM in Angolan infants <90 days of age.
Methods
A prospective, observational, single-site study was conducted from February 2016 to October 2017 in the Paediatric Hospital of Luanda. All cerebrospinal fluid samples (CSF) from infants aged <90 days with suspected BM or neonatal sepsis were assessed. The local laboratory performed microscopy, chemistry, culture, and susceptibility testing. PCR for vaccine-preventable pathogens was performed in Johannesburg, South Africa.
Results
Of the 1287 infants, 299 (23%) had confirmed or probable BM. Of the 212 (16%) identified bacterial isolates from CSF, the most common were Klebsiella spp (30 cases), Streptococcus pneumoniae (29 cases), Streptococcus agalactiae (20 cases), Escherichia coli (17 cases), and Staphylococcus aureus (11 cases). A fifth of pneumococci (3/14; 21%) showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin, whereas methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was encountered in 4/11 cases (36%). Of the gram-negative isolates, 6/45 (13%) were resistant to gentamicin and 20/58 (34%) were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins. Twenty-four percent (33/135) of the BM cases were fatal, but this is likely an underestimation.
Conclusions
BM was common among infants <90 days of age in Luanda. Gram-negative bacteria were predominant and were often resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Continued surveillance of the antibiogram is pivotal to detect potential changes without delay."

Elderly people had suffered a disproportionate burden of COVID-19. We hypothesized that males and females in different age groups might have different epidemic trajectories.
Methods
Using publicly available data from South Korea, daily new COVID-19 cases were assessed using generalized additive models, assuming Poisson and negative binomial distributions. Epidemic dynamics by age and gender groups were explored using interactions between smoothed time terms and age and gender.
Results
A negative binomial distribution fitted the daily case counts best. The relationship between the dynamic patterns of daily new cases and age groups was statistically significant (p<0.001), but this was not the case with gender groups. People aged 20–39 years led the epidemic processes in South Korean society with two peaks — one major peak around March 1 and a smaller peak around April 7, 2020. The epidemic process among people aged 60 or above trailed behind that of the younger age group, and with smaller magnitude. After March 15, there was a consistent decline of daily new cases among elderly people, despite large fluctuations in case counts among young adults.
Conclusions
Although young people drove the COVID-19 epidemic throughout society, with multiple rebounds, elderly people could still be protected from infection after the peak of the epidemic."

Multiple diagnostic methods were employed to diagnose atypical infections including culture, serology, and urinary antigen.
Results
The microbiological intent-to-treat (MITT) population included 520 patients; 30% had an atypical bacterial pathogen identified (156/520). Overall, 13.1% (68/520) had a monomicrobial atypical infection and 2.3% (12/520) had polymicrobial all-atypical infections. Among patients with polymicrobial infections, Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequently occurring co-infecting organism and Chlamydia pneumoniae was the most frequently occurring co-infecting atypical organism. For Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila, serology yielded the highest number of diagnoses. Delafloxacin and moxifloxacin had similar in vitro activity against M. pneumoniae and delafloxacin had greater activity against L. pneumophila. Two macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae isolates were recovered. No fluoroquinolone-resistant M. pneumoniae were isolated. The rates of microbiological success (documented or presumed eradication) at test-of-cure were similar between the delafloxacin and moxifloxacin groups. There was no evidence of a correlation between minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and outcome; a high proportion of favorable outcomes was observed across all delafloxacin baseline MICs.
Conclusions
Delafloxacin may be considered a treatment option as monotherapy for CABP in adults, where broad-spectrum coverage including atypical activity is desirable."

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a progressive disease that, left untreated, is typically fatal. The purpose of this investigation was to detectLeishmania sp. infection in hemodialysis patients who had received multiple blood transfusions at a private clinic in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul state, Midwest Brazil.
Methods
Fifty randomly selected volunteers were interviewed for collection of demographic, socioeconomic, and epidemiological data. Indirect immunofluorescence (titers positive when ≥1:40) and rK39 immunochromatographic tests were employed for serological investigation.
Results
Males predominated (60%). Age ranged from 20 to 77 years. Most subjects reported being on hemodialysis for at least one year (94%) and 84% were candidates for kidney transplantation, 67% of whom were on the waiting list. Leishmania sp. infection was detected in 32%. Contact with infected dogs was the only variable associated with infection.
Conclusions
Under immunocompromised conditions, VL is opportunistic and potentially fatal. Despite existing risks, screening for VL is not performed in asymptomatic donors and recipients. The detection of anti-Leishmania antibodies in these patients reinforces the need for infection screening before immunosuppressive treatment is initiated to reduce not only the risks of VL development and severity, but also mortality rates in cases of reactivation of latent infection."

abstract = "Objectives
The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) originating from Wuhan spread rapidly throughout China. While its origin remains uncertain, accumulating evidence links a wet market with the early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan. Similarly, the influence of the marketplace on the early transmission dynamics is yet to be investigated.
Methods
Using the daily series of COVID-19 incidence, stratified according to contact history with the market, we have conducted quantitative modeling analyses to estimate the reproduction numbers (R) for market-to-human and human-to-human transmission, the reporting probability, and the early effects of public health interventions.
Results
We estimated R at 0.24 (95% CrI: 0.01–1.38) for market-to-human transmission and 2.37 (95% CrI: 2.08–2.71) for human-to-human transmission during the early spread in China (2019–2020). Moreover, we estimated that the reporting rate for cases stemming from market-to-human transmission was 2–34 fold higher than that for cases stemming from human-to-human transmission, suggesting that contact history with the wet market played a key role in identifying COVID-19 cases.
Conclusions
Our R estimate tied to market-to-human transmission had substantial uncertainty, but it was significantly lower compared with the reproduction number driving human-to-human transmission. Our results also suggest that asymptomatic and subclinical infections constitute a substantial component of the COVID-19 morbidity burden."

abstract = "Objectives
In Korea, the National Immunization Program provided trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV3) to all children aged 6 – 59 months during the 2017-2018 season. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of IIV3 in children during the 2017-2018 season.
Methods
Children aged 6 -59 months who were tested for influenza for their acute respiratory illness were included in four hospitals during the 2017-2018 influenza season. We estimated the VE of IIV3 by test-negative case-control design based on the rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT) or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results.
Results
A total of 4,738 children were included in this study. The number of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases was 845 (17.8%), and there were 478 cases of influenza A, 362 cases of influenza B. The adjusted VE based on RT-PCR was 53.4% (95% CI, 25.3-70.5) against any influenza, 68.8% (95% CI, 38.7-84.1) against influenza A, and 29.7% (95% CI, -35.1-61.8) for influenza B. The adjusted VE based on RIDT was 14.8% (95% CI, -4.4-30.0) against any influenza, 24.2% (95% CI, 3.1-40.2) against influenza A, and -5.1% (95% CI, -42.6-21.4) against influenza B. Age-specific VE based on RT-PCR against any influenza was 44.1% (95% CI, -0.2-67.8) in children aged 6 months to 2 years and 59.3% (95% CI, 8.8-81.9) in children aged 3 to 5 years.
Conclusion
Our results suggest moderate protection (53.4%) of IIV3 against RT-PCR laboratory-confirmed influenza in children in the 2017-2018 influenza season. However, the RIDT hampered the validity to assess VE during influenza season. Caution is needed when interpreting RIDT-based test negative design influenza VE study."

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious and contagious disease that is very influential in human history and presents high rates of mortality. The objective of this study was to investigate the association ofVDR, IL10 and SLC11A1 gene polymorphisms with susceptibility to presence of tuberculosis infection.
Methods
A total of 135 patients with confirmed tuberculosis and 141 healthy individuals were analyzed. Blood samples were collected for DNA extraction. Genotyping of the polymorphisms in VDR and IL10 genes was performed with real-time PCR and, in SLC11A1 gene, with conventional PCR followed by visualization in polyacrylamide gel. Genomic ancestry was obtained by an autosomal panel with 48 insertion/deletion ancestry informative markers.
Results
Polymorphisms TaqI (TT, p = 0.004), FokI (CC and CC + CT, p = 0.012 and p = 0.003, respectively), and BsmI (GG, p = 0.008) in VDR gene, as well as A-592C ( GC + AG, p = 0.001) in IL10 gene, were significantly associated to TB susceptibility. In addition, high production of VDR combined with low production of IL10 showed protection for TB group (p = 0.035).
Conclusions
The VDR polymorphisms may confer an increased risk and the IL10 haplotype may be a protection factor to presence of tuberculosis infection in the Brazilian population."

Prompt understanding of the temporal and spatial patterns of the COVID-19 pandemic on a national level is a critical step for the timely allocation of surveillance resources. Therefore, this study explored the temporal and spatiotemporal dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Kuwait using daily confirmed case data collected between the 23 February and 07 May 2020.
Methods
The pandemic progression was quantified using the time-dependent reproductive number (R(t)). The spatiotemporal scan statistic model was used to identify local clustering events. Variability in transmission dynamics was accounted for within and between two socioeconomic classes: citizens-residents and migrant workers.
Results
The pandemic size in Kuwait continues to grow (R(t)s ≥2), indicating significant ongoing spread. Significant spreading and clustering events were detected among migrant workers, due to their densely populated areas and poor living conditions. However, the government's aggressive intervention measures have substantially lowered pandemic growth in migrant worker areas. However, at a later stage of the study period, active spreading and clustering events among both socioeconomic classes were found.
Conclusions
This study provided deeper insights into the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Kuwait and provided an important platform for rapid guidance of decisions related to intervention activities."

Understanding the nature of Mycobacterium leprae transmission is vital to implement better control strategies for leprosy elimination. The present study expands the knowledge of county-level strain diversity, distribution, and transmission patterns of leprosy in endemic provinces of China.
Methods
We genetically characterized 290 clinical isolates of M. leprae from four endemic provinces using variable number tandem repeats (VNTR) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Attained genetic profiles and cluster consequences were contrasted with geographical and migration features of leprosy at county levels.
Results
Considering the allelic variability of 17 VNTR loci by the discriminatory index, (GTA)9, (AT)17, (AT)15, (TA)18, (TTC)21, and (TA)10 are reported to be more highly polymorphic than other loci. The VNTR profile generated the low-density clustering pattern in the counties of Sichuan and Yunnan, whereas clusters have been observed from the isolates from Huayuan (N = 6), Yongding (N = 3), Zixing (N = 3), Chenxi (N = 2) and Zhongfang (N = 2) counties of Hunan, and Zhijin (N = 3), Anlong (N = 2), Zhenning (N = 2), and Xixiu (N = 2) counties of Guizhou. In some clusters, people’s social relations have been observed between villages. From the 290 clinical isolates, the most predominantly reported SNP was 3K (278, 95.8%), followed by SNP 1D (10, 3.4%), which are typically observed to be predominant in China. We also detected the novel SNP 3J (2, 0.8%), which has not yet been reported in China.
Conclusion
The clustering pattern of M. leprae indicates the transmission of leprosy still persists at county levels, suggesting that there is a need to implement better approaches for tracing the close contacts of leprosy patients."

To explore the molecular genetic mechanisms underlying different responsiveness to Enterovirus 71 (EV71) vaccine.
Methods
We recruited 10,245 healthy children into a phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of EV71 vaccine in 2012. Fifty subjects from the trial were divided into the potent immune response group (20 subjects) and the ineffective immune response group (30 subjects). Whole-exome sequencing was performed for these 50 samples and we conducted bioinformatics analyses based on online public database.
Results
A total of 222,180 germline variants were detected across 50 subjects. Single nucleotide variant (SNV)-based screening of the subjects with potent or ineffective immune response allowed the identification of a potentially detrimental heterozygous missense variant (c.3784C>T) in EEA1. We also retained TRIM59 and ABCA7 genes that contain different loss of function (LoF) variants shared in two cases and involved in the immune response process. Then, we conducted high-resolution typing of 9 classical HLA genes, HLA-DRB1*03:01, HLA-DQA1*05:01 and HLA-DQB1*02:01 alleles were frequently (recurrence ≥5) observed only in ineffective immune responders.

We proposed mathematical model to estimate the R0 of COVID-19 in the outbreak occurring in both of local and international clusters in light of published data. Different types of clusters (religious, wedding, and industrial activity) were selected based on reported events in different countries between February and April 2020.
Results
The highest R0 values were found in wedding party events (5), followed by religious gathering events (2.5), while the lowest value was found in the industrial cluster (2). This in return, shall enable us to assess the trend coronavirus spread by comparing the model results and observed patterns..

Streptococcus pneumoniae remains a major contributor to childhood infections and deaths globally. In Cameroon, the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was introduced in July 2011, using a 3-dose Expanded programme on immunization (EPI) schedule administered to infants at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age. To evaluate PCV13 effects, we assessed pneumococcal nasopharyngeal colonization and serotype distribution among Cameroonian children after PCV13 introduction.
Methods
Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were collected from eligible children aged 24–36 months in two cross-sectional surveys conducted from March to July: in 2013 (PCV13-unvaccinated), and in 2015 (PCV13-vaccinated). Using a systematic World Health Organization (WHO) cluster coverage sampling technique in 40 communities, NP swabs collected were processed following WHO recommendations. Standard bacterial culture techniques were used for the isolation of S. pneumoniae from gentamicin-blood agar plates and identification using optochin susceptibility testing. Serotyping was performed using sequential multiplex polymerase chain reaction, supplemented with Quellung test.
Results
Among the PCV13-vaccinated children, overall pneumococcal carriage prevalence was 61.8% (426/689) and PCV13 vaccine-type carriage prevalence was 18.0% (123/689). Eleven out of the 13 vaccine serotypes were detected in the vaccinated children. The most common serotypes were 19F (4.5%, 31/689) and 15B/C (7.3%, 50/689).
Conclusion
In Cameroon, four years after infant vaccination nearly all of the PCV13-serotypes continued to circulate in the population. This suggests that the direct and indirect effects of the vaccination programme have not resulted in expected low levels of vaccine-type transmission. Continuous monitoring is needed to assess the long term effects of the PCV13 on nasopharyngeal carriage and disease."

The infected patients presented with fever, respiratory symptoms, sometimes with digestive and other systemic manifestations, and some progressed with a severe acute respiratory syndrome or even death. Associated digestive symptoms were frequently observed in the patients, with an unknown significance and mechanism. ACE2, as the major known functional receptor of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) attracted our attention. We collected the clinical data of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients from published studies and extracted the data about the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Furthermore, we used online datasets to analyze ACE2 expression in different human organs, especially in the small intestine, to explore the relationship between ACE2 expression patterns and clinical symptoms. We found that diarrhea accounted for a notable proportion of COVID-19 patients, ranging from 8.0% to 12.9%. The results reveal that ACE2 mRNA and protein are highly expressed in the small intestinal enterocytes but not in the goblet cells or intestinal immune cells. High expression of ACE2 on the surface cells in the digestive tract may lead to gastrointestinal symptoms and inflammation susceptibility. Overall, digestive symptoms were common in the COVID-19 patients. ACE2 expression on surface cells of the small intestine may mediate the invasion and amplification of the virus and activation of gastrointestinal inflammation. It is a possible mechanism of digestive symptoms in the COVID-19 patients and explains the presence of the virus in patients’ stool samples. The study also highlights the necessity of taking stool samples for suspected patients to help in early diagnosis and assessment of disease status."

This study included adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 form Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China), with or without influenza, and compared their clinical characteristics.
Results
Among 93 patients, 44 died and 49 were discharged. Forty-four (47.3%) were infected with influenza virus A and two (2.2%) with influenza virus B. Twenty-two (50.0%) of the non-survivors and 24 (49.0%) of the survivors were infected with the influenza virus. Critically ill COVID-19 patients with influenza were more prone to cardiac injury than those without influenza. For the laboratory indicators at admission the following were higher in non-survivors with influenza than in those without influenza: white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, D-dimer value, and proportion of elevated creatinine.
Conclusion
The results showed that a high proportion of COVID-19 patients were co-infected with influenza in Tongji Hospital, with no significant difference in the proportion of co-infection between survivors and non-survivors. The critically ill COVID-19 patients with influenza exhibited more severe inflammation and organ injury, indicating that co-infection with the influenza virus may induce an earlier and more frequently occurring cytokine storm."

abstract = "Background
Human-to-human transmission of Mycobacterium leprae among household contacts of active leprosy cases is significant, and surveillance of household contacts is vital to interrupting the transmission chain for this disease. This study was conducted to identify similarities in M. leprae strains, based on genomic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), among cases and their household contacts and in multicase families in order to decipher possible associations, transmission links, various clinical conditions of index cases that enhance person-to-person transmission, and timelines for transmission patterns.
Methods
PCR for M. leprae DNA detection (amplification of the Rlep gene) and SNP subtyping of M. leprae strains was performed for 61 index cases and one of their household contacts. Additionally, we studied six families with multiple cases of leprosy, to understand timelines of infectivity and its relation to severity of the disease in the index cases.
Results
Index cases with lepromatous (LL) and borderline lepromatous (BL) leprosy, together with a positive bacteriological index (BI) for M. leprae, result in a higher percentage of their contacts subclinically infected with M. leprae, with odds ratios (OR) of 6.6 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6–27.6) for BL and LL, and 7.07 (CI 1.41–35.41) for BI-positive index cases. 75% of the case–contact pairs had a similar SNP subtype of M. leprae. The timeline of infection in multicase families revealed that contacts were infected during the BI-positive period of the index case.
Conclusion
Using molecular methods, we determined that positivity for M. leprae DNA in contacts of index leprosy cases was attributed to clinical characteristics of leprosy in the index cases. LL and BL forms of leprosy, together with positive BI, contributed to dissemination of infection to household contacts. In conclusion, we found a relationship between SNP subtypes within index case–contact pairs. This method can help decipher the transmission patterns and identify individuals at risk of contracting leprosy."

Pathogen identification is crucial for the diagnosis and management of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). Although culturing methods are the foundation of pathogen detection in PJI, false-negative results often occur. Oxford nanopore sequencing (ONS) is a promising alternative for detecting pathogens and providing information on their antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles, without culturing.
Methods
To evaluate the capability of metagenomic ONS (mONS) in detecting pathogens from PJI samples, both metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and mONS were performed in 15 osteoarticular samples from nine consecutive PJI patients according to the modified Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) criteria. The sequencing data generated from both platforms were then analyzed for pathogen identification and AMR detection using an in-house-developed bioinformatics pipeline.
Results
Our results showed that mONS could be applied to detect the causative pathogen and characterize its AMR features in fresh PJI samples. By real-time sequencing and analysis, pathogen identification and AMR detection from the initiation of sequencing were accelerated.
Conclusion
We showed proof of concept that mONS can function as a rapid, accurate tool in PJI diagnostic microbiology. Despite efforts to reduce host DNA, the high proportion of host DNA was still a limitation of this method that prevented full genome analysis."

abstract = "Objective
The aim of this study was to analyze the epidemiological impact of murine typhus in patients who required hospitalization in the National Health System (SNS) in Spain between 1997 and 2015.
Background
Murine typhus (MT) is a zoonosis caused by Rickettsia typhi. MT is transmitted from rats, cats, dogs, and opossums to humans by their fleas. The clinical picture is characterized by headache, fever, rash, and liver function alteration. The prevalence of MT is considered underestimated since most cases are mild and self-limited. However, up to 10% of patients develop serious complications such as pneumonia or acute kidney injury and may even need admission to intensive care units.
Methods
This was a retrospective longitudinal descriptive study of inpatients diagnosed with Rickettsia typhi infection (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM], 081.0) in Spanish public hospitals between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2015. Data were obtained from the Minimum Basic Data Set (MBDS, CMBD in Spanish), which includes information about inpatients admitted to the National Health System (NHS) hospitals provided by the Health Information Institute of the Ministry of Health and Equality.
Results
Ninety-nine inpatients were included. The incidence rate of MT was 0.12 (95% CI, 0.09-0.14) cases per one million person-years. Cases were irregularly distributed throughout the period of study, with a slight upward trend between 2013 and 2015. The Canary Islands had the highest incidence rate: 2.17 (95% CI, 1.69–2.64) cases per one million person-years (80 cases). Most patients were men (63.6%). The mean age (±SD) was 46.4 years (±19). Five patients were under 15 years old. Approximately 85.9% of cases required urgent hospital admissions. The average hospital stay was 11 days (±9.9). Only 1 patient died.
Conclusions
Although considered uncommon, the incidence of MT seems to be increasing slowly. Most cases occurred in middle-aged men between late summer and early autumn in Spain. The Canary Islands and Andalusia registered the highest number of cases. The MBDS is an appropriate approach to study MT hospital management."

The aim of this paper was to monitor the presence of SARS-Cov-2 among hospital environment surfaces, sewage, and personal protective equipment (PPE) of staffs in isolation wards in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, China.
Methods
Surfaces of objects were routinely wiped with 1000mg/L chlorine containing disinfectant. Air and sewage disinfection was proceeded routinely and strictly. Hospital environmental surfaces and PPE of staffs in isolation wards were sampled using swabs. The sewage from various inlet and outlets were sampled. The respiratory and stool specimens of patients were collected. The respiratory specimens of staffs in the isolation wards were also sampled once a week. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) methods were used to confirm the existence of SARS-Cov-2 RNA. Viral culture was done for the samples positive for SARS-Cov-2 RNA.
Results
During the study period, 33 laboratory-confirmed patients were hospitalized in isolation wards in the hospital. None of SARS-Cov-2 RNA was detected among the 36 objects surface samples and 9 staffs PPE samples in isolation wards. Though the 3 sewage samples from the inlet of preprocessing disinfection pool were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and the sample from the outlet of preprocessing disinfection pool was weakly positive, the sewage sample from the outlet of the last disinfection pool was negative. All of the 5 sewage samples from various points were negative by viral culture of SARS-Cov-2. None of the respiratory specimens of staffs in the isolation wards were positive.
Conclusions
Though SARS-Cov-2 RNA of the sewage samples were positive from inlets of the sewage disinfection pool and negative from the outlet of the last sewage disinfection pool, no viable virus was detected by culture. The monitoring data in this study suggested that the strict disinfection and hand hygiene could decrease the hospital-associated COVID-19 infection risk of the staffs in isolation wards."

We aimed to compare and contrast the proportions of treatment outcome between developing and developed countries in children treated for multidrug resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB).
Methods
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of articles published on children treated for MDR-TB. We searched published articles from electronic databases: PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science for English articles without restricting publication year. We employed random-effects meta-analysis model to estimate the pooled proportions of treatment success, death, treatment failure and lost to follow up.
Results
We pooled data of 1,343 children obtained from 17 included studies, and the overall pooled treatment success was 77.0% (95% Confidence Interval (CI), 69.0–85.0). Pooled treatment success in developing countries was 73.0% (63.0–83.0), while in developed countries 87.0% (81.0–94.0). The overall pooled treatment failure was 3.0% (1.0–6.0), while death 8.0% (4.0–11.0) and lost to follow up 10.0% (6.0–4).
Conclusion
MDR-TB treatment success in children is well achieved in both developed and developing countries by currently available drugs. Improving MDR-TB treatment programme is vital to achieve the maximum treatment successful. Promoting research on pediatric MDR-TB treatment outcome could also help to fill evidence gap."

This study aimed to determine the burden of sepsis with focal infections in the resource-limited context of Indonesia and to propose national prices for sepsis reimbursement.
Methods
A retrospective observational study was conducted from 2013–2016 on cost of surviving and non-surviving sepsis patients from a payer perspective using inpatient billing records in four hospitals. The national burden of sepsis was calculated and proposed national prices for reimbursement were developed.
Results
Of the 14,076 sepsis patients, 5,876 (41.7%) survived and 8,200 (58.3%) died. The mean hospital costs incurred per surviving and deceased sepsis patient were US$1,011 (SE ± 23.4) and US$1,406 (SE ± 27.8), respectively. The national burden of sepsis in 100,000 patients was estimated to be US$130 million. Sepsis patients with multifocal infections and a single focal lower-respiratory tract infection (LRTI) were estimated as being the two with the highest economic burden (US$48 million and US$33 million, respectively, within 100,000 sepsis patients). Sepsis with cardiovascular infection was estimated to warrant the highest proposed national price for reimbursement (US$4,256).
Conclusions
Multifocal infections and LRTIs are the major focal infections with the highest burden of sepsis. This study showed varying cost estimates for sepsis, necessitating a new reimbursement system with adjustment of the national prices taking the particular foci into account."

Clostridioides difficile is the major cause of infectious nosocomial diarrhoea in industrialized nations. Data on the occurrence of C. difficile in Africa, ribotype (RT) distribution, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and potential zoonotic transmission are scarce.
Methods
80 Zimbabwean C. difficile isolates from different sources (chicken [n=30], soil [n=21] and humans [n=29]) were investigated using ribotyping, toxin gene detection, resistance testing, multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), and whole genome sequencing (WGS).
Results
Among chicken isolates, the most common RTs were RT103 (6/30), RT025 (5/30) and RT070 (4/30). Within soil samples, RT025 and RT056 were most common (3/21 each). In contrast, the non-toxigenic RT084 was most frequently found in human isolates (4/29). Toxin genes were detected in only 19/29 human isolates. Susceptibility testing showed no resistance against metronidazole and vancomycin, and resistance against macrolides and rifampicin was scarce (3/80 and 2/80, respectively); however, 26/80 isolates showed moxifloxacin resistance. MLVA and WGS of strains with identical RTs stemming from different sources revealed clustering of RT025 and RT084 isolates from human und non-human samples.
Conclusion
No “hypervirulent” strains were found. The detected clusters between human, chicken and soil isolates indicate ongoing transmission between humans and environmental sources and might point towards a zoonotic potential."

Invasive disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis is a significant health concern globally, but our knowledge of the prevailing serogroups, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, and genetics of N. meningitidis in Southeast Asia is limited. Chloramphenicol resistance in N. meningitidis has rarely been reported, but was first described in isolates from Vietnam in 1998. We aimed to characterise eight chloramphenicol resistant meningococcal isolates collected between 2007 and 2018 from diagnostic microbiology laboratories in Cambodia, Thailand and the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Laos).
Methods
Whole-genome sequencing was used to generate genome sequences from 18 meningococcal isolates including the eight chloramphenicol resistant isolates. We identified antimicrobial resistance genes present in these strains, and examined the phylogenetic relationships between strains.
Results
The eight resistant strains all contain the same chloramphenicol resistance gene first described in 1998, and are closely related to each other. Strains resistant to penicillin, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin were also observed, including a chloramphenicol-resistant strain which has acquired penicillin and ciprofloxacin resistance.
Conclusions
This study suggests that chloramphenicol-resistant N. meningitidis is more widespread than previously thought, and that the previously-identified resistant lineage is now found in multiple countries in Southeast Asia."

From March 2014 to June 2019, medical records from multiple centers were searched. Logistic regression analyses were performed. A predictive model for multidrug-resistance (MDR) was developed and validated. Calibration and discrimination of the model were assessed.
Results
Inconsistent results were found in the systemic review. A multicenter chart review with 657 records was thus conducted. The HbA1c <7% group and HbA1c ≥7% group had 390 and 267 patients, respectively. The HbA1c<7% group had a lower risk of developing rifampicin resistance, isoniazid resistance and MDR, with odd ratios (ORs) of 1.904 (p=0.001), 2.896 (p<0.001) and 3.228 (p<0.001), respectively. The between-group differences in the risk of anti-TB drug resistance were analyzed based on data from three provinces in China. After adding HbA1c grading, the predictive model for MDR (https://mengyuan.shinyapps.io/Shinyapp/) showed excellent capacity with an AUC of 75.4% in the training set (Sichuan and Gansu) and 73.9% in the internal validation set (Henan). The performances in calibration, prediction probabilities and net clinical benefit were significantly improved by HbA1c grading.

Prophylactic antibiotic use in preterm pre-labor rupture of membranes (PPROM) is associated with a significant reduction in intra-amniotic infection and improved neonatal outcome. However, data is insufficient to determine the optimal antibiotic regimen. Considering the rise in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia early-onset sepsis rate and the emergence of ampicillin resistance, our aim is to compare the efficiency of two antibiotic regimens in prolonging pregnancy and reducing infectious morbidity.
Design
This multicenter randomized unblinded controlled prospective trial compared two antibiotic prophylactic protocols in PPROM: ampicillin + roxithromycin vs. cefuroxime + roxithromycin in 84 women with PPROM, from 12/2015-12/2019.
Results
The median latency period was significantly longer (p = 0.039) in the cefuroxime + roxithromycin group (4.63 [0.59–50.18] days) than in the ampicillin + roxithromycin group (2.3 [0.15–58.3] days). Neonatal admission to neonatal intensive care unit rate, hospitalization length, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, neonatal fever, and need for respiratory support or mechanical ventilation, were similar between the groups. K. pneumonia cultures were significantly more frequent in the ampicillin + roxithromycin group. None of the cultures were group B Streptococcus positive.
Conclusions
To prolong latency period and reduce gram-negative early-onset sepsis, cefuroxime + roxithromycin is recommended as the first-line protocol in PPROM.

Blood smears and spots were collected respectively for microscopy and qPCR. Parasitemia slope half-life was calculated after microscopy. Patient residual parasitemia were measured by qPCR.
Results
Uncorrected adequate clinical and parasitological responses (ACPR) observed in Faladje and Bougoula-Hameau were 78% and 92%, respectively (p=0.01). This reached 100% for both after molecular correction. Proportions of 24H microscopy positive patients in Faladje and Bougoula-Hameau were 97.2% and 72%, respectively (p<0.0001). Slope half-life was 2.8h in Faladje vs 2H in Bougoula-Hameau (p<0.001) and Proportions of 72H patients with residual parasitemia were 68.5% and 40% in Faladje and Bougoula-Hameau, respectively (p=0.003). The mean residual parasitemia was 2.9 in Faladje vs. 0.008 in Bougoula-Hameau (p=0.002). Although artesunate is efficacious in Mali, the longer parasite clearance time with submicroscopic parasitemia observed may represent early signs of developing P. falciparum resistance to artemisinins."

abstract = "Background
COVID-19 disease is becoming a global pandemic and more than 200 countries were affected because of this disease. Italy is one of the countries is largely suffered with this virus outbreak, and about 180,000 cases (as of 20 April 2020) were registered which explains the large transmissibility and reproduction case numbers.
Objective
In this study, we considered the Marche region of Italy to compute different daily transmission rates (Rt) including five provinces in it. We also present forecasting of daily and cumulative incidences associated after the next thirty days. The Marche region is the 8th in terms of number of people infected in Italy and the first in terms of diffusion of the infection among the 4 regions of the center of Italy.
Methods
Epidemic statistics were extracted from the national Italian Health Ministry website. We considered outbreak information where the first case registered in Marche with onset symptoms (26 February 2020) to the present date (20 April 2020). Adoption of incidence and projections with R statistics was done.
Results
The median values of Rt for the five provinces of Pesaro and Urbano, Ancona, Fermo, Ascoli Piceno, and Macerata, was 2.492 (1.1–4.5), 2.162 (1.0–4.0), 1.512 (0.75–2.75), 1.141 (1.0–1.6), and 1.792 (1.0–3.5) with 95% of CI achieved. The projections at end of 30th day of the cumulative incidences 323 (95% CI), and daily incidences 45 (95% CI) could be possible.
Conclusions
This study highlights the knowledge of essential insights into the Marche region in particular to virus transmission dynamics, geographical characteristics of positive incidences, and the necessity of implementing mitigation procedures to fight against the COVID-19 outbreak."

This study aimed to build and test a filtered eye mask (FEM) to protect the eyes from airborne particles, while being usable without excessive fog build up.
Methods
The steps performed to build the FEM were described. A hermetically-sealed standard eye mask (SEM) and an FEM were examined at 1-minute, 5-minute and 60-minute periods for performance metrics relating to fog.
Results
The SEM showed minimal fog at 1minute, lots of fog at 5minutes and was dripping with condensation at 60minutes. The FEM was clear at 1minute, 5minutes and showed minimal fog at 60minutes.
Conclusion
An FEM may play an important role in preventing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) exposure by protecting the eyes from airborne particles and preventing fog, rendering it usable. Further research is strongly recommended."

Non-device related right-sided infective endocarditis (ND-RSIE) is not well characterized. We aimed to characterize patients with infective endocarditis (IE) with emphasis on the epidemiology, clinical characteristics and complications of ND-RSIE.
Methods
In this population-based cohort study, we identified patients with IE using ICD-10 codes from the Danish National Hospital Register in the Region of Southern Denmark between January 2007 and May 2017. Hospital records were reviewed, and characteristics and outcomes recorded.
Results
We included 1243 confirmed IE episodes of which 82% were left-sided IE, 11% were cardiac device right sided infective endocarditis (RSIE) and 7% were ND-RSIE. Patients with ND-RSIE were considerably younger, had less comorbidity and had a lower 30-day mortality (6%) compared with patients with device RSIE (24%) and left-sided IE (26%) (p<0.01). ND-RSIE was associated with underlying heart disease, involvement of the tricuspid valve (57%), Staphylococcus species (53%) and complications (61%). Forty percent of ND-RSIE occurred among people who inject drugs (PWID) for whom significant differences were observed compared with non-PWID with regards to tricuspid valve involvement (96% vs. 32%), causative microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus 79% vs. 27%), complications (86% vs. 45%), recurrence (29% vs. 11%) and 30-day mortality (0% vs. 7%).
Conclusion
ND-RSIE is relatively rare and differs with regards to epidemiology, clinical characteristics and complications compared with left-sided IE and cardiac device RSIE, but has a favourable prognosis. Forty percent of ND-RSIE occurs among PWID, which is associated with frequent complications but a very low mortality."

The purpose of this study was to analyze the clinical characteristics of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) cured by antiviral therapy.
Methods
Forty-two patients with CHB were enrolled. All patients had been treated with peginterferon (Peg-IFN) in combination with nucleoside analogue (NA) therapy for variable amounts of time, and all had been successfully cured of the disease.
Results
The combined treatment time for all participants was 124.7 ± 58.8 weeks, and the average Peg-IFN treatment time was 102.6 ± 56.1 weeks. At 24 weeks, Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) had decreased more than 50% from baseline. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of the week 96 HBsAg-clearing group and the non-HBsAg-clearing group showed a statistically significant difference in baseline HBV DNA levels and week 48 HBsAg levels. Those which baseline HBV DNA was < 2.75 log10 IU/mL, and week 48 HBsAg levels were < 0.88 log10 IU/mL were more likely to achieve rapid HBsAg clearance at 96 weeks. This suggests that low levels of baseline HBV DNA and week 48 HBsAg are a predictor of rapid HBsAg clearance at 96 weeks.
Conclusions
Individualized extension of combination therapy to more than 96 weeks depending on the patient’s response and adverse reaction conditions can help achieve a clinical cure. Patients with low baseline HBV DNA and low HBsAg levels at 48 weeks achieve HBsAg clearance more quickly than other populations."

This study aimed to perform genotyping of Toxoplasma gondii strain or variant causing atypical toxoplasmic uveitis in Indonesian patients.
Methods
Ocular fluid samples originating from 46 uveitis patients with non-specific ocular manifestations were analysed for Toxoplasma infection by PCR of the B1 locus. The clonal type was determined by amplification, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of SAG2 and GRA6 loci in B1-positive samples. Clinical data were obtained from the medical records.
Results
Pan uveitis was the most frequent manifestation (65.2%) and mostly unilateral (76.1%). PCR of the B1 locus identified eight positive subjects (12.5%); six had panuveitis and two of these had diabetes mellitus. Phylogenetic analysis with maximum likelihood of the SAG2 locus in the B1-positive samples resulted in Toxoplasma gondii SAG2 type III allele. No positive result was obtained from the PCR of GRA6 locus.
Conclusion
Toxoplasma gondii SAG2-type III allele was identified in an atypical presentation of toxoplasmic uveitis in Indonesia."

The differential diagnosis between novel coronavirus pneumonia patients (NCPP) and influenza patients (IP) remains a challenge in clinical practice.
Methods
Between January 2018 and March 2020, 1,027 NCPP and 1,140 IP were recruited from Tongji hospital. Routine blood examination, biochemical indicators and coagulation function analysis were simultaneously performed in all participants.
Results
There was no sex predominance in NCPP. The NCPP were frequently encountered in the sixth and seventh decades of life. The mean age of NCPP (56±16 years) was higher than IP (47±17 years), but without statistical difference. Although most results of routine laboratory tests between NCPP and IP had no significant differences, some laboratory tests showed an obvious change in NCPP. It was observed that NCPP had significantly decreased white blood cells, alkaline phosphatase and d-dimer compared with IP. However, the results of lactate dehydrogenase, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and fibrinogen were significantly increased in NCPP compared with IP. The diagnostic model based on a combination of 18 routine laboratory indicators showed an area under the curve of 0.796 (95% CI, 0.777–0.814), with a sensitivity of 46.93% and specificity of 90.09% when using a cut-off value of 0.598.

COVID-19 is spreading quickly all over the world. Publicly released data for 1212 COVID-19 patients in Henan of China were analyzed in this paper.
Methods
Various statistical and network analysis methods were employed.
Results
We found that COVID-19 patients show gender (55% vs 45%) and age (81% aged between 21 and 60) preferences; possible causes were explored. The estimated average, mode and median incubation periods are 7.4, 4 and 7 days. Incubation periods of 92% of patients were no more than 14 days. The epidemic in Henan has undergone three stages and has shown high correlations with the numbers of patients recently returned from Wuhan. Network analysis revealed that 208 cases were clustering infected, and various People's Hospitals are the main force in treating COVID-19.
Conclusions
The incubation period was statistically estimated, and the proposed state transition diagram can explore the epidemic stages of emerging infectious disease. We suggest that although the quarantine measures are gradually working, strong measures still might be needed for a period of time, since ∼7.45% of patients may have very long incubation periods. Migrant workers or college students are at high risk. State transition diagrams can help us to recognize the time-phased nature of the epidemic.

Given the high need and the absence of specific antivirals for treatment of COVID-19 (the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2]), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitors are being considered as therapeutic alternatives.
Methods
Prezcobix/Rezolsta is a fixed-dose combination of 800 mg of the HIV protease inhibitor darunavir (DRV) and 150 mg cobicistat, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, which is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection. There are currently no definitive data on the safety and efficacy of DRV/cobicistat for the treatment of COVID-19. The in vitro antiviral activity of darunavir against a clinical isolate from a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 was assessed.
Results
DRV showed no antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 at clinically relevant concentrations (EC50 > 100 μM). Remdesivir, used as a positive control, demonstrated potent antiviral activity (EC50 = 0.38 μM).

Genes of host immunity play an important role in disease pathogenesis and are determinants of clinical courses of infections, including hepatitis B virus (HBV). Killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR), expressed on the surface of natural killer cells (NK), regulate NK cell cytotoxicity by interacting with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules and are candidates for influencing the course of HBV. This study evaluated whether variations in KIR gene content and HLA-C ligands are associated with HBV and with the development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
Methods
A Vietnamese study cohort (HBV n = 511; controls n = 140) was genotyped using multiplex sequence-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR-SSP) followed by melting curve analysis.
Results
The presence of the functional allelic group of KIR2DS4 was associated with an increased risk of chronic HBV (OR = 1.86, pcorr = 0.02), while KIR2DL2+HLA-C1 (OR = 0.62, pcorr = 0.04) and KIR2DL3+HLA-C1 (OR = 0.48, pcorr = 0.04) were associated with a decreased risk. The pair KIR2DL3+HLA-C1 was associated with liver cirrhosis (OR = 0.40, pcorr = 0.01). The presence of five or more activating KIR variants was associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (OR = 0.53, pcorr = 0.04).
Conclusions
KIR gene content variation and combinations KIR-HLA influence the outcome of HBV infection."

Methods
A retrospective study was conducted of adult TB patients aged ≥15 years who were treated at Connaught Hospital in Freetown, Sierra Leone from January through December 2017. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of mortality.
Results
Of 1127 TB cases notified in 2017, 1105 (98%) were tested for HIV, yielding a TB/HIV co-infection rate of 32.0%. Only HIV-tested cases (n=1105) were included in the final analysis. The majority were male (69.3%), aged 25–34 years (29.2%), and had pulmonary TB (96.3%). Treatment outcomes were as follows: 29.0% cured, 29.0% completed, 0.5% treatment failure, 24.2% lost to follow-up, 12.8% transferred/not evaluated, and 4.5% died. The majority of deaths (80.0%, 40/50) occurred within 2 months of TB treatment initiation.

abstract = "Background
Influenza viruses evolve rapidly and cause regular seasonal epidemics in humans challenging effective vaccination. The virus surface HA glycoprotein is the primary target for the host immune response. Here, we investigated the vaccine efficacy and evolution patterns of human influenza A/H3N2 viruses that circulated in Kenyan in the period before and after the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic, targeting the HA1 domain.
Materials and methods
A hundred and fifteen HA sequences of Kenyan virus viruses were analyzed relative to the corresponding WHO vaccine reference strains using bioinformatics approaches.
Results
Our analyses revealed varied amino acid substitutions at all the five antigenic sites (A–E) of the HA1 domain, with a majority the changes occurring at sites A and B. The Kenyan A/H3N2 viruses isolated during 2007/2008 seasons belonged to A/Brisbane/10/2007-like viruses lineage, while those circulating in 2009–2012 belonged to the lineage of A/Victoria/361/2011-like viruses. The 2013 viruses clustered in clade 3C.3 of the A/Samara/73/2013-like viruses. The mean evolutionary rate of the A/H3N2 viruses analyzed in the study was at 4.17×10−3 (95% HPD=3.09×10−3–5.31×10−3) nucleotide substitutions per site per year, whereas the TMRCA was estimated at 11.18 (95% HPD=9.00–14.12) years ago from 2013. The prediction of vaccine efficacy revealed modest vaccine efficaciousness during 2008, and 2010 influenza seasons, whilst sub-optimal effectiveness was registered in 2007, 2009, 2012 and 2013. Further, the overall selective pressure acting on the HA1 domain was estimated at 0.56 (ω<1), suggesting that a majority of codon sites in the HA1 epitopes were evolving under purifying selection.
Conclusions
Generally, our results highlight the genetic plasticity of A/H3N2 viruses and reveal considerable disparity in vaccine efficaciousness against the A/H3N2 viruses that circulated in Kenya, specifically during 2007, 2009, 2012, and 2013 influenza seasons. Our findings underscore the importance and need for consistent surveillance and molecular characterization of influenza viruses, to inform decision making and enhance early of detection of strains with epidemic/pandemic potential as well as benefit in guiding decisions regarding the appropriate annual influenza vaccine formulations."

To assess the potential epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness of shorter antibiotic regimens in high tuberculosis (TB) burden regions of Taiwan.
Methods
This study combined the TB population dynamic model and cost-effectiveness analysis with local data to simulate the disease burdens, effectiveness and costs of hypothetical 4-month, 2-month and 7-day regimens compared with the standard regimen.
Results
The main outcomes were the potential of shorter regimens for averted incidence, mortality and disability-adjusted life years, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and net monetary benefit. Shorter regimens would lower incidence rates and mortality cases in a high TB burden region by an average of 19–33% and 27–41%, respectively, with the potential for cost-effectiveness or cost-saving. The 2-month and 7-day regimens would be more cost-effective than the 4-month regimen. The threshold daily drug prices for achieving cost-effectiveness and cost-saving for 4-month, 2-month and 7-day regimens were $US1, $US2 and $US70, respectively. Such cost-effectiveness would remain, even if the willingness-to-pay threshold was less than one gross domestic product per capita.
Conclusions
The findings support the inclusion of shorter regimens in global guidelines and regional-scale TB control strategies, which would improve disease control, particularly in settings with high rates of incidence and poor treatment outcomes."

The objective of our study was to introduce community quarantine strategy against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Anhui and evaluate the effectiveness of community quarantine based on trauma center (TC) patients.
Method
The structure of community quarantine strategy was illustrated. Distribution of injuries among patients in two TCs between January 24, 2020 and February 24, 2020 was described. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze the correlation between the distribution of Injuries in TCs and the number of COVID-19-associated cases.
Results
A total of 757 TC patients in the two hospitals were enrolled. The number of traffic injuries and outdoor injuries showed a significant decrease in the early stage and began to increase on February 17. The number of indoor injuries neither decreased nor increased. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed a significant correlation between COVID-19-associated cases and traffic and outdoor injuries.
Conclusion
From the perspective of the injuries in TCs, community quarantine strategy was effectively implemented and significantly slowed the outbreak of COVID-19 in Anhui. However, the implementation and maintenance of the strategy is costly and requires the participation of the entire population."

To evaluate the performance of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for predicting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) drug resistance.
Methods
276 rifampin-resistance tuberculosis (RR-TB) and 30 rifampicin-sensitive clinical isolates were randomly selected from patients with tuberculosis in Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital (SPH). Phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) against six anti-TB drugs was performed, and WGS was used to predict the drug resistance using an online ‘TB-Profiler’ tool.
Results
Using phenotypic susceptibility as the gold standard, the overall sensitivities and specificities for WGS were 94.53% and 92.00% for isoniazid, 97.10% and 100.00% for rifampicin, 97.46% and 64.36% for ethambutol, 97.14% and 95.83% or streptomycin, 93.02% and 98.87% for ofloxacin, and 75.00% and 100.00% for amikacin, respectively.

Background
Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has been proposed to be a powerful tool to predict drug resistance for antitubercular drugs. However, the feasibility of WGS in predicting final treatment outcomes for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients remains unclear
Patients and Methods
In this prospective observational study conducted from January 2014 to September 2016, MDR-TB patients were enrolled consecutively. Genotypic drug sensitivity testing was performed via WGS using culture isolates. Patients were followed for two years to determine the treatment outcomes. Multivariate analysis was used to identify the association between information provided by WGS and the final treatment outcomes
Results
A total of 123 patients with MDR-TB were included in this study. The overall favorable treatment outcome rate was 60.2%. Multivariate analysis showed that independent risk factors associated with unfavorable treatment outcome including high-level moxifloxacin phenotypic resistance (OR, 4.362; 95%CI, 1.364-13.950; p=0.013), cycloserine phenotypic resistance (OR, 7.457; 95%CI, 1.644-33.819; p=0.009), mutations causing high-level fluoroquinolones resistance (OR, 3.947; 95%CI, 1.195-13.034; p=0.024), and ethA mutation (OR, 3.817; 95% CI, 1.154-12.823; p=0.028). WGS costs for each patient are ¥450 ($63), and the average turnaround time was one week
Conclusions
In summary, WGS showed promising feasibility in predicting treatment outcomes for MDR-TB patients within a clinically relevant time frame"

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China has been basically controlled. However, the global epidemic of COVID-19 is worsening. We established a method to estimate the instant case fatality rate (CFR) and cure rate of COVID-19 in China.
Methods
A total of 82 735 confirmed cases released officially by the Chinese authorities from December 8, 2019 to April 18, 2020 were collected. The estimated diagnosis dates of deaths and cured cases were calculated based on the median cure time or median death time of individual cases. Following this, the instant CFR was calculated according to the number of deaths and cured cases on the same estimated diagnosis date.
Results
In China, the instant CFR of COVID-19 was 3.8–14.6% from January 1 to January 17; it then declined gradually and stabilized at 5.7% in April. The average CFR in China was 6.1±2.9%, while the CFR was 1.0±0.4% in China except Hubei Province. The cure rate of COVID-19 was 93.9±2.9% in China, and stabilized at 94.3%, while it was 99.0±0.4% in China except Hubei Province.
Conclusions
The instant CFR of COVID-19 in China overall was much higher than that in China except Hubei Province. The CFR of COVID-19 in China was underestimated."

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new respiratory and systemic disease which needs quick identification of potential critical patients. This meta-analysis aimed to explore the relationship between lymphocyte count and the severity of COVID-19.
Methods
A comprehensive systematic literature search was carried out to find studies published from December 2019 to 22 March 2020 from five databases. The language of literatures included English and Chinese. Mean difference (MD) of lymphocyte count in COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease and odds ratio (OR) of lymphopenia for severe form of COVID-19 was evaluated with this meta-analysis.
Results
Overall 13 case-series with a total of 2282 cases were included in the study. The pooled analysis showed that lymphocyte count was significantly lower in severe COVID-19 patients (MD -0.31×109/L; 95%CI: -0.42 to -0.19×109/L). The presence of lymphopenia was associated with nearly threefold increased risk of severe COVID-19 (Random effects model, OR=2.99, 95% CI: 1.31-6.82).

The study was aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and evaluate the dynamic changes of chest CT features in the first three weeks in the common type fo COVID-19 pneumonia patients in Jiangsu Province.
Methods
307 patients infected SARS-CoV-2 classified as common type were enrolled in the study. 628 chest CT scans were divided into three groups based on the time interval between symptoms and chest CT scan. The clinical characteristics were descriptively analyzed.The chest CT features were quantitatively evaluated. Mann-Whitney U test was used to test the differences in three groups and between men and women. Spearman rank correlation was used to test the association between the arterial blood gas(ABG) analysis results and chest CT scores.
Results
Fever (69.1%) and cough (62.8%) were common symptoms. 111(36.2%) patients were anorexia. GGO was the most common manifestation of COVID-19 pneumonia, which could be followed by consolidation and fibrosis. Lower lobe or subpleural region was the most common distribution form of lesion. More lung lobes were involved in the third week. Total chest CT scores in the second week were higher than the first week. Fibrosis Scores increased in the second and third week. Total CT score, GGO score and fibrosis score of male patients were significantly higher than female in the second week. Male patients had higher consolidation score and fibrosis score than female in the third week. Total CT score and GGO score had weak to moderate correlation with arterial blood gas indices.
Conclusion
Changes in chest CT were difficult to assess quantitatively in the first third weeks. Male patients recovered slower than female in the second week. Although CT score had correlations with arterial blood gas indices, long-term follow-up of pulmonary function test is needed to determine the recovery of lung."

abstract = "Introduction
Sepsis is the leading cause of infectious morbidity and mortality among hospitalized neonates. In high-resource pediatric and adult intensive care units, use of aqueous chlorhexidine (CHG) solution has been associated with reduced risk of bloodstream infections (BSI).
Objectives
To assess the impact of bathing of neonates with 2% CHG on BSI, suspected sepsis, and mortality in a low-income country neonatal care unit.
Methods
We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the Sepsis Prevention in Neonates in Zambia (SPINZ) study, a prospective observational cohort study performed at a large public referral hospital in Lusaka, Zambia. The SPINZ study assessed the impact of an infection control bundle (consisting of alcohol hand rub, SMS hygiene reminders, enhanced environmental cleaning, and CHG baths for babies ≥1.5 kg) on sepsis, BSI, and all-cause mortality. Episodic shortages in study staffing resulted in some enrolled babies not receiving a CHG bath. Using Longitudinal Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Cox proportional hazards regression to adjust for observed confounding, we estimated the causal effect of receiving a CHG bath within the first 3 days of life on suspected sepsis, BSI, and death among inborn babies enrolled during the study implementation and intervention phases.
Results
The majority of inborn, enrolled babies ≥1.5 kg received a CHG bath within 3 days of NICU admission (864 of 1233, 70%). We found that CHG bathing reduced the hazard rate of BSI among inborn babies ≥1.5 kg by a factor of 0.58 (p = 0.10, 95% CI: 0.31, 1.11), corresponding to an absolute risk reduction of 9.6 percentage points within a week of admission (p = 0.002, 95% CI: 3.4–15.7 percentage points). We did not find a statistically significant effect of CHG bathing on culture-negative sepsis (p = 0.54) or death (p = 0.85).
Conclusion
In our single center study, CHG bathing at admission was associated with a reduced risk of BSI due to a pathogenic organism after adjusting for potential confounding. Our results suggest that CHG may be an effective intervention for preventing neonatal sepsis in high-risk, low-income country settings."

The rate of surgical site infection (SSI) after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is high and insertion of preoperative bile duct catheterization (PBDC) predispose a high risk of SSI with multidrug resistant (MDR) microorganisms.
Aim
To describe the effects of PBDC and the prophylaxis in development of SSI.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective study between January 01, 2010 and December 2018 including the patients with PD and total pancreatectomy.
Findings
In total 214 consecutive patients were included. The PBDC was inserted to 63 (29%) patients. The rate of intraoperative bile fluid culture positivity was higher among the patients with PBDC (84% vs. 17% respectively, p<0.001). The SSI was detected in 52 patients (24%). In multivariate analysis, the rate of SSI was found to be higher among the patients with PBDC (OR: 2.33, 95% Cl: 1.14–4.76, p=0.02). As the etiologic agents of SSI, Pseudomonas spp. and MDR pathogens were mainly detected in PBDC group. The resistance to ampicillin-sulbactam was significantly higher in the PBDC group (87.5% vs. 25%, p=0.012). The similar bacterial species both in bile fluid and the surgical site were detected in 11 (21%) patients with SSI. Among 8 patients (15%), antimicrobial susceptibility was the same. Only in five out of 52 (10%) patients, the SSI pathogens was susceptible to the agent that was used for surgical prophylaxis.
Conclusion
Unnecessary catheterizations should be avoided. By considering the increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria as the cause of SSI, the clinicians should closely follow-up their patients for choosing the proper antimicrobials."

To evaluate the potential probiotic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from feces of infants and also to determine their antimicrobial activity against some enteropathogenic bacteria.
Methods
The Fecal samples were prepared from 120 infants aged less than 24 months. In total, 105 Lactobacillus strains were identified by phenotypic tests. Thirty isolates were randomly selected to study their potential probiotic properties. These isolates were examined for resistance to acid (pH: 2.5, 2 h) and bile (oxgall 0.3%, 8 h), adhesion to HT-29 cells, antibiotic susceptibility, and antimicrobial activities.
Results
On basis of 16S rRNA sequencing, 30 isolates identified as Lactobacillus fermentum (n = 11; 36.7%), Lactobacillus plantarum (n = 9; 30%), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (n = 6; 20%), and Lactobacillus paracasei (n = 4; 13.3%). All tested strains survived at acid and bile conditions. Six Lactobacillus strains revealed high adherence to HT-29 cells. Three strains including the L. fermentum (N2, N7), and the L. plantarum (N20) showed good probiotic potential and inhibited the growth of Yersinia enterocolitica ATCC 23715, Shigella flexneri ATCC 12022, Salmonella enterica ATCC 9270, and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) ATCC 43887. The antibiotic resistance test showed that all the isolates were susceptible to tetracycline, and chloramphenicol.
Conclusions
Lactobacillus strains like L. fermentum (N2, N7), and the L. plantarum (N20), could be potential probiotic, but further in vitro and in vivo studies on these probiotic strains are still required."

The odds of unresolved symptoms after 28 days were associated with age for RSV only. Illness deterioration was associated with age for RSV, with patients 75+ at increased risk, but not for influenza.
Conclusion
In adults presenting to primary care with acute cough, the diagnostic features of RSV or influenza infection are not associated with age. For RSV both the prevalence and illness course are significantly worse at higher age, for influenza only the illness course is."

abstract = "Introduction
Coronaviruses, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, first appeared in China. They have certain biological, epidemiological and pathological similarities. To date, research has shown that their genes exhibit 79% of identical sequences and the receptor-binding domain structure is also very similar. There has been extensive research performed on SARS; however, the understanding of the pathophysiological impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still limited.
Methods
This review drew upon the lessons learnt from SARS, in terms of epidemiology, clinical characteristics and pathogenesis, to further understand the features of COVID-19.
Results
By comparing these two diseases, it found that COVID-19 has quicker and wider transmission, obvious family agglomeration, and higher morbidity and mortality. Newborns, asymptomatic children and normal chest imaging cases emerged in COVID-19 literature. Children starting with gastrointestinal symptoms may progress to severe conditions and newborns whose mothers are infected with COVID-19 could have severe complications. The laboratory test data showed that the percentage of neutrophils and the level of LDH is higher, and the number of CD4+ and CD8+T-cells is decreased in children's COVID-19 cases.
Conclusion
Based on these early observations, as pediatricians, this review put forward some thoughts on children's COVID-19 and gave some recommendations to contain the disease."

The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemic scope, epidemic pattern and degree of damage of clonorchiasis as well as to summarize the diagnosis and control effect of clonorchiasis in Shandong Province, China.
Methods
A retrospective study was conducted to summarize the research on the dynamic epidemiology and the prevention and treatment measures of clonorchiasis in Shandong Province, China from 1962 to 2015.
Results
After unremitting efforts and three nationwide surveys on the distribution and infection of human parasites, the infection rate of clonorchiasis decreased from 1.51% (1,500, 000) in the1960s to 0.16% in 1991, 0.04% in 2000 and 0.007% in 2015, respectively. The infection rate for villages with perennial water accumulation and rainy season water accumulation was higher than that of villages with rainy season water accumulation and non-water accumulation. The egg flotation in 70% potassium iodide solution method was applied to accurately test the specific proportion of C. sinensis eggs, which was 1.42. Using the modified Kato thick smear method, the detection rate of eggs was over 98%; hexachloroparaxylene yielded satisfactory therapeutic effects with slight adverse reactions, it is effective in the treatment of clonorchiasis.
Conclusions
After 50 years of active prevention and treatment, the disease has been successfully controlled in Shandong Province and had been used for reference in other endemic areas of clonorchiasis in China."

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading. Here, we summarized the composition of pathogens in fever clinic patients and analyzed the characteristics of different respiratory viral infections.
Methods
Retrospectively collected patients with definite etiological results using nasal and pharyngeal swabs in a fever clinic.
Results
Overall, 1860 patients were screened, and 136 patients were enrolled. 72 (52.94%) of them were diagnosed as influenza (Flu) A virus infection. 32 (23.53%) of them were diagnosed as Flu B virus infection. 18 (13.24%) and 14 (10.29%) of them were diagnosed as COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections, respectively. The COVID-19 group had a higher rate of contact with the epidemic area within 14 days and of clustering onset than other groups. Fever was the most common symptom in these patients. The ratio of fever to the highest temperature was higher in Flu A virus infection patients than in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients had a lower white blood cell count and neutrophil count than Flu A virus and RSV infection groups, but higher lymphocyte count than Flu A and B virus infection groups. The COVID-19 group (83.33%) had a higher rate of pneumonia in chest CT scans than Flu A and B virus infection groups.
Conclusions
Influenza viruses accounted for a large proportion of respiratory virus infection even during the epidemic of COVID-19 in Beijing. No single symptom or laboratory finding was suggestive of a specific respiratory virus; however, epidemic history was significant for the screening of COVID-19."

The study aim was to describe the etiological profile and clinical characteristics of pneumonia among children hospitalized in Thimphu, Bhutan.
Methods
This prospective study enrolled children aged 2–59 months admitted to the Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Referral Hospital with World Health Organization (WHO)-defined clinical pneumonia. Demographic and clinico-radiological data were collected through questionnaires, physical examination, and chest radiography. Blood samples and nasopharyngeal washing were collected for microbiological analysis including culture and molecular methods.
Results
From July 2017 to June 2018, 189 children were enrolled, of which 53.4% were infants. Pneumonia-related admissions were less frequent over the winter. Chest radiographies were obtained in 149 children; endpoints included pneumonia in 39 cases (26.2%), other infiltrates in 31 (20.8%), and were normal in 79 children (53.0%). Non-contaminated bacterial growth was detected in 8/152 (5.3%) blood cultures, with only two cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Viral detection in upper respiratory secretions was common, with at least one virus detected in 103/115 (89.6%). The three most-commonly isolated viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (52/115; 45.2%), rhinovirus (42/115; 36.5%), and human parainfluenza virus (19/115; 16.5%). A third of patients with viral infections showed mixed infections. Case fatality rate was 3.2% (6/189).
Conclusion
Respiratory viral infections predominated among this cohort of WHO-defined clinical pneumonia cases, whereas bacterial aetiologies were uncommon, highlighting the epidemiologic transition that Bhutan seems to have reached."

Influenza remains a crucial transmissible disease from community. We aim to identify risk factors associated with mortality among hospitalized patients with severe influenza.
Methods
We retrospectively reviewed medical records of adult patients with laboratory-confirmed severe influenza at a medical center between January 2016 and December 2018. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality.
Results
Totally 96 patients were enrolled, with 73 patients in the influenza A group and 23 in the influenza B group. Eighteen (18.8%) deaths occurred within 30 days of hospitalization, including 8 (11%) and 10 (43.5%) of each group. In multivariable Cox regression analysis, factors associated with mortality were underlying diseases of liver cirrhosis (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 3.94; 95% CI, 1.07–14.45) and rheumatologic diseases (AHR, 7.45; 95% CI, 2.34–23.69) and the diagnosis of influenza B (AHR, 4.33; 95% CI, 1.68–11.13).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of meropenem in terms of indication and continuation of treatment at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital (SQUH), Muscat, Oman.
Methods
A retrospective observational study, conducted by reviewing the medical records of 400 adults, admitted patients who received at least one dose of meropenem during the study period (January 2017 to September 2017). The analysis was performed using univariate statistics.
Results
Meropenem was prescribed empirically in 382/400 (96%) of the cases. The majority (315/361 (87%)) of the patients received the proper meropenem dose. The indication for meropenem was considered appropriate in only 196/400 (49%) of the cases. The continuation of treatment was evaluated according to culture and sensitivity results in 202 cases, out of which 112 (55%) were justified. Most of the inappropriate uses were seen in oncology and hematology cases (31/42 (74%) and 61/101 (60%), respectively) and among respiratory and urinary tract infections (126/155 (81%) and 40/46 (87%), respectively).
Conclusions
Approximately half of the meropenem orders at SQUH in Oman were inappropriate and unjustified by culture-test results. New strategies are needed to optimize the rational use of meropenem and to ensure appropriate de-escalation and discontinuation of meropenem whenever indicated."

To study the molecular epidemiology of clinical metallo-β-lactamase (MBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates in China and to evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility of MBL-Enterobacteriaceae isolates to aztreonam–avibactam.
Methods
Bacterial speciation was determined using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. PCR was used to screen for common carbapenemase genes. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of common clinical antibiotics and aztreonam–avibactam was performed using the standard broth microdilution method.
Results
A total of 161 MBL-Enterobacteriaceae isolates were included, with Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 73, 45.4%) and Escherichia coli (n = 53, 32.9%) being the most common species. Among the 161 isolates, blaNDM (n = 151), blaIMP (n = 13), and blaVIM (n = 2) were detected, including five strains (3.1%) co-harboring two MBLs. MBL-Enterobacteriaceae isolates frequently contained two (n = 55, 34.2%) or more (n = 89, 55.3%) additional serine β-lactamase genes (blaKPC, blaCTX-M, blaTEM, or blaSHV). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that 81.4% of isolates (n = 131) were resistant to aztreonam. The rates of resistance to cefazolin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ampicillin–sulbactam, amoxicillin–clavulanic acid, and piperacillin–tazobactam were all over 90%. The addition of avibactam (4 μg/ml) significantly reduced the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the aztreonam-resistant isolates by more than 8-fold (range ≤0.125 to 4 μg/ml), with a MIC50/MIC90 of ≤0.125/1 μg/ml among the 131 isolates. Overall, 96.9% (n = 156) of the total isolates were inhibited at an aztreonam–avibactam concentration of ≤1 μg/ml. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis found that in patients with MBL-Enterobacteriaceae infections, the presence of pre-existing lung disease (adjusted odds ratio 8.267, 95% confidence interval 1.925–28.297; p = 0.004) was associated with a hazard effect on worse disease outcomes.
Conclusions
The combined use of aztreonam–avibactam is highly potent against MBL-Enterobacteriaceae and may serve as a new candidate for the treatment of infections caused by MBL-Enterobacteriaceae in China."

127 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this study, and classified into non-severe and severe groups. Demographics, symptoms, underlying diseases and laboratory data were collected and assessed for predictive value.
Results
Of 127 COVID-19 patients, 16 cases (12.60%) were classified into the severe group. High level of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reaction protein (CRP) and hypertension were independent risk factors for the severity of COVID-19. The risk model based on IL-6, CRP and hypertension had the highest area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC). Additionally, the baseline IL-6 was positively correlated with other immune-inflammatory parameters and the dynamic change of IL-6 in the severe cases were parallel to the amelioration of the disease.
Conclusion
Our study showed that high level of IL-6, CRP and hypertension were independent risk factors for assessing the severity of COVID-19. The risk model established upon IL-6, CRP and hypertension had the highest predictability in this study. Besides, IL-6 played a pivotal role in the severity of COVID-19 and had a potential value for monitoring the process of severe cases."

To study the prevalence of fungal species in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients over a 16 years period. To examine the impact of Candida albicans (C. albicans), Candida dubliniensis (C. dubliniensis) and Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) on lung function.
Methods
Observational single-center cohort study (2000–2015) including 133 CF patients (ages 6–66 years). Linear mixed models with autoregressive covariance matrix were used.
Results
The most common fungus was C. albicans (prevalence 62%) followed by A. fumigatus (22%) and C. dubliniensis (11%). In the initial year of detection, there was no impact of C. albicans, C. dubliniensis or A. fumigatus on lung function. However, one and two years after detection of C. dubliniensis a reduction in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in the first second (ppFEV1) was observed of 3.8% (p = 0.022) and 4.1% (p = 0.017), respectively, compared with CF patients without these findings. Furthermore, patients with positive cultures for any of these fungal species for three consecutive years exhibited a decline in lung function: C. dubliniensis, 7.6% reduction in ppFEV1 (p = 0.001); A. fumigatus, 4.9% (p = 0.007); C. albicans, 2.6% (p = 0.014). The results were adjusted for age, CFTR genotype, chronic and intermittent P. aeruginosa colonization, and numbers of intravenous antibiotic treatments per year. Persistence of C. dubliniensis for three consecutive years was positively correlated to age and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (both p = 0.001).
Conclusions
Cystic fibrosis patients who were cultured positive for C. dubliniensis, C. albicans or A. fumigatus in sputum exhibited a decline in ppFEV1 over time. The effect was most pronounced for C. dubliniensis."

The outcomes of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection vary substantially among affected individuals, providing evidence of the role of host genetic background in the susceptibility to HBV persistence and the dynamics of liver injury progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Methods
Six single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the interleukin 10 gene (IL10) were genotyped by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in 857 patients with chronic HBV infection (CHB), 48 patients with resolved HBV infection, and 100 healthy volunteers. Associations of the selected polymorphisms with susceptibility to chronic HBV infection, liver injury progression, and outcomes were investigated.
Results
IL10 −819T (rs1800871), −592A (rs1800872), and +504T (rs3024490) alleles were associated with treatment-induced hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance. Additionally, IL10 ATAC haplotype increased the chance of HBsAg loss and was significantly more frequent in patients with less liver injury. Moreover rs1800871TT, rs1518110TT, rs1800872AA, and rs3024490TT genotypes were identified as predictors of a lower FIB-4 score (<0.5).

Methods
A comprehensive search of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention official websites and announcements was performed between 20 Jan 2019 and 29 Feb 2020. The relevant data of the distribution of the infection on each reported day were obtained.
Results& findings
Up to 29 Feb 2020, 79,824 confirmed cases with the COVID-19 including 66,907 in Hubei Province and 12,377 in other administrative regions were reported. The SARS-COV-2 showed faster epidemic trends compared with the 2003-SARS-CoV. A total of 2,870 deaths have been reported nationwide among 79,824 confirmed cases, with a mortality of 3.6%. The mortality of the COVID-19 was significantly higher in Hubei Province than that in other regions(4.1% versus 0.84%). Since 1 Feb 2020 the number of discharged cases exceeded the number of the dead. By 29 Feb 2020, the number of discharged patients was 41,625, which exceeded the number of hospitalized patients, and the trend has further increased.
Conclusions
The infection of the SARS-COV-2 is spreading and increasing nationwide, and Hubei Province is the main epidemic area, with higher mortality. The outbreak is now under initial control especially in other regions outside of Hubei Province. Due to the different epidemic characteristics between Hubei Province and other regions, we should focus on different prevention and control strategies."

The detection and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is a key step in eliminating tuberculosis (TB), but information on safety and on treatment interruption in elderly LTBI patients remains limited.
Methods
This multicenter prospective observational study included individuals with LTBI who underwent preventive therapy. Incidents of systemic adverse reactions (SARs) and treatment interruption rates in an elderly group (≥60 years old) and a young group (<60 years old) were analyzed.
Results
A total of 406 LTBI patients, comprising 167 elderly and 239 young patients, were included in the analyses. The incidence of SARs was similar in the elderly group (18%) and the young group (15.1%). Being middle-aged (35–59 years), body mass index <23 kg/m2, a regimen of 3 months of once-weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid, and end-stage renal disease were independent factors associated with SARs. The treatment interruption rate was similar between the elderly group (21.6%) and the young group (15.9%). LTBI patients aged ≥80 years with SARs had the highest risk of treatment interruption.
Conclusions
The occurrence of SARs was similar in the elderly (≥60 years old) and young (<60 years old) LTBI patients receiving preventive therapy. Extremely old (≥80 years old) LTBI patients had a higher treatment interruption rate, especially when they had SARs."

abstract = "Objective
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a COVID-19 pandemic on March 12, 2020. Several studies have indicated that densely populated urban environments and the heavy dependence on traffic could increase the potential spread of COVID-19. This study investigated the association between changes in traffic volume and the spread of COVID-19 in South Korea.
Methods
This study analyzed the daily national traffic and traffic trend for 3 months from January 1, 2020. Traffic data were measured using 6307 vehicle detection system (VDS). This study analyzed the difference in traffic levels between 2019 and 2020. Non-linear regression was performed to analyze the change in traffic trend in 2020. The relationship between traffic and confirmed COVID-19 cases was analyzed using single linear regression.
Results
The mean daily nationwide level of traffic for the first 3 months of 2020 was 143 655 563 vehicles, which was 9.7% lower than the same period in 2019 (159 044 566 vehicles). All regions showed a decreasing trend in traffic in February, which shifted to an increasing trend from March. In Incheon there was a positive, but insignificant, linear relationship between increasing numbers of newly confirmed cases and increasing traffic (β = 43 146; p = 0.056).
Conclusions
Numbers of newly confirmed COVID-19 patients have been decreasing since March, while the traffic has been increasing. The fact that traffic is increasing indicates greater contact between people, which in turn increases the risk of further COVID-19 spread. Therefore, the government will need to devise suitable policies, such as total social distancing."

abstract = "Background
In 2018, Zimbabwe declared another major cholera outbreak a decade after recording one of the worst cholera outbreaks in Africa.
Methods
A mathematical model for cholera was used to estimate the magnitude of the cholera outbreak and vaccination coverage using cholera cases reported data. A Markov chain Monte Carlo method based on a Bayesian framework was used to fit the model in order to estimate the basic reproductive number and required vaccination coverage for cholera control.
Results
The results showed that the outbreak had a basic reproductive number of 1.82 (95% credible interval [CrI] 1.53–2.11) and required vaccination coverage of at least 58% (95% Crl 45–68%) to be contained using an oral cholera vaccine of 78% efficacy. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that a vaccine with at least 55% efficacy was sufficient to contain the outbreak but at higher coverage of 75% (95% Crl 58–88%). However, high-efficacy vaccines would greatly reduce the required coverage, with 100% efficacy vaccine reducing coverage to 45% (95% Crl 35–53%).
Conclusions
These findings reinforce the crucial need for oral cholera vaccines to control cholera in Zimbabwe, considering that the decay of water reticulation and sewerage infrastructure is unlikely to be effectively addressed in the coming years."

Since January 23rd 2020, stringent measures for controlling the novel coronavirus epidemics have been gradually enforced and strengthened in mainland China. The detection and diagnosis have been improved as well. However, the daily reported cases staying in a high level make the epidemics trend prediction difficult.
Methods
Since the traditional SEIR model does not evaluate the effectiveness of control strategies, a novel model in line with the current epidemics process and control measures was proposed, utilizing multisource datasets including cumulative number of reported, death, quarantined and suspected cases.
Results
Results show that the trend of the epidemics mainly depends on quarantined and suspected cases. The predicted cumulative numbers of quarantined and suspected cases nearly reached static states and their inflection points have already been achieved, with the epidemics peak coming soon. The estimated effective reproduction numbers using model-free and model-based methods are decreasing, as well as new infections, while new reported cases are increasing. Most infected cases have been quarantined or put in suspected class, which has been ignored in existing models.
Conclusions
The uncertainty analyses reveal that the epidemics is still uncertain and it is important to continue enhancing the quarantine and isolation strategy and improving the detection rate in mainland China."

Given that the optimal antibiotic treatment duration for acute cholangitis with successful biliary drainage remains unknown, this study aimed to validate whether antibiotic treatment duration could be reduced to ≤3 days among patients presenting the same.
Methods
This retrospective study included patients who presented with mild to moderate acute cholangitis due to choledocholithiasis who had undergone successful biliary drainage through endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). After that, 30-day mortality rates and 3-month recurrence rates following short-course antibiotic treatment (SCT, ≤3 days) and long-course antibiotic treatment (LCT, ≥4 days) were compared.
Results
A total of 96 patients were analyzed, among whom 22 (22.9%) received SCT, and 74 (77.1%) received LCT. The SCT and LCT groups had a median antibiotic treatment duration of 1.5 (range 1–3) and seven (range 4–17) days, respectively. Moreover, the SCT and LCT groups exhibited no significant differences in cholangitis grades, 30-day mortality rates (0%, 0/22 and 2.7%, 2/74, respectively), 3-month recurrence rates, length of hospitalization, and acute bacteremic cholangitis rates.

To reduce childhood mortality from severe malaria by implementing the World Health Organization's standardized malarial treatment protocol.
Design
Observational study comparing the mortality rate from malaria before and after the intervention.
Setting
Inpatient pediatric ward in a district referral hospital of Sierra Leone.
Participants
A total of 1298 pediatric patients (ages 0-13 years, male and female) received the intervention, representing 100% of the pediatric patients admitted with severe malaria during the dates of implementation (there were no exclusion criteria).
Interventions
We implemented the World Health Organization's standardized malarial protocol on September 30, 2015. Based on monthly run reports of mortality and root cause analysis, we adapted the malaria protocol by adding sublingual glucose as a treatment to target hypoglycemia complications in March 2016.
Main Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was a change in monthly percent mortality from severe malaria, and the secondary outcome was the percent of mortality attributed to hypoglycemia.
Results
The monthly average percent mortality from severe malaria dropped from 9% to 3.6% after the intervention, which was borderline statistically significant (p 0.06, CI 95% 1.5 to 5.6). The secondary outcome, percent of malarial deaths attributable to hypoglycemia via chart reviews, dropped from 83% to 44% across the study period. There was an increase in the average number of admissions for severe malaria from 71 to 153 children per month in the second half of the year (range from 49-212 per month).
Conclusion
Implementing the WHO malaria treatment protocol with bedside tracking of protocol steps reduced malaria mortality and improved our ward's efficiency without adding any human or medical resources."

We recruited 73 patients with COVID-19 [49 men and 24 women; average age: 58.36 years (SD: 14.31)] admitted to the intensive care unit of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from December 30, 2019 to February 16, 2020. Demographics, underlying diseases, and laboratory test results on admission were collected and analyzed. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.
Results
The non-survivors were older (65.46 [SD 9.74]vs 46.23 [12.01]) and were more likely to have chronic medical illnesses. Non-survivors tend to develop more severe lymphopenia, with higher C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, D-dimer, and hs-Troponin I(hs-TnI) levels. Patients with elevated hs-TnI levels on admission had shorter duration from symptom onset to death. Increased hs-TnI level was related to dismal prognosis. Death risk increased by 20.8% when the hs-TnI level increased by one unit. After adjusting for inflammatory or coagulation index, the independent predictive relationship between hs-TnI and death disappeared.
Conclusions
Cardiac injury may occur at the early stage of COVID-19, which is associated with high mortality. Inflammatory factor cascade and coagulation abnormality may be the potential mechanisms of COVID-19 combined with cardiac injury."

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the causative agent for Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), one of the most common cancers in Tanzania. We have investigated KSHV prevalence and factors associated with KSHV infection in Tanzania.
Methods
This is a cross-sectional study of voluntary blood-donors from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Plasma was screened for KSHV, HIV-1, HBV, HCV and Treponema pallidum (syphilis). Associations between KSHV sero-status and risk factors were analyzed. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported to evaluate risk factors of KSHV infection. All tests were 2-tailed, and P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
The overall KSHV seroprevalence was 56.9%. Significantly increased risk of KSHV infection was detected in persons from the Lake and Central Zones (OR=6.4, 95% CI=1.6–25.3, P=0.008 and OR=5.7, 95% CI=1.0–32.5, P=0.048 respectively). A trend toward increased risk of KSHV infection with HIV-1 co-infection was not significant (OR=2.8, 95% CI=1.0–8.0, P=0.06). Seroreactivity to T. pallidum was surprisingly high (14.9%).

The outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has currently become a global concern. The generations of the epidemic spread are not well known, yet these are critical parameters to facilitate an understanding of the epidemic. A seafood wholesale market and Wuhan city, China, were recognized as the primary and secondary epidemic sources. Human movements nationwide from the two epidemic sources revealed the characteristics of the first-generation and second-generation spreads of the COVID-19 epidemic, as well as the potential third-generation spread.
Methods
We used spatiotemporal data of COVID-19 cases in mainland China and two categories of location-based service (LBS) data of mobile devices from the primary and secondary epidemic sources to calculate Pearson correlation coefficient,r, and spatial stratified heterogeneity, q, statistics.
Results
Two categories of device trajectories had generally significant correlations and determinant powers of the epidemic spread. Bothr and q statistics decreased with distance from the epidemic sources and their associations changed with time. At the beginning of the epidemic, the mixed first-generation and second-generation spreads appeared in most cities with confirmed cases. They strongly interacted to enhance the epidemic in Hubei province and the trend was also significant in the provinces adjacent to Hubei. The third-generation spread started in Wuhan from January 17–20, 2020, and in Hubei from January 23–24. No obvious third-generation spread was detected outside Hubei.
Conclusions
The findings provide important foundations to quantify the effect of human movement on epidemic spread and inform ongoing control strategies. The spatiotemporal association between the epidemic spread and human movements from the primary and secondary epidemic sources indicates a transfer from second to third generations of the infection. Urgent control measures include preventing the potential third-generation spread in mainland China, eliminating it in Hubei, and reducing the interaction influence of first-generation and second-generation spreads."

As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to proliferate globally, this paper shares the findings of modelling the outbreak in China at both provincial and national levels. This paper examines the applicability of the logistic growth model, with implications for the study of the COVID-19 pandemic and other infectious diseases.
Methods
An NLS (Non-Linear Least Squares) method was employed to estimate the parameters of a differentiated logistic growth function using new daily COVID-19 cases in multiple regions in China and in other selected countries. The estimation was based upon training data from January 20, 2020 to March 13, 2020. A restriction test was subsequently implemented to examine whether a designated parameter was identical among regions or countries, and the diagnosis of residuals was also conducted. The model's goodness of fit was checked using testing data from March 14, 2020 to April 18, 2020.
Results
The model presented in this paper fitted time-series data exceedingly well for the whole of China, its eleven selected provinces and municipalities, and two other countries - South Korea and Iran - and provided estimates of key parameters. This study rejected the null hypothesis that the growth rates of outbreaks were the same among ten selected non-Hubei provinces in China, as well as between South Korea and Iran. The study found that the model did not provide reliable estimates for countries that were in the early stages of outbreaks. Furthermore, this study concured that the R2 values might vary and mislead when compared between different portions of the same non-linear curve. In addition, the study identified the existence of heteroskedasticity and positive serial correlation within residuals in some provinces and countries.
Conclusions
The findings suggest that there is potential for this model to contribute to better public health policy in combatting COVID-19. The model does so by providing a simple logistic framework for retrospectively analyzing outbreaks in regions that have already experienced a maximal proliferation in cases. Based upon statistical findings, this study also outlines certain challenges in modelling and their implications for the results."

The goal of this study was to establish the seroprevalence of positive antibodies against varicella and compliance with varicella vaccination in the pre-vaccination era.
Methods
A cohort of 10 683 Italian students from Padua University Medical School (from 2004 to 2019) were enrolled and classified as unvaccinated, vaccinated once, or vaccinated twice against varicella, according to their vaccination certificate. The antibody titre was measured and the seroprevalence of positive subjects was determined. Subjects with negative or equivocal antibodies were invited for vaccination, and then the antibody titre was retested.
Results
Unvaccinated students were mostly seropositive (95.6%), compared with vaccinated students who were less seropositive (68.0% after one dose and 78.6% after two doses) and had significantly lower antibody titres (p < 0.0001). The post-test vaccination had a positive response rate of 85.4%: 67.4% after one dose and 91.4% after two doses.
Conclusions
In the pre-vaccination era, only 3.3% of future healthcare workers were vaccinated against varicella (1.1% once and 2.2% twice). Vaccination or revaccination of negative and equivocal individuals could reduce the number of susceptible people. Implementation of varicella vaccine (two doses) in healthcare workers is of primary importance to reduce the risk of transmission."

Methods
We conducted a review of medical records and EVD investigation reports from three districts in Sierra Leone. We report the clinical presentations and maternal and fetal outcomes of six pregnant women with atypical EVD, and subsequent transmission events from perinatal care.
Results
The six women (ages 18–38) were all in the third trimester. Each presented with signs and symptoms initially attributed to pregnancy. None met EVD case definition; only one was known at presentation to be a contact of an EVD case. Five women died, and all six fetuses/neonates died. These cases resulted in at least 35 additional EVD cases.
Conclusions
These cases add to the sparse literature focusing on pregnant women with EVD, highlighting challenges and implications for outbreak control. Infected newborns may also present atypically and may shed virus while apparently asymptomatic. Pregnant women identified a priori as contacts of EVD cases require special attention and planning for obstetrical care."

To determine the seroprevalence of antibodies against of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis among Thai adolescents.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted among Thai adolescents aged 11–20 years who had completed five doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP)-containing vaccine during childhood, either diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, whole-cell pertussis (DTwP) or diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine. Protective antibodies against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis were defined as anti-diphtheria toxoid IgG ≥0.1 IU/ml, anti-tetanus toxoid IgG ≥0.1 IU/ml, and anti-Bordetella pertussis toxin IgG ≥5 IU/ml, respectively.
Results
Of 220 adolescents (median age 16 years), 45% had received a tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid (Td) booster vaccine during adolescence, and none (0%) had received a tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, acellular pertussis (Tdap) booster vaccine. Overall, 50%, 99%, and 57% of adolescents demonstrated protective antibodies against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, respectively. The geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) of antibodies against diphtheria (p = 0.06) and tetanus (p < 0.001) were higher among adolescents who had received Td vaccine. Nevertheless, the antibody levels against both diseases waned over time, regardless of Td booster vaccination. Likewise, pertussis antibody levels gradually declined after the fifth childhood dose of DTwP/DTaP vaccine.
Conclusions
Approximately half of these healthy Thai adolescents had not maintained protective antibodies against diphtheria and pertussis. A booster vaccination with diphtheria toxoid and/or acellular pertussis-containing vaccines is a crucial strategy to prevent such diseases in this population."

Of 142 patients enrolled 68% (n=96/142, 95% confidence interval (CI) [60–75%]) were HIV-positive, 41% (n=39/96, 95% CI [31–50%]) of whom were ART-naïve. Among HIV-positive patients, both opportunistic pathogens (TB LAM-positivity, 36%, 95% CI [24–48%]; CrAg-positivity, 15%, 95% CI [7–23%]) and severe non-AIDS infections (S. pneumoniae urine antigen-positivity 12%, 95% CI [4–20%]; bacteraemia 17% (n=16/96, 95% CI [9–24%]), of which 56% (n=9/16, 95% CI [30–80%]) were gram-negative organisms) were common. Klebsiella pneumoniae recovered from blood and urine was uniformly resistant to ceftriaxone, as were most Escherichia coli isolates. Acknowledging the power limitations of our study, we conclude that relative to HIV-negative patients, HIV-positive patients had modestly higher 30-day mortality (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.88, 95% CI [0.78–4.55]; p=0.16, and 3.59, 95% CI [1.27–10.16], p=0.02) among those with and without viral suppression, respectively.
Conclusion
Rapid point-of-care assays provide substantial clinically actionable information in the setting of suspected sepsis, even in areas with high ART coverage. Antimicrobial resistance to first-line antibiotics in high burden settings is a growing threat."

We hypothesized that immune response may contribute to progression of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) at the second week of illness. Therefore, we compared cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses between severe and mild COVID-19 cases.
Methods
We examined peripheral blood mononuclear cells of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients from their first and third weeks of illness. Severe pneumonia was defined as an oxygen saturation ≤93% at room air. Expressions of molecules related to T-cell activation and functions were analyzed by flow cytometry.
Results
The population dynamics of T cells at the first week were not different between the two groups. However, total numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells tended to be lower in the severe group at the third week of illness. Expressions of Ki-67, PD-1, perforin, and granzyme B in CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were significantly higher in the severe group than in the mild group at the third week. In contrast to the mild group, the levels of their expression did not decrease in the severe group.
Conclusions
Severe COVID-19 had a higher degree of proliferation, activation, and cytotoxicity of T-cells at the late phase of illness without cytotoxic T-cell contraction, which might contribute to the development of severe COVID-19."

Parasitic infections of the eye are a major cause of ocular-surface diseases globally. While most infections are treatable, parasites can cause varying levels of damage mostly due to late diagnosis or misdiagnosis as a result of doctors’ unfamiliarity with their characteristics of latency and crypsis, as well as lack of awareness by the patients.
Case Reports
In this study, we present three cases of phthiriasis palpebrarum, thelaziasis, and ophthalmomyiasis, respectively. Two of the cases were treated at the clinic and did not recur. One patient refused treatment and was lost to follow-up.
Discussion
By evaluating the natural histories, morphology, symptoms, clinical findings, and treatment of these parasitic diseases, we systematically analyzed several distinct and unique parasite characteristics, especially latency and crypsis. Furthermore, we have proposed specific examination techniques and methods as well as prevention and treatment strategies from these specific perspectives, aiming to prompt timely diagnoses and early interventions for these diseases by health care workers and improve the public’s awareness of parasitic infections.
Conclusion
Parasitosis on the ocular surface is a global infectious disease, and prevention strategies include maintaining personal and environmental hygiene and limiting contact with animals. We recommend that health care workers should enhance their ability to detect and diagnose these diseases while promoting the public’s awareness of them in the context of our new perspectives."

Pertussis is a debilitating vaccine-preventable infection. The aim of this study was to determine susceptibility and exposure to pertussis in Lao PDR in different age groups and subpopulations.
Methods
A total 3072 serum samples were obtained from different cohorts: children with documented vaccination, pre-schoolers, schoolchildren, blood donors, healthcare workers (HCWs), and pregnant women and paired cord blood. Samples were tested for anti-pertussis toxin IgG antibodies. A history of Bordetella pertussis exposure was defined according to antibody titres. Four hundred and seventy-five throat swabs and nasopharyngeal aspirates were analysed by PCR for the presence of B. pertussis in symptomatic children at the Children's Hospital in Vientiane.
Results
Overall pertussis seroprevalence was 57.5%. The prevalence of titres indicating acute infection or recent vaccination or infection/vaccination within the last 12 months ranged from 7.4% (100/1356) in adults to 21.4% (25/117) in pre-schoolers (age 1–5 years). B. pertussis was detected in 1.05% (5/475) of children with respiratory symptoms in Vientiane Capital.
Conclusions
It is suggested that routine childhood vaccination, in particular outreach, as well as vaccination of HCWs should be strengthened. A childhood booster and vaccination of pregnant mothers should be considered. There is also a need to improve reporting and to introduce pertussis testing in at least one central facility."

Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is now a more curable disease with new direct acting antivirals (DAA). Although high sustained virologic response rates, failures still occur in DAA regimens. Our objective in this study was to characterize the real-life presence of clinically relevant resistance – associated substitutions (RASs) in the HCV NS5A gene in CHC patients whose DAA regimen has failed.
Methods
The study enrolled 53 CHC patients who experienced failure with DAA regimen as the prospective longitudinal cohort between 2017–2019. Genotypic resistance testing was performed via the viral population sequencing method and The Geno2pheno HCV tool was used for RAS analysis.
Results
The most frequent failure category was relapse (88%) followed by non-responder (12%). For a total of 36% of patients, RASs was detected in NS5A, Y93H was the most detected RAS in GT1b infected patients (89%).
Conclusions
This study establishes an HCV failure registry for Turkey in which samples were combined with clinical, virologic and molecular data of adult patients whose DAA therapy failed. RASs can occur in CHC patients with DAA treatment failures. Evaluation of RAS after DAA failure is very important before re-treatment is initiated to prevent virologic failure."

A selective literature review was performed concerning the influence on safety, immunogenicity, and effectiveness of mixing wP- and aP-containing vaccines for primary immunization of infants. In addition, local data were collected from various countries and the results discussed in a face-to-face meeting. Very few data addressing issues of mixing combination vaccines were identified, and no data were available concerning the effectiveness or duration of protection. It was also found that pharmacovigilance data are scarce or lacking in those countries where they would be needed the most. We then identified frequent problems occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where both vaccine types are used. Relying on local knowledge, we give practical recommendations for a variety of situations in different settings. Specific needs for additional data addressing these issues were also identified. International bodies, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as vaccine producers should try to find ways to highlight the problems of mixing wP- and aP-containing combination vaccines with robust data. Countries are urged to improve on their pharmacovigilance for vaccines. For practicing physicians, our recommendations offer guidance when wP- and aP-containing vaccines are used in parallel during primary immunization."

COVID-19 is spreading globally. This study aims to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women confirmed with COVID-19 to provide reference for clinical work.
Methods
The clinical features and outcomes of 10 pregnant women confirmed with COVID-19 at Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Hubei Province, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, a tertiary- care teaching hospital in Hubei province, Wuhan, China from January 23 to February 23, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed.
Results
All the 10 observed pregnant women including 9 singletons and 1 twin were native people in Wuhan. All of them were diagnosed mild COVID-19, and none of the patients developed severe COVID-19 or died. Among the 10 patients, two patients underwent vaginal delivery, two patients underwent intrapartum cesarean section, and the remaining six patients underwent elective cesarean section. All of 10 patients showed lung abnormalities by pulmonary CT images after delivery. Their eleven newborns were recorded and no neonatal asphyxia was observed.
Conclusions
Pulmonary CT screening on admission may be necessary to reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 during the outbreak period. And COVID-19 is not an indication of cesarean section."

To report the cost-effectiveness of Xpert in detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) through a comprehensive systematic review.
Methods
Specialized bibliographic databases were searched. Study quality was evaluated by commonly-used industry standards. Due to heterogeneity, evidences were synthesized narratively.
Results
Four studies from intermediate-to-low tuberculosis (TB)-burdern areas and 17 studies from high-TB-burden areas were included. Smear microscopy, clinical diagnosis and chest radiography were mostly used for comparison. Cost elements varied considerably depending on the perspectives. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses were used by seven and fourteen studies, respectively. All studies were of high quality (CHEERS score of 78.4 and QHES score of 86.9). Average cost per test was 29.8 US$ for Xpert compared with 3.83 US$ for smear microscopy. Cost-effectiveness analyses mostly supported application of Xpert into areas under varying TB burdens.
Conclusions
Xpert seems cost-effective under respective willingness-to-pay thresholds in nations with differences in socioeconomy, HIV stress and geographical distribution. Nevertheless, policymakers will benefit from localized studies since regional economic/financial statuses and health-care system should also be considered apart from the reports of cost-effectiveness."

Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan in December 2019, by March 10, 2020, a total of 80,932 confirmed cases have been reported in China. Two consecutively negative RT-PCR test results in respiratory tract specimens is required for the evaluation of discharge from hospital, and oropharyngeal swabs were the most common sample. However, false negative results occurred in the late stage of hospitalization, and avoiding false negative result is critical essential.
Methods
We reviewed the medical record of 353 patients who received tests with both specimens simultaneously, and compared the performance between nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs.
Results
Of the 353 patients (outpatients, 192; inpatients, 161) studied, the median age was 54 years, and 177 (50.1%) were women. Higher positive rate (positive tests/total tests) was observed in nasopharyngeal swabs than oropharyngeal swabs, especially in inpatients. Nasopharyngeal swabs from inpatients showed higher positive rate than outpatients. Nasopharyngeal swabs from male showed higher positive rate than female, especially in outpatients. Detection with both specimens slightly increased the positive rate than nasopharyngeal swab only. Moreover, the consistency between from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were poor (Kappa=0.308).
Conclusion
In conclusion, our study suggests that nasopharyngeal swabs may be more suitable than oropharyngeal swab at this stage of COVID-19 outbreak."

To control epidemics, sites more affected by mortality should be identified.
Methods
Defining epidemic nodes as areas that included both most fatalities per time unit and connections, such as highways, geo-temporal Chinese data on the COVID-19 epidemic were investigated with linear, logarithmic, power, growth, exponential, and logistic regression models. A z-test compared the slopes observed.
Results
Twenty provinces suspected to act as epidemic nodes were empirically investigated. Five provinces displayed synchronicity, long-distance connections, directionality and assortativity – network properties that helped discriminate epidemic nodes. The rank I node included most fatalities and was activated first. Fewer deaths were reported, later, by rank II and III nodes, while the data from rank I–III nodes exhibited slopes, the data from the remaining provinces did not. The power curve was the best fitting model for all slopes. Because all pairs (rank I vs. rank II, rank I vs. rank III, and rank II vs. rank III) of epidemic nodes differed statistically, rank I–III epidemic nodes were geo-temporally and statistically distinguishable.
Conclusions
The geo-temporal progression of epidemics seems to be highly structured. Epidemic network properties can distinguish regions that differ in mortality. This real-time geo-referenced analysis can inform both decision-makers and clinicians."

Bhutan suffers from a high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and gastric cancer-related mortality. In preparation for a countrywide H. pylori eradication program, the antibiotic resistance patterns of H. pylori infection were surveyed in different geographical regions.
Methods
Dyspeptic patients in 6 districts including Thimphu, Punakha, Wangdue, Trongsa, Bumthang, and Haa underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy during GASTROCAMP and were enrolled between December 2010 and April 2015. Gastric biopsies were obtained for rapid urease test, histopathology, and H. pylori culture. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was later performed if the culture was positive.
Results
A total of 1178 patients were surveyed. The overall H. pylori infection in Bhutan was 66.2%. Punakha had the highest prevalence of H. pylori infection (85.6%). Thimphu and Punakha (city areas) had higher prevalence of H. pylori infection than rural districts (73.5% vs 63.3%, OR=1.61, 95% CI 1.22–2.13, p=0.0008). There were 357 patients (30.3%) with positive H. pylori culture completed antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The mean age was 40.5 years with female predominance (57.1%). No amoxicillin resistant strains were found. Metronidazole resistance was 81% followed by levofloxacin resistance (8.1%). Clarithromycin (2%) and tetracycline (0.6%) resistance was rare except in Thimphu, the capital city (10%) vs 0% in rural areas, p<0.001. The metronidazole resistance rate remained stable at approximately 80% during the past 5 years of study. Levofloxacin-resistant strains gradually rose from 5.3% in 2010 to 9.9% in 2015.
Conclusions
Bhutan had a high prevalence of H. pylori infection. Metronidazole resistance was extremely high, whereas clarithromycin resistance was quite low in this specific area. Antibiotic resistance pattern could be good evidence for guiding a proper treatment regimen for H. pylori infection in Bhutan."

abstract = "Objectives
Dengue caused by infection with the dengue virus (DENV) is endemic in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world and of greatest public health concern. With more large outbreaks in rural areas, the purpose of this study was to develop a point-of-care test using recombinase-aided amplification and lateral-flow dipsticks for rapidly detecting DENV in low-resource settings.
Methods
The primers for the recombinase-aided amplification (RAA) assay were designed based on 3’ UTR of the DENV genome and screened. The RAA temperature, time and the concentration of primers were then optimized, as well as the lateral-flow dipstick assay (LFD) time. Finally, the diagnostic performance of the reverse transcription (RT)-RAA-LFD assay was evaluated using blood samples from 247 patients who were clinically suspected to be infected with DENV.
Results
The RAA primer pair F1/R2 was the optimal combination for detecting DENV. The RT-RAA was performed in an incubator block at 37°C for 20minutes, and the amplicons were visible in the flow dipsticks from a naked eye within 3minutes. The detection limit of the developed RT-RAA-LFD assay was 10 copies/μL with high specificity for DENV. Compared with commercial reverse transcription quantitative PCR assay, the kappa value of RT-RAA-LFD in the 247 clinical samples was 0.957.
Conclusions
In this study, a rapid and visual point-of-care test based on RT-RAA and LFD assay was developed. It was found to be suitable for reliable detection of DENV in low-resource settings with limited laboratory capabilities and optimal storage conditions."

Malaria cross-sectional surveys are rarely conducted in very low transmission settings. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of Plasmodium infection in a near-elimination setting in southern Thailand.
Methods
Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted in areas of active transmission in the Surat Thani province of Thailand in January and May 2019. PCR was used to detect Plasmodium infection.
Results
The prevalence of Plasmodium blood infection was 0.45% and 0.61% in January and May 2019, respectively. The major parasite species was Plasmodium falciparum in January and Plasmodium vivax in May. Unexpectedly, Plasmodium knowlesi infections were also detected. Most infections, including those of Plasmodium knowlesi, were asymptomatic. Being male and staying outdoors at night-time were the only significant identified risk factors. Of people infected in January 28.0% were positive in May for the same parasite species, suggesting persistent asymptomatic infections.
Conclusions
Despite the very low incidence rate in Surat Thani, most malaria infections were asymptomatic. Outdoor mosquito biting at night-time is likely an important mode of malaria transmission. Unexpectedly, asymptomatic Plasmodium knowlesi infection was found, confirming previous reports of such infection in mainland Southeast Asia."

Studies on the etiology of respiratory infections among children in Qatar and surrounding countries are limited.
Objectives
To describe the prevalence and seasonality of RSV, influenza, and other respiratory pathogens among children in Qatar.
Methods
We retrospectively collected and analyzed data of 33,404 children (<15 years) presented with influenza-like illness from 2012 to 2017.
Results
At least one respiratory pathogen was detected in 26,138 (78%) of patients. Together, human rhinoviruses (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and influenza viruses comprised nearly two-thirds of all cases, affecting 24%, 19.7%, and 18.5%, respectively. A prevalence of 5-10% was recorded for adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), human bocavirus (HboV), and human coronaviruses (HCoVs). Human metapneumovirus (HMPV), enteroviruses, M. pneumonia, and parechovirus had prevalences below 5%. While RSV, influenza, and HMPV exhibited strong seasonal activity in the winter, HRV was active during low RSV and influenza circulation. The burden of RSV exceeds that of influenza among young age groups, whereas influenza correlated positively with age. Further, HRV, adenovirus, influenza, and RSV infection rates varied significantly between male and females.
Conclusion
This comprehensive multi-year study provides insights into the etiology of ILI among children in Qatar, which represents the Gulf region. Our results reinforce the significance of active surveillance of respiratory pathogens to improve infection prevention and control strategies, particularly among children."

abstract = "Objectives
Once symptoms appear, rabies is almost always fatal and accounts for 200–300 deaths annually in the Philippines. Available rabies vaccines can be administered either in pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) or post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). After exposure, PrEP-immunized individuals require fewer doses of PEP and no rabies immunoglobulin.
Methods
A static decision-tree model was developed to assess cost-effectiveness of a PrEP+PEP program vs PEP alone. Philippines-specific data for people seeking medical advice at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine between July 2015 and June 2016 were used in the model, together with data from published literature.
Results
Over a 20-year period, in a cohort of 1 million 5-year-old children in the Philippines, PrEP+PEP was expected to prevent 297 deaths compared with PEP alone. From both payer and societal perspectives, the resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were 36 035 (US$759; 2016 US$ conversion) and 18 663 (US$393) Philippine Pesos (PHP) — quality-adjusted life-years gained — respectively, which are both below the willingness-to-pay threshold of PHP140 255 (US$2 953).
Conclusion
These data suggest that a universal PrEP program targeting 5-year-olds would be cost-effective in the Philippines."

Different countries have adopted different containment and testing strategies for SARS-CoV-2. The difference in testing makes it difficult to compare the effect of different containment strategies. This study proposes methods to allow a direct comparison and presents the results.
Design
Publicly available data on the numbers of reported COVID-19-related deaths between 01 January and 17 April 2020 were compared between countries.
Results
The numbers of cases or deaths per 100,000 inhabitants gave severely biased comparisons between countries. Only the number of deaths expressed as a percentage of the number of deaths on day 25 after the first reported COVID-19-related death allowed a direct comparison between countries. From this comparison clear differences were observed between countries, associated with the timing of the implementation of containment measures.
Conclusions
Comparisons between countries are only possible when simultaneously taking into account that the virus does not arrive in all countries simultaneously, absolute numbers are incomparable due to different population sizes, rates per 100,000 of the population are incomparable because not all countries are affected homogeneously, susceptibility to death by COVID-19 can differ between populations, and a death is only reported as a COVID-19-related death if the patient was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. With the current methods, all these factors were accounted for and an unbiased direct comparison between countries was established. This comparison confirmed that early adoption of containment strategies is key in flattening the curve of the epidemic."

Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing (mNGS) has been applied as a novel method of detection pathogens for infectious diseases, but its value in the rapid diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis(TBM)has not been clarified based on large samples.
Methods
A retrospective analysis was conducted on 51 inpatients with suspected TBM who underwent mNGS and four other tests in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
Results
Among 51 included patients, 45 cases were diagnosed as TBM (38 definite, 5 probable, 2 possible) and 6 cases as non-TBM. Using final diagnosis as reference standard, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV (positive predictive value), and NPV (negative predictive value) of mNGS in CSF for TBM were 84.44%(38/45, 69.94%–93.01%), 100%(6/6, 51.68%–100%), 100%(40/40, 88.57%–100%) and 46.15%(6/13, 20.40%–73.88%). The diagnostic sensitivity of mNGS(84.4%)was significantly higher than that of AFB (0%, P = 0.000), MGIT960 culture(22.2%, P = 0.000), MTB PCR(24.4%, P = 0.000) and Xpert MTB/RIF(40%, P = 0.000). The ROC curve showed that CSF protein quantification and CSF cell count might be valuable in the prediction of NGS positive detection of MTB (Mycobacterium tuberculosis).
Conclusion
CSF mNGS had high sensitivity, specificity and PPV in the diagnosis of TBM. Patients with a significant increase in CSF cell number and protein quantification might have a higher likelihood of positive MTB detection of NGS."

To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of introducing a domestic pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7-TT) into the Cuban National Immunization Program (NIP).
Methods
We compared PCV7-TT given at two, four and six months of age to a scenario without PCV7-TT, over a ten-year period (2020–2029). We calculated the cost (Cuban pesos – CUP) per Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) averted from a Government perspective. We compared results from a static cohort model and a parsimonious prediction model informed by the serotype distribution among pneumococcal carriers and cases. We ran probabilistic and deterministic uncertainty analyses.
Results
PCV7-TT could prevent 6897 (95% uncertainty interval, 4344–8750) hospitalizations and 189 (115–253) deaths in children <5 years of age, over the period 2020–2029. This could cost around 25 million (20–31) discounted CUP but would be offset by treatment cost savings of around 23 million (14–31). A parsimonious model predicted less favourable impact and cost-effectiveness but the cost per DALY averted was still less than 0.4 times the current GDP per capita.
Conclusions
PCV7-TT is likely to be cost-effective in Cuba. The impact of the vaccine would need to be carefully monitored following its introduction into the NIP."

Methods
We assessed the lymphocyte subset populations and other clinical parameters of septic patients upon intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and evaluated their potential impact on CRE infection diagnosis and outcome.
Results
Among 373 septic patients, 51 were diagnosed with CRE infection. The 28-day mortality was significantly higher in CRE than non-CRE patients (35.3% vs 14.9%). The T lymphocyte count and CD4+CD28+ T cell count were both independent risk factors for CRE infection, with the latter had the best diagnostic ability (AUC: 0.908; p < 0.0001). Lower CD4+CD28+ T cell counts were associated with higher likelihoods of CRE infection. The CRE incidence and 28-day mortality of CRE-infected patients could be predicted using cutoff values of 242 (sensitivity: 83.9%; specificity: 87.5%) and 58.5 (sensitivity: 100%; specificity: 61.1%) CD4+CD28+ T cells/μl at ICU admission, respectively.
Conclusions
Septic patients with CRE infection had higher 28-day mortality. Given that the CD4+CD28+ T cell count was significantly lower in CRE than non-CRE septic patients and a lower cell count was significantly associated with higher 28-day mortality, CD4+CD28+ T cell counts may be useful markers for early diagnosis of CRE infection and outcome prediction."

During the 2013–2016 period, Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika affected more than 1 million people in Colombia. These arboviruses and their chronic manifestations pose a public health challenge. Therefore, we estimated the burden of disease by Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika in Colombia between 2013 and 2016.
Methods
An exploratory ecological study was carried out using the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) as a unit of measure. The mortality databases of the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) and the morbidity databases of the National Public Health Surveillance System (SIVIGILA) were used. Deaths and cases for each arbovirus were grouped and then adjusted to control biases. Subsequently, we performed a sensitivity analysis.
Results
In the 2013–2016 period, 491,629.2 DALYs were lost due to arboviruses in Colombia. By disease, 26.6% of the total DALYs were caused by Dengue, 71.3% by Chikungunya, and the remaining 2.2%, by Zika. The majority of DALYs (68.2%) were caused by chronic complications. Five out of 32 departments (Valle del Cauca, Tolima, Norte de Santander, Huila, and Bolívar) contributed 50.5% of total DALYs.

Participants were asked how often they implemented the five personal protective measures recommended by the World Health Organization (hand hygiene, social distancing, avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth, respiratory etiquette, and self-isolation) in the baseline and follow-up surveys.
Results
Three of the five personal protective measures’ availability significantly improved during the community transmission phase compared to the early phase. Social distancing measures showed significant improvement, from 67.4% to 82.2%. However, the prevalence of avoiding touching the eyes, nose, and mouth, which had the lowest prevalence in the early phase, showed no significant improvement (approximately 60%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that men and persons of low-income households made fewer improvements than women and persons of high-income households.

Methods
Blood and nasopharyngeal swab specimens were taken from children and adults with fever (>37.5 °C) or history of fever (<14 days) in Thailand and Myanmar.
Results
Of 773 patients with at least one blood or nasopharyngeal swab specimen collected, 227 (29.4%) had a target organism detected. Influenza virus type A was detected in 85/227 cases (37.5%), followed by dengue virus (30 cases, 13.2%), respiratory syncytial virus (24 cases, 10.6%) and Leptospira spp. (nine cases, 4.0%). Clinical outcomes were similar between patients with a bacterial or a viral organism, regardless of antibiotic prescription.

Conclusions
Serious bacterial infections requiring antibiotics are an exception rather than the rule in the first line of care.

Materials and methods
A community-based matched case–control study was conducted, involving 139 cases and 278 controls under 5 years of age, from mid-January to mid-February 2019. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Bivariate and multivariable conditional logistic regression analyses were performed. From the multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis, variables with a significance level of p < 0.05 were taken as significantly associated with ARI among under-five children.
Result
ARI among children under 5 years of age was significantly associated with age of the mother/caregiver being ≥35 years, occupation of mother/caregiver being housewife, the family being of medium wealth status, the type of stove used in the house, carrying the child while preparing food, absence of windows in the house, and nutritional status of the child.

abstract = "Objectives
Public health officials need tools to assist in anticipating the healthcare resources required to confront the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. We constructed a modeling tool to aid active public health officials to estimate healthcare demand from the pandemic in their jurisdictions and to evaluate the potential impact of population-wide social-distancing interventions.
Methods
The tool uses an SEIR compartmental model to project the pandemic’s local spread. Users input case counts, healthcare resources, and select intervention strategies to evaluate. Outputs include the number of infections and deaths with and without intervention, and the demand for hospital and critical care beds and ventilators relative to existing capacity. We illustrate the tool using data from three regions of Chile.
Results
Our scenarios indicate a surge in COVID-19 patients could overwhelm Chilean hospitals by June, peaking in July or August at six to 50 times the current supply of beds and ventilators. A lockdown strategy or combination of case isolation, home quarantine, social distancing of individuals >70 years, and telework interventions may keep treatment demand below capacity.
Conclusions
Aggressive interventions can avert substantial morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. Our tool permits rapid evaluation of locally-applicable policy scenarios and updating of results as new data become available."

abstract = "Background
Prison populations are at high risk for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence, incidence, HBV associated factors and circulating genotypes/subtypes.
Methods
A total of 3,368 prisoners from 12 closed prisons were randomly recruited for a cross-sectional study. In addition, a cohort study was conducted 12 months later and included 1,656 individuals. Participants underwent an interview and blood collection for the detection of HBV serological markers and HBV-DNA phylogenetic analysis.
Results
HBV exposure (anti-HBc+) was 9.8% (95% CI: 8.8-10.8); 11.2% were female and 9.6% were male. HBsAg+ was 0.6%. Only 31.4% of the participants had HBV vaccination-like profile (anti-HBs+ alone; 30.4% male vs. 36.8% female; p=0.004). Most individuals were susceptible to HBV (60.2% female vs. 52.2% male, p=0.001). HBV isolates were classified as genotypes A (45.4%), D (27.3%) and F (27.3%). In males, HBV exposure was associated with increased age. Male prisoners had more evidence of HCV/HBV co-infection (10.7%) than females (3.4%) and the frequency of Treponema pallidum infection among prisoners who had been exposed to HBV was higher in female prisoners when compared with male (39.7% vs. 19.1%). The incidence of HBV was 0.18/100 person-years (95% CI: 0.12%–0.25%).
Conclusions
Our results indicate a high prevalence of HBV exposure in prisoners. Despite the low incidence of this infection, the occurrence of new cases indicates the need to implement preventive measures."

Diagnosing pulmonary blastomycosis (PB) requires the detection of Blastomyces dermatitidis in pulmonary secretions or tissue, which can be achieved via bronchoscopic procedures like bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or brush and transbronchial biopsy (TBBx). This descriptive study retrieved the data of PB that was diagnosed by bronchoscopy to define which bronchoscopic procedure produced the highest yield.
Methods
Retrospectively, all patients diagnosed with PB via bronchoscopic approach were identified. Non-invasive BAL was referred to when performed first in the order of bronchoscopic procedures, and invasive BAL was used when it was performed after other bronchoscopic procedures.
Results
A total of 111 patients were included in the study. BAL produced the highest yield of all bronchoscopic procedures (>87%), regardless if it was performed first in order (non-invasive, 87.3%) or not (invasive BAL, 89.6%) (p = 0.43). Performing bronchoscopy and BAL earlier in the course of the disease resulted in a significantly better diagnostic yield.
Conclusions
BAL is probably enough to diagnose PB. Also, it had the best yield when performed earlier, regardless of whether it was performed first in order or not. BAL culture had a better yield in detecting Blastomyces dermatitidis over fungal stain and cytology."

Studies reported associations of inflammatory markers with the severity of COVID-19, but conclusions were inconsistent. We aimed to provide an overview of the association of inflammatory markers with the severity of COVID-19.
Methods
We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Wanfang and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database until March 20, 2020. Weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random or fixed-effects models.
Results
A total of 16 studies comprising 3962 patients with COVID-19 were included in our analysis. Random-effect results demonstrated that patients with COVID-19 in the nonsevere group had lower levels for CRP (WMD = −41.78 mg/l, 95% CI = [−52.43, −31.13], P < 0.001), PCT (WMD = −0.13 ng/ml, 95% CI = [−0.20, −0.05], P < 0.001), IL-6 (WMD = −21.32 ng/l, 95% CI = [−28.34, −14.31], P < 0.001), ESR (WMD = −8 mm/h, 95% CI = [−14, −2], P = 0.005), SAA (WMD = −43.35 μg/ml, 95% CI = [−80.85, −5.85], P = 0.020) and serum ferritin (WMD = −398.80 mg/l, 95% CI = [−625.89, −171.71], P < 0.001), compared with those in the severe group. Moreover, survivors had a lower level of IL-6 than non-survivors (WMD = −4.80 ng/ml, 95% CI = [−5.87, −3.73], P < 0.001). These results were consistent through sensitivity analysis and publication bias assessment.

Numerous studies investigate the advantages of rapid molecular drug susceptibility testing (DST) in comparison to phenotypic DST, but the clinical impact on treating multi/extensively drug resistant TB(M/XDR-TB) is less studied. Therefore, we examined how molecular DST testing may improve MDR-TB treatment management and outcome in Chinese settings.
Methods
We performed a comparative study of patient cohorts before and after the implementation of molecular DST diagnosis with Genotype MTBDRsl/MTBDRplus assay in two Chinese hospitals. We collected clinical information including time to sputum culture conversion and final treatment outcome.
Results
In total, 242 MDR-TB patients were studied including 114 before (pre-implementation group) and 128 after the implementation (post-implementation group) of molecular DST. Time to MDR-TB diagnosis was significantly reduced for patients in the post-implementation group, as compared to the pre-implementation group (median,16 vs 62 days; P < 0.001). Patients with early available molecular DST results had a more rapid culture conversion (aHR1.94 95% CI: 1.37-2.73; median,12 vs 24 months, respectively; P < 0.001) and higher rate of treatment success (68% vs 47%, P < 0.01).

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection is reported regularly among adolescents and adults in Caribbean island populations. The disease more often runs a severe course among these populations, causing a substantial burden. The aim of this sero-epidemiological study was to obtain an insight into VZV susceptibility and its determinants in island populations of the Caribbean Netherlands (CN).
Methods
Participants from Bonaire, St. Eustatius, and Saba (n = 1829, aged 0–90 years) donated a blood sample and completed a questionnaire. VZV-specific IgG antibodies were determined using a bead-based multiplex immunoassay. Risk factors were analysed using a logistic regression model.
Results
Overall seroprevalence in CN was 78%, being lowest on St. Eustatius (73%) and highest on Bonaire and Saba (79%). Seropositivity increased gradually with age, with 60% and 80% at ages 10 years and 30 years, respectively, and ranging between 80% and 90% thereafter. Higher odds for VZV seronegativity were seen among persons who were born in CN or had resided there since early childhood, and among single-person households.
Conclusions
VZV susceptibility is relatively high among adolescents and adults in CN. In order to reduce the burden of VZV-related disease in these populations, routine varicella vaccination is recommended. As data are scarce, the study findings can serve as a blueprint for the epidemiology in tropical regions."

Methods
Population-based study, with CRP and PA measurements on day 1 (D1) and D4. Relative CRP variations in relation to D1 CRP value were evaluated (CRP-ratio). Patients were classified as fast response, slow response, non-response, and biphasic response.
Results
A total of 935 patients were included. At D4, the CRP-ratio was lower in survivors on D365 in comparison with D4–D30 non-survivors and D30–D365 non-survivors (p<0.001). In comparison with fast response patients, non-response and biphasic response patients had 2.74 and 5.29 increased risk, respectively, of death in D4–D30 and 2.77 and 3.16 increased risk, respectively, of death in D31–D365. PA levels remained roughly unchanged from D1–D4, but lower D1 PA predicted higher short and long-term mortality (p<0.001). The discriminative performance of the CRP-ratio and D1 PA to identify patients with poor short and long-term mortality after adjustments was acceptable (AUROC=0.79).
Conclusions
Serial CRP measurements at D1 and D4 after CA-BSI is clinically useful to identify patients with poor outcome. Individual patterns of CRP-ratio response with PA at D1 further refine our ability of predicting short or long-term mortality."

Currently there is no guideline based on preoperative clinical parameters for assessing the prognosis of the adjunctive surgery for drug-resistant tuberculosis.
Methods
We retrospectively analyzed 138 patients who had undergone surgical resection as a treatment for drug- resistant tuberculosis after 24 months. Four clinical parameters on lesion type, treatment history, body physiological status, and surgery approach were evaluated. Categorical preoperative clinical parameters were analyzed by ordinal logistic regression model when considering postoperative complications as outcomes ordered in terms of severity. Statistically significant parameters were then combined in a single classification system for predicting the outcomes of the adjunctive surgery.
Findings
Diffused, progressive bilateral lesions, or active/progressive extra pulmonary tuberculosis (L3), and history of less than 2 months treatment before surgery (T3) were the strongest predicative parameters for postoperative complications and for surgery failure. Classification systems based on the four parameters were found to have a statistically significant effect on postoperative complications and postoperative efficacy. 24- month follow up indicated a high cure rate (above 95.5%) among patients without T3, L3, or severe physiological complications (B3).
Interpretation
A classification system based on objective clinical parameters showed predicative value for the prognosis of the adjunctive surgery and could guide management of drug-resistant Tuberculosis."

To evaluate image quality and detection rate of four 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences and MRI performances in pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) when compared to computed tomography (CT).
Methods
Forty patients with pulmonary tuberculosis separately underwent CT and 3T-MRI with T1-weighted free-breathing star-volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination (Star-VIBE) and standard VIBE, T2-weighted two-dimensional fast BLADE turbo spin-echo (2D-fBLADE TSE) and three-dimensional isotropic turbo spin-echo (3D-SPACE). Four MRI sequences were compared in terms of detection rate and image quality, which consisted of signal to noise ratio (SNR), contrast to noise ratio (CNR) and 5-point scoring scale. The total sensitivity was also compared between CT and MRI. Inter-observer agreement on 5-point scoring scale was calculated by Cohen’s kappa (k). SNR, CNR and 5-point scoring scale were compared using two-tailed pared t-test. Using CT as a reference, the MRI detection rate of pulmonary abnormality was evaluated by Pearson’s Chi-square test. Furthermore, the sizes of the nodules (≥5 mm) were compared using intraclass correlation coefficient.
Results
In this study, Free-breathing Star-VIBE had significantly better SNR and identical CNR compared with standard VIBE. 2D-fBLADE TSE had statistically higher SNR but uniform or inferior CNR compared with 3D-SPACE. Inter-observers showed excellent agreement on 5-point scoring scale. The average score of Star-VIBE and VIBE had no difference. The average score of 2D-fBLADE TSE was higher than 3D-SPACE. There were no statistical differences in the detection rates of non-calcified parenchymal lesions between Star-VIBE and standard VIBE, 2D-fBALDE TSE and 3D-SPACE. MRI is comparable to CT in detecting consolidation, cavity, non-calcified nodules of ≥5 mm and tree-in-bud signs compared to CT. MRI detected non-calcified nodules of ＜5 mm, 5–10 mm, ≥10 mm and calcified nodules with sensitivity of 69.6%, 90.6%, 100% and 89.5% respectively. In addition, the sizes of the nodules (≥5 mm) had statistical consistency. MRI is more sensitive in detecting caseous necrosis, liquefaction, active cavity, abnormalities of lymph nodes and pleura.
Conclusions
T1-weighted free-breathing Star-VIBE and T2-weighted 2D-fBLADE TSE, both with satisfactory image quality, are suitable for patients with pulmonary TB who need long-term follow-ups in clinical routine, especially for children, young women and pregnant women."

To analyze the effects of one dose of live attenuated hepatitis A vaccine in a developing country.
Methods
The reported cases of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection from 2005 to 2018 in Henan province, China, were analyzed. Data of vaccinated children were assessed on the childhood immunization information management system. Questionnaire survey and blood sample collection were randomly conducted in six counties and districts of Henan province to analyze the prevalence of HAV lgG among the population aged 0–70 years.
Results
In 2008, Henan province began to expand its program on immunization, and children aged 18 months were given one dose of live attenuated hepatitis A vaccine (HepA-L). From 2005 to 2007, the HAV incidence remained steady at above 5000 cases per year and increased to 7489 in 2007. Since 2008, the HAV incidence decreased cumulatively from 4576 to 237 in 2018, indicating a 94.8% decrease, which was particularly pronounced among adolescents (98.2%). The proportion of hepatitis A cases in patients younger than 10 years continually decreased from 41.6% in 2012 to 3.8% in 2018. The reduction of reported cases older than 40 years was slower than that of children. In 2012, the proportion of hepatitis A cases older than 40 years was 27.6%, and continually increased to 69.2% (164/237) in 2018. The results of serological investigation showed that the 0–1.5-year age group had the lowest anti-HAV IgG prevalence (38.6%), which increased to 75.0% in the 4–6-year age group, covered by this immunization program.

The feasibility of the decontamination procedure for Legionella pneumophila of water systems in healthcare facilities varies by water purification and disinfection methods in each country. We evaluated the efficacy of feasible decontamination strategies in Japan.
Methods
This study was conducted at Tokyo Medical University Hospital (1015 beds) between 2015 and 2018. Samples from the water system and cooling tower were cultured periodically. Hyper-chlorination of cool tap water (>0.2 ppm), increases in the temperature of hot water (>55 °C), and flushing were used as decontamination strategies. The case of healthcare-associated legionellosis was surveyed. Environmental and clinical isolates were genotyped.
Results
1439 environmental samples were collected; 19 (1.3%) samples tested positive for L. pneumophila from water faucets of patient rooms, toilets, waste rooms, and water sourced from wells. Genotyping of 12 isolates confirmed that the same strains were present in eight environmental isolates and two isolates from patients over three years. Although the environmental contamination of the water system was persistent, the number of positive locations of hospital environments gradually decreased; eight in 2015, four in 2016, three in 2017, and four in 2018, respectively.

We assessed the cost-effectiveness of Camino Verde, a community-based mobilization strategy to prevent and control dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases. A cluster-randomized controlled trial in Managua, Nicaragua, and in three coastal regions in Guerrero, Mexico (75 intervention and 75 control clusters), Camino Verde used non-governmental community health workers, called brigadistas, to support community mobilization. This donor-funded trial demonstrated reductions of 29.5% (95% confidence interval, CI: 3.8%–55.3%) on dengue infections and 24.7% (CI: 1.8%–51.2%) on self-reported cases.
Methods
We estimated program costs through a micro-costing approach and semi-structured questionnaires. We show results as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for costs per disability-adjusted life-year (DALYs) averted and conducted probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
Findings
The Camino Verde trial spent US$16.72 in Mexico and $7.47 in Nicaragua per person annually. We found an average of 910 (CI: 487–1 353) and 500 (CI: 250–760) dengue cases averted annually per million population in Mexico and Nicaragua, respectively, compared to control communities. The ICER in Mexico was US$29 618 (CI: 13 869–66 898) per DALY averted, or 3.0 times per capita GDP. For Nicaragua, the ICER was US$29 196 (CI: 14294–72181) per DALY averted, or 16.9 times per capita GDP.
Interpretation
Camino Verde, as implemented in the research context, was marginally cost-effective in Mexico, and not cost-effective in Nicaragua, from a healthcare sector perspective. Nicaragua’s low per capita GDP and the use of grant-funded management personnel weakened the cost-effectiveness results. Achieving efficiencies by incorporating Camino Verde activities into existing public health programs would make Camino Verde cost-effective."

abstract = "China is one of the countries with a high burden of tuberculosis (TB) and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). It was recently estimated that China had the highest LTBI burden in the world, with approximately 350 million persons living with the infection. The prevalence of LTBI in China is overestimated by tuberculin skin test (TST) as compared to interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). A population-based study found that IGRA positivity rates ranged between 13.5% and 19.8%. The annual TB infection rate in the rural population was 1.5% based on persistent positive IGRA results in converters. The development of active TB from LTBI in the general rural population was 0.87 per 100 person-years in the first 2 years among individuals who newly converted to IGRA-positive. TB control in students has been paid more attention by the government, which also improved LTBI management among students in close contact with active TB patients. A 3-month regimen of twice-weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid (3H2P2, both with a maximum dose of 600 mg) has been practiced for LTBI treatment in China for years. With respect to LTBI management in populations using immune inhibitors, an expert consensus on TB prevention and management in tumor necrosis factor antagonist application was published in 2013 in China. In order to achieve the global goals of the End TB Strategy, China needs innovative ideas and technologies to reduce the TB incidence by management of LTBI, such as the identification of populations for LTBI testing and treatment, selecting and developing reliable LTBI tests, exploring safe and effective preventive treatment tools, and establishing a set of optimized LTBI management systems."

Hoping to improve health-related effectiveness, a two-phase vaccination against rabies was designed and executed in northern Tanzania in 2018, which included geo-epidemiological and economic perspectives.
Methods
Considering the local bio-geography and attempting to rapidly establish a protective ring around a city at risk, the first phase intervened on sites surrounding that city, where the population density was lower than in the city at risk. The second phase vaccinated a rural area.
Results
No rabies-related case has been reported in the vaccinated areas for over a year post-immunisation; hence, the campaign is viewed as highly cost-effective. Other metrics included: rapid implementation (concluded in half the time spent on other campaigns) and the estimated cost per protected life, which was 3.28 times lower than in similar vaccinations.
Conclusions
The adopted design emphasised local bio-geographical dynamics: it prevented the occurrence of an epidemic in a city with a higher demographic density than its surrounding area and it also achieved greater effectiveness than average interventions. These interdisciplinary, policy-oriented experiences have broad and immediate applications in settings of limited and/or time-sensitive (expertise, personnel, and time available to intervene) resources and conditions."

This study evaluated the incidence, risk factors, and clinical characteristics of complications of candidaemia in adults, with a focus on endophthalmitis, endocarditis, and osteoarticular infections.
Methods
All patients ≥18 years old with candidaemia in two Korean tertiary hospitals from 2007 to 2016 were investigated. Complications of candidaemia were defined as the presence of endophthalmitis, endocarditis, or osteoarticular infections documented in patients with candidaemia. The clinical characteristics and risk factors for candidaemia with complications were analysed in the patients who underwent ophthalmological examinations.
Results
Of 765 adult patients with candidaemia, 34 (4.4%) met the definition of complications, including endophthalmitis in 29 (3.8%), endocarditis in 4 (0.5%), and osteoarticular infections in 3 (0.4%). Of the 225 patients who underwent ophthalmological examinations, 29 (12.9%) had endophthalmitis. Candida albicans was an independent risk factor for complicated candidaemia (OR, 5.12; 95% CI, 2.17–12.09; P < 0.001). Although the mortality rate was no higher in complicated candidaemia, the duration of antifungal therapy was longer (23.1 ± 17.6 vs. 16.4 ± 10.8 days, P = 0.042), and 13 patients (39.3%) underwent additional procedures or surgery.
Conclusions
Complications of candidaemia occurred in 4.4% of adult patients. C. albicans was an independent risk factor for complicated candidaemia in adults. Complications of candidaemia might need prolonged treatment and additional procedures or surgery. Therefore, careful evaluation and active treatment of candidaemia with complications should be encouraged."

The incidence of NTM infections is rising owing to a growing population of immunocompromised and vulnerable individuals, complex medical and surgical procedures, as well as increased awareness and diagnostic capabilities. The prevalence of different NTM varies between continents, regions, and countries. The true global burden of pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease is unknown and estimates are subject to under and/or over-estimation. Diagnosis requires confirmation by isolation of NTM along with clinical and radiological criteria, which may be suboptimal at all levels. Susceptibility testing is complex and clinical breakpoints are not available for many of the drugs. Frequently, NTM infections are not considered until late in the course of disease. Improved and rapid detection of tuberculosis cases in high-burden countries has, however, also brought NTM infections into the limelight, and has identified a need for research efforts towards rapid diagnostic tests and the identification of biomarkers to monitor the treatment response in patients with NTM infections."

Phenotypic (Sensititre Myco, pDST) and genotypic drug susceptibility testing (GenoType NTM DR, gDST) in M. avium complex (MAC) have become available as standardized assays, but comparable data is needed. This study aimed to investigate the phenotypic and genotypic drug susceptibility patterns in MAC clinical isolates.
Methods
Overall, 98 isolates from 85 patients were included. pDST and gDST were performed on all isolates and results compared regarding specificity and sensitivity using pDST as a reference method. The impact of drug instability on pDST results was studied using a biological assay over 14 days. In addition, the evolution of antimicrobial resistance was investigated in sequential isolates of 13 patients.
Results
Macrolide resistance was rare, 1.2% (95% CI 0.7–7.3) of isolates in the base cohort. No aminoglycoside resistances were found, but 14.1% of the studied isolates (95% CI 7.8–23.8) showed intermediate susceptibility. The GenoType NTM DR identified two out of four macrolide-resistant isolates. Antibiotic stability was demonstrated to be poor in rifampicin, rifabutin, and doxycycylin.
Conclusions
pDST results in NTM for unstable antibiotics must be interpreted with care. A combination of pDST and gDST will be useful for the guidance of antimicrobial therapy in MAC-disease."

Data analysis was conducted using WHO Excel tool and SPSS V20.
Results
EWI-IV was excellent across all of the six rounds of EWI surveys conducted between 2008 and 2015. There were improvements in EWI-II over time from 55.6% to 81%. However, EWI-I and EWI-III declined from 86.7% to 31% and 100% to 41%, respectively. During 2015, half of the HFs in Gambella, Amhara and Southern Nation, Nationalities and people regional (SNNPR) states achieved excellent performance for EWI-I. Similarly, all HFs in Afar, Amhara, Dire Dawa, Harari and Tigray regions achieved excellent performance for EWI-II. There were also differences by level of HFs for EWI-III; 62% of hospitals and 28% of health centers were out of stock of one or more ARV drugs by 2015.
Conclusion
Excellent performance of EWI-IV and improvement of EWI-II over time shall be maintained. The program shall further work to ensure medication adherence and supply continuity."

This study aimed to determine the characteristics and risk factors of adult new-onset seizure patients with tuberculous meningitis (TBM) during long-term follow-up.
Methods
Patients with TBM who were seen between June 2012 and January 2018 were retrospectively reviewed and categorized into two groups based on the presence or absence of new-onset seizures. Seizure characteristics, functional outcomes and risk factors were assessed.
Results
A total of 223 patients with TBM were enrolled, including 20.6% (46/223) with seizures. In all, 39.1% (18/46) of the patients with new-onset seizures and 14.1% (25/177) of the patients without seizures died (p < 0.001). Seizures were classified as single (n = 14/46, 30.4%), repetitive (n = 25/46, 54.3%), or status epilepticus (n = 7/46, 15.2%). We found that non-single seizures (repetitive seizures and status epilepticus) were associated with mortality (P = 0.002, P = 0.022), while single seizures were not (P = 0.834). The independent risk factors associated with non-single seizures were cortical involvement (p = 0.007) and epileptiform discharges (p = 0.001).
Conclusions
Non-single seizures were associated with poor functional outcomes and should be noted by the clinic. Cortical involvement and epileptiform discharges are independent risk factors for non-single seizures."

Since the first case of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) identified on Jan 20, 2020, in South Korea, the number of cases rapidly increased, resulting in 6284 cases including 42 deaths as of Mar 6, 2020. To examine the growth rate of the outbreak, we present the first study to report the reproduction number of COVID-19 in South Korea.
Methods
The daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea were extracted from publicly available sources. By using the empirical reporting delay distribution and simulating the generalized growth model, we estimated the effective reproduction number based on the discretized probability distribution of the generation interval.
Results
We identified four major clusters and estimated the reproduction number at 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4–1.6). In addition, the intrinsic growth rate was estimated at 0.6 (95% CI: 0.6, 0.7), and the scaling of growth parameter was estimated at 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7, 0.8), indicating sub-exponential growth dynamics of COVID-19. The crude case fatality rate is higher among males (1.1%) compared to females (0.4%) and increases with older age.
Conclusions
Our results indicate an early sustained transmission of COVID-19 in South Korea and support the implementation of social distancing measures to rapidly control the outbreak."

We describe epidemiological trends of human brucellosis in Germany over a 13 year period based on national surveillance data.
Methods
We analyzed demographic, clinical, laboratory and exposure information of symptomatic laboratory-confirmed brucellosis cases notified 2006–18. Using official population data, we calculated incidences and risk ratios (RR).
Results
From 2006 to 2018, 408 brucellosis cases were notified in Germany (mean annual incidence: 0.38/1,000,000 population), of which 75% were travel-associated. Yearly notifications peaked in 2014 (n = 47) and remained elevated compared to 2006–2013 (mean: n = 25). Asylum seekers (AS) arriving in Germany accounted for 9/44 (2015) and 15/36 (2016) cases, respectively. RR AS/non-AS 2015–2016: 28, 95% CI: 17–45. Unpasteurized milk products were most frequently notified as source of infection. Imported food and occupational exposure played a role in autochthonous cases.
Conclusions
The incidence of human brucellosis has markedly increased in recent years. Most of the observed rise in notifications can be explained by infections in AS. Exposure still predominantly occurs abroad. Risk factors for autochthonous infections need to be investigated further, though imported dairy products seem to play a role. Physicians should consider brucellosis as differential diagnosis in AS and people with travel to endemic regions with compatible symptoms."

We propose conceptual models for the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan with the consideration of individual behavioural reaction and governmental actions, e.g., holiday extension, travel restriction, hospitalisation and quarantine. We employe the estimates of these two key components from the 1918 influenza pandemic in London, United Kingdom, incorporated zoonotic introductions and the emigration, and then compute future trends and the reporting ratio. The model is concise in structure, and it successfully captures the course of the COVID-19 outbreak, and thus sheds light on understanding the trends of the outbreak."

A familial cluster of five patients associated with COVID-19 was enrolled in the hospital. We collected epidemiological and clinical characteristics, laboratory outcomes from electronic medical records, and also verified them with the patients and their families.
Results
Among them, three family members (Case 3/4/5) had returned from Wuhan. Additionally, two family members, those who had not traveled to Wuhan, also contracted COVID-19 after contacting with the other three family members. Case 1 developed severe pneumonia and was admitted to the ICU. Case 3 and Case 5 presented fever and cough on days two through three of hospitalization and had ground-glass opacity changes in their lungs. Case 4 presented with diarrhea and pharyngalgia after admission without radiographic abnormalities. Case 2 presented no clinical nor radiographic abnormalities.

This study retrospectively included 43 patients with a laboratory-confirmed infection and 33 patients with a suspected infection, in whom the disease was eventually excluded. The IgM/IgG titer of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay analysis.
Results
Compared to molecular detection, the sensitivities of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to diagnose COVID-19 were 48.1% and 88.9%, and the specificities were 100% and 90.9%, respectively.In the COVID-19 group, the IgM-positive rate increased slightly at first and then decreased over time; in contrast, the IgG-positive rate increased to 100% and was higher than IgM at all times. The IgM-positive rate and titer were not significantly different before and after conversion to virus-negative. The IgG-positive rate was up to 90% and not significantly different before and after conversion to virus-negative. However, the median IgG titer after conversion to virus-negative was double that before, and the difference was significant.

An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia hit a major city in China, Wuhan, December 2019 and subsequently reached other provinces/regions of China and other countries. We present estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak.
Methods
Accounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases time series, in mainland China from January 10 to January 24, 2020, through the exponential growth. With the estimated intrinsic growth rate (γ), we estimated R0 by using the serial intervals (SI) of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations for the true unknown SI.
Findings
The early outbreak data largely follows the exponential growth. We estimated that the mean R0 ranges from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96–2.55) to 3.58 (95%CI: 2.89–4.39) associated with 8-fold to 2-fold increase in the reporting rate. We demonstrated that changes in reporting rate substantially affect estimates of R0.
Conclusion
The mean estimate of R0 for the 2019-nCoV ranges from 2.24 to 3.58, and is significantly larger than 1. Our findings indicate the potential of 2019-nCoV to cause outbreaks."

This study aims to summarize the clinical characteristics of death cases with COVID-19 and to identify critically ill patients of COVID-19 early and reduce their mortality.
Methods
The clinical records, laboratory findings and radiological assessments included chest X-ray or computed tomography were extracted from electronic medical records of 25 died patients with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 14 to Feb 13, 2020. Two experienced clinicians reviewed and abstracted the data.
Results
The age and underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, etc.) were the most important risk factors for death of COVID-19 pneumonia. Bacterial infections may play an important role in promoting the death of patients. Malnutrition was common to severe patients. Multiple organ dysfunction can be observed, the most common organ damage was lung, followed by heart, kidney and liver. The rising of neutrophils, SAA, PCT, CRP, cTnI, D-dimer, LDH and lactate levels can be used as indicators of disease progression, as well as the decline of lymphocytes counts.
Conclusions
The clinical characteristics of 25 death cases with COVID-19 we summarized, which would be helpful to identify critically ill patients of COVID-19 early and reduce their mortality."

To estimate the serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from information on 28 infector-infectee pairs.
Methods
We collected dates of illness onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases (infectees) from published research articles and case investigation reports. We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full dataset (n = 28) and a subset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n = 18). In addition, we adjust for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase.
Results
Accounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9). Limiting our data to only the most certain pairs, the median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95% CrI: 3.5, 5.9).
Conclusions
The serial interval of COVID-19 is close to or shorter than its median incubation period. This suggests that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset. The COVID-19 serial interval is also shorter than the serial interval of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), indicating that calculations made using the SARS serial interval may introduce bias."

abstract = "Introduction
The global Guinea Worm Eradication Program has reduced numbers of human infections of Guinea worm disease (dracunculiasis) to 49 cases in four countries. However, infections of domestic animals (dogs and cats) have recently been recognized and are increasing. Typically, Guinea worm (Dracunculus medinensis) transmission occurs via the ingestion of copepods from water. Despite several interventions, including tethering of dogs while worms emerge, the number of infected dogs continue to increase. One hypothesis is that dogs could be infected through the ingestion of copepods in provisioned water.
Objectives
The purpose of this study was to determine whether copepods can survive in water containers under typical Chadian temperatures.
Methods
Four container types (plastic, glass, gourd, and metal) were seeded with copepods and exposed to simulated Chadian temperatures.
Results
All copepods in the metal containers died within 4 h. Conversely, after 8 h live copepods were still present in plastic, glass, and gourd containers.
Conclusions
If provisioned water is provided to potential hosts of D. medinensis, metal containers create the most inhospitable environment for copepods. Plastic containers have little effect on copepod mortality. The use of metal containers for water provisions could be a useful tool assisting with the interruption of D. medinensis transmission among dogs."

The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a zoonotic beta-coronavirus entitled 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), has become a global threat. Awareness of the biological features of 2019-nCoV should be updated in time and needs to be comprehensively summarized to help optimize control measures and make therapeutic decisions.
Methods
Based on recently published literature, official documents and selected up-to-date preprint studies, we reviewed the virology and origin, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathology and treatment of 2019-nCoV infection, in comparison with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.
Results
The genome of 2019-nCoV partially resembled SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and indicated a bat origin. The COVID-19 generally had a high reproductive number, a long incubation period, a short serial interval and a low case fatality rate (much higher in patients with comorbidities) than SARS and MERS. Clinical presentation and pathology of COVID-19 greatly resembled SARS and MERS, with less upper respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, and more exudative lesions in post-mortems. Potential treatments included remdesivir, chloroquine, tocilizumab, convalescent plasma and vaccine immunization (when possible).
Conclusion
The initial experience from the current pandemic and lessons from the previous two pandemics can help improve future preparedness plans and combat disease progression."

Biomarkers are widely used for rapid diagnosis of sepsis. This study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of presepsin, procalcitonin (PCT), and C-reactive protein (CRP) in differentiating sepsis severity as well as their association with Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score.
Methods
One hundred septic patients from two university clinical centers were enrolled in the study during two time periods. New Sepsis-3 definitions were used for sepsis stratification. Biomarkers and SOFA score were evaluated four times during the illness. A sandwich ELISA kit was used for presepsin measurement. Generalized linear mixed effects model was used to test the changes in biomarkers concentrations and SOFA score values during the illness and to estimate the differences between severity groups. Multivariate analysis was used to test the association of biomarkers with SOFA score.
Results
Presepsin concentrations were significantly higher on admission in patients with septic shock (n = 34) compared to patients with sepsis (n = 66), mean ± SD: 128.5 ± 47.6 ng/mL vs. 88.6 ± 65.6 ng/mL, respectively (p < 0.001). The same was not observed for PCT and CRP; their concentrations did not differ significantly between severity groups. A strong correlation of presepsin with SOFA score was also found (p < 0.0001).

Significant alterations in the pharmacokinetic characteristics of linezolid are often seen in sepsis patients. The study aimed to identify a target pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) index of the efficacy of linezolid treatment, and to estimate the optimum dosage regimen of linezolid in sepsis patients.
Methods
The PK data were modeled using the one-compartment model, which determined the target PK/PD index for successful treatment by logistic regression. The probability of thrombocytopenia was identified by establishing a logistic model. Different dosing regimens were evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation.
Results
Reaching 80% bacterial eradication required an AUC24/MIC of 100, which defined the therapeutic target. The proposed regimen to attain a cumulative fraction of response ≥80% was 800 mg/12 h (safety probability 66.8%) for sepsis patients with normal renal function or mild kidney damage. By contrast, the target cumulative fraction of response was attained with a standard dosing regimen in sepsis patients on continuous renal replacement therapy [600 mg/12 h (safety probability 49.7%)].
Conclusions
This study identified different dosing strategies to achieve target linezolid PK/PD values according to whether sepsis patients were treated with continuous renal replacement therapy. Due to the high incidence of thrombocytopenia in sepsis patients on continuous renal replacement therapy, therapeutic drug monitoring should be encouraged for optimizing linezolid exposure in sepsis patients."

To identify the impact of a mass gathering event (MGE) on emergency department (ED) patient presentations with communicable diseases and underpinning syndromic indicators (SIs).
Methods
This retrospective observational cohort study was undertaken in one large public teaching hospital ED in Queensland, Australia. Routinely collected ED data for patient presentations with an ICD-10 diagnosis corresponding to a communicable disease were used to compare demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes before (March 23 to April 3), during (April 4 to April 15), and after (April 16 to April 27) the 2018 Commonwealth Games.
Results
Over the study period, there were 10 595 patient presentations to the ED; 14.2% (n = 1503) were diagnosed with a communicable disease. The median age of those with a communicable disease was 8 years, 50.5% (n = 759) were female, and 24.8% (n = 373) arrived by ambulance. The most common communicable disease profile was respiratory in nature (51.4%, n = 772). The most common SI was altered breathing (24.0%, n = 185). ED length of stay (LOS) increased over the study period (pre: 160 min; during: 163 min; post: 180 min, p < 0.001).
Conclusions
The 2018 Commonwealth Games had an impact on ED presentations with communicable diseases, in terms of LOS. A longer LOS and higher percentage of patients with a LOS of more than 4 hrs in the ED were noted following the MGE period. This outcome indicates a potential need to continue with up-scaled services. Future research is required to understand the broader impact on other EDs in the area, and longitudinal patient follow-up is needed to determine the potential spread of communicable diseases."

The Philippines has the fastest growing HIV epidemic in the Asia-Pacific. This increase was accompanied by a shift in the predominant HIV subtype from B to CRF01_AE. Increasing evidence points to a difference in treatment responses between subtypes. We examined treatment failure and acquired drug resistance (ADR) in people living with HIV (PLHIVs) after one year on antiretrovirals (ARVs).
Methods
PLHIV maintained on ARVs for one year were recruited. Treatment failure was defined as a viral load of ≥1000 copies/mL. Sanger sequencing for genotyping and drug resistance mutation (DRM) detection was performed on patients failing treatment.
Results
513 PLHIV were enrolled. The most common antiretroviral regimens were TDF+3TC + EFV (269) and AZT+3TC + EFV (155). 53 (10.3%) subjects failed treatment. Among these, 48 (90.6%) had DRMs, 84.9% were subtype CRF01_AE. Tenofovir-based regimens performed worse than zidovudine-based regimens (OR 3.28, 95% CI 1.58–7.52 p < 0.001). Higher rates of NRTI, NNRTI, K65R tenofovir resistance, and multi-class resistance were found compared to those reported in literature.

Very few infectious disease physicians exist in Japan. A concerted infection control intervention program involving an antimicrobial stewardship team and multiple components was designed and implemented in multiple hospitals from 2010. Here, we aimed to retrospectively evaluate the intervention program’s effectiveness.
Methods
The frequencies of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa were monitored in four acute-care hospitals. The primary goal of the program was to accelerate the speed of decline of such resistance. A quasi-experimental study design was used to detect accelerated rates of increases in drug susceptibility, comparing time before and after the intervention.
Results
Both MRSA and drug-resistant P. aeruginosa exhibited decreasing trends (p < 0.01 for all four hospitals and all bacterial cultures). Compared with the whole of Japan, the decreasing trends for MRSA and drug-resistant P. aeruginosa in the four hospitals accelerated after the intervention program was established; notably, the rate of MRSA decrease increased by 50%–150% of its original value.
Conclusions
The intervention program successfully reduced the proportion of drug resistance in the four hospitals. Centering on systematic education, decision-making support, and implementation and oversight by an infectious disease consultant, this program was shown to be effective where specialist physicians are scarce."

Severe hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is associated with high mortality in children, and persistent sympathetic activation is a common presentation. The aim of this study was to prospectively investigate serum chromogranin A (CHGA) levels and their prognostic role in this condition.
Methods
Serum CHGA, creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB), serum D-dimer, norepinephrine, blood glucose, lactate, and C-reactive protein levels, white blood cell (WBC) counts, usage of vasopressors, pediatric risk of mortality Ⅲ (PRISM-Ⅲ) scores, and viral etiology were measured upon pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission. The correlation between clinical outcomes and the indicators listed above were analyzed, and the ability of CHGA as a biomarker to predict mortality was evaluated.
Results
Serum CHGA levels were higher in the non-survivors group than in the survivors group (median (interquartile range): 434.8 (374.3–502.4) vs 183.3 (131.9–246.9) μg/l; p < 0.001) and were correlated with norepinephrine (r = 0.37. p < 0.001), blood glucose (r = 0.32, p = 0.001), lactate (r = 0.25, p = 0.009), WBC (r = 0.20, p = 0.039), and PRISM-Ⅲ scores (r = 0.748, p < 0.0001). Patients suffering neurogenic pulmonary edema, those infected with enterovirus A71, and those requiring more vasopressors had higher serum CHGA levels (median (interquartile range): 385 (239.9–488.8) vs 161 (115.6–222.9), 340.6 (190.6–436.0) vs 150.5 (112.1–210.0), 395.6 (209.1–487.0) vs 167.7 (110.5–240.5) μg/l, respectively; p < 0.0001). The CHGA level upon PICU admission in severe HFMD could be an independent risk factor for mortality (adjusted odds ratio 2.459, 95% confidence interval 1.054–5.906, p = 0.038) with high specificity (87.5%) and sensitivity (82.6%) (cut-off value at 339.6 μg/l).

Methods
The clinical data of 92 patients diagnosed with Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis) infections were collected. Of these patients, 28 received regular treatment with azithromycin and 64 received minocycline. All patients underwent three monthly follow-ups after the completion of treatment. The microdilution method was used for the in vitro susceptibility tests. The acquisition of 23S rRNA mutations and presence of the tet(M) gene were detected by gene amplification and sequencing.
Results
The MICs of azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, doxycycline, and minocycline were comparable for isolates from the treatment failure and treatment success groups. Higher detection rates of 23S rRNA gene mutations and tet(M) were found in the treatment failure group (57.14% and 71.43%, respectively) than in the treatment success group (14.29% and 30.23%, respectively) (p < 0.05). The A2057G, C2452A, and T2611C gene mutations of 23S rRNA were detected in eight clinical isolates from the azithromycin treatment failure group, while the T2611C gene mutation was detected in one clinical strain from the treatment success group.

abstract = "Objective
To assess the incidence and determinants of tuberculosis (TB) among HIV-positive individuals in selected health facilities of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, during the period January 2013 to December 2018.
Methods
Data were collected from the records of 566 HIV-positive individuals. A retrospective cohort study design was employed. Data were entered into Epi Info 7 and analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 20. TB incidence density was determined per 100 person-years. Time-to-event distributions were estimated using Kaplan–Meier estimates. Survival curves and hazards across different categories were compared using log-rank tests. Determinants were identified using the Cox proportional hazards model. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed. A p-value <0.05 in the multivariate analysis was considered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 566 HIV-positive individuals were followed for 2140.08 person-years, giving a TB incidence density rate of 6.82/100 person-years (146, 25.8%). The highest incidence was observed within the first year of follow-up. Independent determinants were large family size (adjusted HR (AHR) 1.783, 95% CI 1.113–2.855), lower baseline CD4 (AHR 2.568, 95% CI 1.602–4.116), and baseline body mass index <18.5 kg/m2 (AHR 1.907, 95% CI 1.530–2.690). Being enrolled in antiretroviral treatment (AHR 0.066, 95% CI 0.045–0.98) and taking isoniazid prophylaxis treatment (AHR 0.202, 95% CI 0.108–0.380) had a protective effect.
Conclusions
TB is still a major cause of morbidity among HIV-positive individuals. Early HIV diagnosis, enrollment on antiretroviral treatment, and isoniazid prophylaxis treatment should be considered to decrease the TB risk."

The aims of our study were to (1) evaluate the concordance of both methods for detecting prosthetic joint infection (PJI) pathogens in joint fluid and to (2) clarify whether broad-range polymerase chain reaction (BR-PCR) can be used as a verification method for metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) for PJI diagnosis.
Methods
In total, 63 patients underwent total joint arthroplasty, with 45 PJI and 18 aseptic failure patients included. Joint fluids were sampled after antibiotics were withheld for more than 2 weeks, and then, culture, BR-PCR and mNGS were performed for all samples.
Results
The joint fluid BR-PCR sensitivity was 82.2%, which was not significantly different from that of mNGS (95.6%) or culture (77.8%). The specificities of the 3 methods were all 94.4%. BR-PCR failed to identify the pathogens in 1 polymicrobial infection patient and 4 fungal infection patients.
Conclusion
mNGS was more sensitive than BR-PCR for detecting PJI pathogens in joint fluid. BR-PCR is insufficient for use as an mNGS verification method."

An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China; the epidemic is more widespread than initially estimated, with cases now confirmed in multiple countries.
Aims
The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the prevalence of comorbidities in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients and the risk of underlying diseases in severe patients compared to non-severe patients.
Methods
A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science through February 25, 2020. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects models.
Results
Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis, including 1 576 infected patients. The results showed the most prevalent clinical symptom was fever (91.3%, 95% CI: 86–97%), followed by cough (67.7%, 95% CI: 59–76%), fatigue (51.0%, 95% CI: 34–68%) and dyspnea (30.4%, 95% CI: 21–40%).

When compared between severe and non-severe patients, the pooled OR of hypertension, respiratory system disease, and cardiovascular disease were 2.36 (95% CI: 1.46–3.83), 2.46 (95% CI: 1.76–3.44) and 3.42 (95% CI: 1.88–6.22) respectively.
Conclusion
We assessed the prevalence of comorbidities in the COVID-19 patients and found that underlying disease, including hypertension, respiratory system disease and cardiovascular disease, may be risk factors for severe patients compared with non-severe patients."

abstract = "Objective
This study aimed to explore the impact of atmospheric pollutants on the incidence of tuberculosis (TB), and provide new ideas for the prevention and control of TB in the future.
Methods
It explored the relationship between air pollutants and meteorological factors, as well as between air pollutants and heating through Spearman correlation analysis and rank sum test. Additionally, it analyzed the relationship between air pollutants and TB incidence using the general additive model. Statistical analysis results at the p<0.05 level were considered significant.
Results
Three months after exposure to air pollutants (PM2.5, SO2, NO2, and CO) TB incidence increased. However, TB incidence increased 9 months after exposure to PM10. The single pollutant model showed when concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3 increased by 1μg/m3 (or 1mg/m3), the number of TB cases increased by 0.09%, 0.08%, 0.58%, 0.42%, 6.9%, and 0.57%, respectively. The optimal multi-pollutant model was a two-factor model (PM10+NO2).
Conclusion
Air pollutants including PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3 increased the risk of TB. Few studies have been conducted in this area of research, especially regarding the mechanism. The results of this study should contribute to the understanding of TB incidence and prompt additional research."

We investigated the epidemiological characteristics of drug resistance and virulence factors of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) isolates from paediatric patients in Shanghai.
Methods
CRKP strains were consecutively collected between January and December in 2018. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by VITEK 2 compact. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to analyse drug resistance determinants, virulence genes and plasmid types. wzi sequencing and multilocus sequence typing was used to determine clonal relatedness.
Results
Among 172 CRKP strains, blaKPC-2 and blaNDM-5 were the predominant carbapenemase genes. Compared with NDM-5, KPC-2 producers showed higher resistance rates to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. The majority of KPC-2 producers belonged to KL64-ST11 background, while NDM-5 producers were mainly identified as KL62-ST48. Plasmid typing shown that IncF and IncFIB were the most prevalent plasmids in KPC-2 producers and IncX3 was widely spread in NDM-5-KP. Thirty-seven isolates carried various hypervirulence genes and the profiles of these genes showed high diversity.
Conclusions
The predominant carbapenemase of CRKP strains from paediatric patients in Shanghai were KPC-2 and NDM-5. KL47-ST11 KPC-2-KP and KL62-ST48 NDM-5-KP were representative clonal lineages. Although not prevalent, hypervirulence associated genes have begun to spread. Active long-term surveillance should be performed in both drug resistance characteristics and virulence factors."

The implementation of preventive therapy for persons with the highest risk of developing TB, that is the reduction of the pool of future cases of TB, is now considered one of the activities able to support a decline in the prevalence of TB. This implies that the search for infected contacts and the prevention of TB should be performed in parallel with diagnostic and curative activities. The implementation of screening activities, at least for exposed children and immunocompromised persons, seems to be feasible without unaffordable costs, even in high TB burden settings."

The purpose of this viewpoint is to summarize the advantages and constraints of the tools and strategies available for reducing the annual incidence of tuberculosis (TB) by implementing the World Health Organization (WHO) End TB Strategy and the linked WHO TB Elimination Framework, with special reference to Oman.
Methods
The case-study was built based on the presentations and discussions at an international workshop on TB elimination in low incidence countries organized by the Ministry of Health, Oman, which took place from September 5 to September 7, 2019, and supported by the WHO and European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID).
Results
Existing tools were reviewed, including the screening of migrants for latent TB infection (LTBI) with interferon-gamma release assays, clinical examination for active pulmonary TB (APTB) including chest X-rays, organization of laboratory services, and the existing centres for mandatory health examination of pre-arrival or arriving migrants, including examination for APTB. The need for public–private partnerships to handle the burden of screening arriving migrants for active TB was discussed at length and different models for financing were reviewed.
Conclusions
In a country with a high proportion of migrants from high endemic countries, screening for LTBI is of high priority. Molecular typing and the development of public–private partnerships are needed."

abstract = "Background
The prognostic impact of residual vegetation (RV) after medical treatment for endocarditis remains unknown.
Methods
134 consecutive patients hospitalized for infective endocarditis, not surgically treated, with the presence of vegetation at diagnosis, were included retrospectively. The follow-up started at the end of antibiotic treatment when healing was complete. The presence or absence of RV was assessed at this time. The primary endpoint was a composite of the occurrence of embolic events, recurrence of endocarditis, or death from any cause.
Results
Eighty-five patients were men (63%), mean age was 69 ± 15 years, and median follow-up was 16.3 (IQR: 5–30) months. Sixty-six patients (49%) had RV, 15 (11%) had RV > 10 mm and nine (7%) had RV with an increase in size relative to that of the diagnosis. The primary endpoint occurred in 23 patients (35%) in the group with RV, and in 16 patients (24%) without RV, which was not statistically relevant (HR 1.70; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89–3.22; p = 0.10). Based on univariate Cox regression analysis, the occurrence of the primary endpoint was associated with RV that increased (HR 3.90 95% CI 1.61–9.43; p < 0.01), RV size (HR 1.05; 95% CI 1.01–1.09; p < 0.01) or RV > 10 mm (HR 3.35; 95% CI 1.51–7.39; p < 0.01). Only RV > 10 mm remained significant in multivariate Cox regression: HR3.29; 95% CI 1.20–8.96; p = 0.02.
Conclusions
RV is frequent but has no clear prognostic impact in itself; however, its size, particularly in comparison with the start-of-treatment data, merits particular attention as being potentially associated with increased risk."

Geographic region can be an important source of variation in the immune response to pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV). The aim of this study was to collate data from available PCV clinical trials in order to characterize the differences in antibody responses in different countries.
Methods
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to examine the difference in antibody responses after primary series of PCVs in infants, associated with geographic regions, compared with each other and with the different PCVs using random-effects models.
Results
A total of 69 trials were included. Studies conducted in the Western Pacific Region (WPR) showed higher geometric mean concentrations (GMC) compared to studies conducted in Europe. The pooled GMC for serotype 4 after three doses of PCV7 in the WPR was 5.19 μg/ml (95% confidence interval 4.85–5.53 μg/ml), while for studies conducted in Europe this was 2.01 μg/ml (95% confidence interval 1.88–2.14 μg/ml). The IgG GMC ratios among the WPR versus European regions ranged from 1.51 to 2.87 for PCV7, 1.69 to 3.22 for PCV10, and 1.49 to 3.08 for PCV13.

Results
Most patients (approximately 90%) were classified as common type and with epidemiologic history. Fever and cough were main symptoms. Chest CT showed abnormal attenuation in bilateral multiple lung lobes, distributed in the lower and/or periphery of the lungs (94.98%), with multiple shapes. GGO and vascular enhancement sign were most frequent seen, followed by interlobular septal thickening and air bronchus sign as well as consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping. There were significant differences in most of CT signs between different stage groups. The SpO2 and OI were decreased in stage IV, and the CT score of consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping was significantly lower in stage I (P<0.05). A weak relevance was between the fibrosis score and the value of PaO2 and SpO2 (P<0.05).
Conclusions
Clinical performances of patients with COVID-19, mostly with epidemiologic history and typical symptoms, were critical valuable in the diagnosis of the COVID-19. While chest HRCT provided the distribution, shape, attenuation and extent of lung lesions, as well as some typical CT signs of COVID-19 pneumonia."

The aim of this retrospective case–control study (matched 1:3) performed over a 15-month period on ICU patients with bacteraemia, associated (cases) or not (controls) with GN-ST, was to assess 30-day mortality and clinical/microbiological features of GN-ST.
Results
During the study period, 16 patients with GN-ST and 48 controls were analyzed. Polytrauma was the cause of ICU admission in 12 (75%) cases and 22 (46%) controls (p = 0.019). In no case of septic thrombosis was surgical debridement performed. The site of venous thrombosis was more frequently in the lower limbs, associated with bone fracture in nine out of 12 (75%) cases. The median duration of bacteraemia (22 days vs 1 day; p < 0.001) and time to clinical improvement (15 days vs 4 days; p < 0.001) were significantly longer in cases than in controls. On analysis of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve, bacteraemia >72 h was significantly associated with GN-ST (area under the curve (AUC) 0.95, sensitivity 0.996 and specificity 0.810; p < 0.001). Finally, 30-day mortality was 20% in cases and 67% in controls (p < 0.001).

Evidence suggests that failure to detect the pathogen diversity within the host can influence the clinical results. We aimed to investigate the effects of different genotypes in mixed infections and determine their relationship with heteroresistance in the treatment of Iranian tuberculosis patients.
Methods
One of the genotypes was identified in the culture and another genotype pattern in the mixed infection was predicted by comparing the pattern of MIRU-VNTR between the clinical specimens and their respective cultures in each patient. For all patients, the drug susceptibility testing was carried out on three single colonies from each clinical sample. The follow-up of patients was carried out during six months of treatment.
Results
Based on MIRU-VNTR profiles of clinical samples, we showed that 55.6% (25/45) of the Iranian patients included in the study had mixed infections. Patients with mixed infections had a higher rate of treatment failure, compared to others (P=0.03). By comparing clinical sample profiles to profiles obtained after culture, we were able to distinguish between major and hidden genotypes. Among hidden genotypes, Haarlem (L4.1.2) and Beijing (L2) were associated to treatment failure (6/8 patients).
Conclusions
To conclude, we propose a procedure using the MIRU-VNTR method to identify the different genotypes in mixed infections. The present findings suggest that genotypes with potentially higher pathogenicity may not be detected when performing experimental culture in patients with mixed infections."

To investigate the prevalence of high-risk (HR) human papillomavirus (HPV) and factors associated with HR-HPV infection among women from rural Eastern Cape, South Africa.
Methods
HPV prevalence was determined by Hybrid Capture 2 assay in cervical specimens from 417 women aged ≥30 years (median 46 years) recruited from the community health clinic in the Eastern Cape.
Results
HR-HPV prevalence was 28.5% (119/417), and HIV-positive women had significantly higher HR-HPV prevalence than HIV-negative women (40.6%, 63/155 vs 21.4%, 56/262, respectively; p = 0.001). HIV-positive status (odds ratio (OR) 2.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.63–3.90), having ≥3 lifetime sexual partners (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.16–3.89), having ≥1 sexual partner in the last month (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.21–2.92), ≥4 times frequency of vaginal sex in the past 1 month (OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.32–4.35), and having a vaginal discharge currently/in the previous week (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.18–3.85) increased the risk of HR-HPV infection. In the multivariate analysis, HIV positivity remained strongly associated with HR-HPV infection (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.17–3.22).
Conclusions
Risk factors related to sexual behaviors play a significant role in HR-HPV infection in this population. This report will inform health policymakers on HPV prevalence and contribute to discussions on the use of HPV testing as the primary cervical cancer screening test in South Africa."

To compare the efficacy and safety of standard-dose (SD) daptomycin with those of high-dose (HD) daptomycin in complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTIs) in an Asian population.
Materials and Methods
Patients from three medical centers diagnosed with cSSTIs were screened in the clinical information system. Patients included in the analysis were divided into two groups: those who received daptomycin at doses ≥ 6 mg/kg (HD group) and those receiving 4 mg/kg (SD group). The demographics and clinical treatment information were analyzed.
Results
Overall, 155 patients were recruited, including 108 patients in the SD group and 47 patients in the HD group. The rate of healthcare-associated infections was higher in the HD group (61.70% vs. 37.04%), demonstrating a statistically significant difference (P = 0.005). Compared with the SD group, the HD group had statistically significant early clinical stabilization (72.34% vs 52.78%, P = 0.023). The results of the multivariate analysis indicated that HD daptomycin was an independent effector for early clinical stabilization (HR=0.394, P < 0.001). The rate of drug-related adverse events was equally distributed in the HD and SD groups (36.17% vs. 26.85%, P = 0.243).
Conclusion
Compared with SD daptomycin, HD daptomycin increased the rate of early clinical stabilization in Asian patients with cSSTIs, whereas the incidence of adverse events did not increase."

Results
The incubation period in the tertiary group was longer than that in the imported and secondary groups (both p < 0.05). Fever was the most common symptom at the onset of illness (73.33%, 58.82%, and 68.42%, respectively), and half of the patients had a low-grade temperature (<38.0 °C) with a short duration of fever (<7 days). CT scans showed that most patients in the three groups had bilateral pneumonia (80.00%, 76.47%, and 73.68%, respectively). Ct values detected in the tertiary patients were similar to those for the imported and secondary groups at the time of admission (both p > 0.05). For the tertiary group, the viral load was undetectable in half of the patients (52.63%) on day 7, and in all patients on day 14.

Methods
Children were screened annually for TB exposure with a tuberculin skin test (TST) at age 1–8 years. If positive, they were investigated for active TB. If no active TB was found, they were treated with isoniazid for 4–6 months; they then underwent 6-monthly skin tests (which included two recombinant proteins) until negative and annual skin tests thereafter. From the age of 8 years, the yearly follow-up was performed using the skin test that included two recombinant proteins, either until they became negative, developed active TB, or turned 18 years.
Results
The annual incidence of TB in Russian children decreased from 19.1 per 100 000 population in 2001 to 8.3 per 100 000 population in 2018.

Serum levels of different immune mediators in patients with ZIKAV infection were measured at distinct stages of the disease, as well as in culture supernatants from human monocytes infected with a clinical ZIKAV isolate. We also looked for clinical features associated with specific immune signatures among symptomatic patients.
Results
We evaluated 23 ZIKAV-infected patients. Their mean age was 32 ± 8.3 years and 65% were female. ZIKAV patients showed elevated IL-9, IL-17A, and CXCL10 levels at acute stages of the disease. At day 28, levels of CCL4 and CCL5 were increased, whereas IL-1RA, CXCL8 and CCL2 were decreased. At baseline, IL-7 was increased among patients with headache, whereas CCL2, and CCL3 were decreased in patients with bleeding and rash, respectively. Our clinical ZIKAV isolate induced a broad immune response in monocytes that did not resemble the signature observed in ZIKAV patients.

Bordetella pertussis is a highly contagious respiratory agent and is the causative pathogen of pertussis, which primarily affects children. Current diagnostic techniques for this pathogen have a variety of limitations including a long culture time, low bacterial load, and lack of specificity.
Methods
This article reports the development of a one-tube nested quantitative real-time PCR assay using the locked nucleic acid (LNA) technique (LNA-OTN-q-PCR), targeting the BP485 gene and using a simple inexpensive extraction method. A total of 130 clinical samples from patients with clinically suspected pertussis, collected from the Children’s Hospital of Hebei, China, were tested by LNA-OTN-q-PCR assay. RT-PCR and two-step semi-nested PCR assays were performed in parallel for comparison.
Results
Only strains of B. pertussis were identified as positive, whereas all of the remaining strains were appropriately identified as negative by the LNA-OTN-q-PCR assay. A single copy per reaction can be detected by the LNA-OTN-q-PCR assay. Additionally, the sensitivity of this method was 100 times that of the RT-PCR assay (100 copies per reaction). Sixty-three of the 130 clinical samples were detected positive by LNA-OTN-q-PCR assay; in contrast, RT-PCR was able to detect only 41 positive samples. Following this, all 63 samples were positively identified by two-step semi-nested PCR. Compared with the two-step semi-nested PCR assay, both the specificity and sensitivity of the LNA-OTN-q-PCR assay using purified DNA and crude extract were 100%.
Conclusions
This assay was able to detect B. pertussis infection with high sensitivity and specificity. This test shows great potential as a promising technique to detect B. pertussis in both clinical laboratories and public health settings."

Several recent case reports have described common early chest imaging findings of lung pathology caused by 2019 novel Coronavirus (SARS-COV2) which appear to be similar to those seen previously in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infected patients.
Objective
We present some remarkable imaging findings of the first two patients identified in Italy with COVID-19 infection travelling from Wuhan, China. The follow-up with chest X-Rays and CT scans was also included, showing a progressive adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Results
Moderate to severe progression of the lung infiltrates, with increasing percentage of high-density infiltrates sustained by a bilateral and multi-segmental extension of lung opacities, were seen. During the follow-up, apart from pleural effusions, a tubular and enlarged appearance of pulmonary vessels with a sudden caliber reduction was seen, mainly found in the dichotomic tracts, where the center of a new insurgent pulmonary lesion was seen. It could be an early alert radiological sign to predict initial lung deterioration. Another uncommon element was the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy with short-axis oval nodes.
Conclusions
Although only two patients have been studied, these findings are consistent with the radiological pattern described in literature. Finally, the pulmonary vessels enlargement in areas where new lung infiltrates develop in the follow-up CT scan, could describe an early predictor radiological sign of lung impairment."

Infective endocarditis (IE) has high mortality, partly due to delayed diagnosis. No biomarker can identify IE in patients with fever and clinical picture of infection. To find putative biomarkers we analyzed serum levels of two proteins found in cardiac valves, fibulin-1 (n=696) and osteoprotegerin (n=689) among patients on clinical suspicion of IE. Proteomic analyses were performed in 24 patients with bacteremia, 12 patients with definite IE and 12 patients with excluded IE.
Methods
Fibulin-1 and osteoprotegerin were studied by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Proteomic analyses were conducted by 2-dimensional polyacrylamid gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and label-free quantitative liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (LFQ LC-MS/MS). Controls for 2D 2D-PAGE and LFQ LC-MS/MS had bacteremia and excluded IE.
Results
Osteoprotegerin levels were significantly increased in IE patients compared with non-IE patients. Fibulin-1 showed no difference. 2D-PAGE showed significant differences of 6 proteoforms: haptoglobin, haptoglobin-related protein, α-2-macroglobulin, apolipoprotein A-I and ficolin-3. LFQ LC-MS/MS analysis revealed significant level changes of 7 proteins: apolipoprotein L1, complement C1q subcomponent B and C, leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor subfamily A member 3, neuropilin-2, multimerin-1 and adiponectin.
Conclusions
The concentration changes in a set of proteoforms/proteins suggest that stress and inflammation responses are perturbed in patients with IE compared to patients with bacteremia without IE."

Elimination of mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been a global public health priority. In 2013, the World Health Organization recommended antiretroviral therapy administration to all HIV-positive pregnant and breastfeeding women regardless of the CD4 cell count or clinical stage, referred to ‘Option B+’. Ethiopia has had a high prevalence of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. The prevalence of transmission in breastfeeding mothers was 24% in 2012 and increased to more than 30% in 2015. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of HIV transmission and its associations among infants born to HIV-positive mothers who had enrolled with the five Amhara regional state referral hospitals’ prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission departments, Ethiopia.
Methods
The study used a retrospective single cohort design, and simple random sampling with proportional allocation to select the medical records of 217 exposed infants. The data collected from each hospital were documented from January 1, 2014 to May 30, 2017. The cumulative incidence and prevalence of HIV transmission among exposed infants in the region were presented using figures and tables.
Results
The prevalence of HIV transmission among exposed infants at enrollment to the program was 2.3% (five cases) (95% CI, 0.5–4.6%), whereas the prevalence of HIV transmission among exposed infants on completion of the program was 3.7% (8) (95% CI, 1.4–6.5%). The cumulative incidence of transmission on completing the program was 1.6% (3) (95% CI, 0.0–3.2%).
Conclusions
In contrast to the expected outcome of the World Health Organization’s ‘Option B+’ guidelines regarding HIV transmission, this study found the cumulative incidence of HIV transmission on completing the program and the overall prevalence of HIV infection to be high. Although some studies have reported significant reductions in mother-to-child transmission of HIV, there are still considerable challenges in preventing this transmission in the Amhara region."

A longitudinal cohort study performed in Cebu City, Philippines found that the presence of pre-existing chikungunya virus (CHIKV) neutralizing antibodies (NAb) was associated with a decreased risk of symptomatic CHIKV infection. However, the relationship between pre-existing NAb and the risk of subclinical seroconversion has not been well described.
Methods
Data were analyzed from a longitudinal cohort aged 6 months to 83 years who underwent active fever surveillance in Cebu City, Philippines from 2012 to 2014. Participants with a history of fever underwent acute and 3-week convalescent visits with blood collection, and annual visits at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months. Symptomatic CHIKV infections were detected by PCR of acute illness sera. Subclinical seroconversion was defined as a ≥8-fold rise in 80% plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT80) titer between annual visits without intervening symptomatic infection.
Results
Among 854 participants who completed the 12-month visit (year 1) and 765 who completed the 24-month visit (year 2), 25 symptomatic CHIKV infections and 104 subclinical seroconversions occurred among 615 individuals with no detectable pre-year NAb in year 1 and 444 in year 2, while no symptomatic infections and one subclinical seroconversion occurred in those with a pre-year PRNT80 titer ≥1:10. Pre-year PRNT80 titer ≥1:10 was associated with zero relative risk of symptomatic CHIKV infection and 0.018 risk of subclinical seroconversion.
Conclusions
The presence of detectable pre-existing CHIKV NAb correlated with a decreased risk of both symptomatic CHIKV infection and subclinical seroconversion. These findings support the potential use of CHIKV NAb titer as a surrogate endpoint of protection from infection for vaccine development."

To describe the incidence, case-fatality rate and pathogen distribution of late-onset sepsis (LOS) among preterm infants in China. To investigate risk factors and short-term outcomes associated with LOS caused by Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and fungi.
Methods
This cohort study included all infants born at <34 weeks’ gestation and admitted to 25 tertiary hospitals in 19 provinces in China from May, 2015 to April, 2018. Infants were excluded who died or were discharged within 3 days of being born.
Results
A total of 1199 episodes of culture-positive LOS were identified in 1133 infants, with an incidence of 4.4% (1133/25,725). Overall, 15.4% (175/1133) of infants with LOS died and 10.0% (113/1133) of infants died within 7 days of LOS onset. Among 1214 isolated pathogens, Gram-negative bacteria were the most common (51.8%, 629/1214) and fungi accounted for 17.1% (207/1214). Use of central lines, longer duration of antibiotics and previous carbapenem exposure were related to increased risk of fungal LOS compared with Gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria LOS was independently associated with increased risk of death, periventricular leukomalacia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Fungal LOS was independently associated with increased risk of periventricular leukomalacia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and necrotizing enterocolitis.
Conclusions
Late-onset sepsis was a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in Chinese neonatal intensive care units, with a distinct pathogen distribution from industrial countries. Clinical guidelines on the prevention and treatment of LOS should be developed and tailored to these LOS characteristics in Chinese neonatal intensive care units."

abstract = "An estimated 1.8 billion people worldwide have a latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), with wide variations in LTBI rates across countries. LTBI can be due to infection with either drug-sensitive or drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains. Accurate data on the prevalence of LTBI due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mtb strains are unavailable, since the strains cannot be isolated for resistance testing. There are no ‘gold standard’ tests for accurately diagnosing LTBI. Only three tests are currently available and approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the diagnosis of LTBI: the now outdated tuberculin skin test (TST), developed a century year ago, and the two interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) developed and rolled out over the past decade, the QuantiFERON (Qiagen, Germany) and T-SPOT.TB (Oxford Immunotec, United Kingdom) tests. These latter tests are not ideal due to issues of sensitivity, specificity, inability to distinguish infection with MDR-Mtb strains, and high costs. Achieving the WHO End TB Strategy target of an 80% reduction in global TB incidence by 2030 will require a major reduction in the number of persons with LTBI progressing to active TB disease. Critical to this will be the development of new diagnostic tests that are better than currently available LTBI tests at predicting who is at risk of progression to active TB disease. The diagnostic product development portfolio for LTBI appears to have reached the end of the road. Every attempt to make optimal use of currently available IGRAs using WHO LTBI guidelines for LTBI testing and treatment must be made to achieve WHO End TB strategy targets."

The present study evaluated factors associated with losses in the latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) cascade of care in contacts of tuberculosis (TB) patients, in a referral center from a highly endemic region in Brazil.
Methods
Contacts of 1672 TB patients were retrospectively studied between 2009 and 2014. Data on TB screening by clinical investigation, radiographic examination and tuberculin skin test (TST) were extracted from medical records. Losses in the cascade of care and TB incidence within 2-year follow-up were calculated.
Results
From a total of 1180 TB contacts initially identified, only 495 were examined (58% loss), and 20 were diagnosed with active TB at this stage. Furthermore, 435 persons returned for TST result interpretation and 351 (∼81%) were TST positive. Among those with positive TST, 249 (73%) were treated with isoniazid for 6 months whereas 51 abandoned therapy early. Three individuals who did not receive LTBI treatment, one with incomplete treatment and another who completed treatment developed active TB. A logistic regression analysis revealed that increases in age were associated with losses in the LTBI cascade independent of other clinical and epidemiological characteristics.
Conclusions
Major losses occur at initial stages and older patients are at higher risk of not completing the LTBI cascade of care."

abstract = "Objectives
Effective methods for diagnosing urogenital tuberculosis (UGTB) are important for its clinical management. Therefore, we undertook a systematic review to assess the performance of the urine-based Xpert MTB/RIF assay for UGTB.
Methods
PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane library, and Scopus were systematically searched up to July 30, 2019. A hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) was applied to calculate the pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), and odds ratio (OR) for the diagnostic accuracy of the Xpert test.
Results
Our search identified 858 unique articles from which 69 studies were selected for full-text revision, with 12 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Eleven studies comprising 1202 samples compared Xpert with mycobacterial culture, while 924 samples from eight studies compared it with a composite reference standard (CRS). The values for pooled sensitivity, specificity, PLR, NLR, and OR were 0.89, 0.95, 20.1, 0.18, and 159.53, respectively, when compared with the mycobacterial culture. Likewise, when compared with a CRS, the respective pooled sensitivity, specificity, PLR, NLR, and OR values were 0.55, 0.99, 40.67, 0.43, and 166.17, thereby suggesting a high level of accuracy for diagnosing UGTB. A meta-regression and sub-group analysis of TB-burden countries, study design, decontamination, concentration, and reference standard could not explain the heterogeneity (p > 0.05) in the diagnostic efficiency.
Conclusions
Our results suggested that Xpert is a promising diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of UGTB via urine specimen."

TPT is widely recommended for high-risk populations including HIV-infected and household contacts globally, but is not widely used. Historical trials on risk groups as well as the general population have documented a marked effect on reductions in incidence of active disease among those treated, as well as on prevalence of latent TB infection (LTBI) in populations where massive roll-out of TPT has previously taken place. This review summarizes the results of large historical trials conducted more than 50 years ago among Inuit and African populations as well as risk groups in the USA and Europe exhibiting similarities with current high-burden populations with current limited use of TPT. The trials demonstrated a 27–95% reduction in incidence of active TB among those receiving preventive treatment compared with placebo, with efficacy depending somewhat on length of treatment but mostly on adherence rates. It was possible to achieve satisfactory adherence rates in most of the trial populations and liver toxicity rates were generally low. The historical trials on preventive treatment for LTBI have documented that large-scale TPT is possible and effective even in high-burden populations in high-incidence areas and is therefore a relevant tool to consider in striving to eliminate the TB epidemic."

This study aimed at examining the socio-demographic, environmental and behavioural determinants of diarrhoea in children under five years in Kenya.
Methods
The study entailed an analysis of secondary data from the Kenya Demographic Health Survey (DHS) 2014 using STATA Corp 2010. A total of 19,889 children <5 years were in the study, out of whom 2,906 had diarrhoea in the last two weeks prior to the survey. Descriptive analysis of independent variables and logistic regression model was used to analyse risk factors associated with diarrhoea in children <5 years.
Results
The most significant risk factors (p < 0.05) associated with diarrhoea morbidity in children <5 years were child age (AOR 2.26 95% CI 1.64, 3.11), low level of caregiver’s education (AOR 1.45 95% CI 1.11, 1.90) and unsafe disposal of children’s faeces (AOR 1.29 95% CI 1.03, 1.61). Wealthier households (AOR 0.83 95% CI 0.68, 1) were protective for diarrhoea in children <5 years.
Conclusion
Increasing caregiver education, wealthier households and promoting hygienic behaviours in poor households were associated with reducing diarrhoea. Programmes aimed at reducing diarrhoea may achieve better results in targeting caregivers with children in high risk age cohorts of 6–23 months."

The aim of this study was to assess the influence of renal function, in particular the presence of augmented renal clearance (ARC), on the pharmacokinetics of linezolid in critically ill patients. The effect of continuous infusion on the probability of therapeutic success from a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) perspective was also evaluated.
Methods
Seventeen patients received linezolid (600 mg every 12 h) as a 30-min infusion and 26 as a continuous infusion (50 mg/h). The PK parameters were calculated and the probability of PK/PD target attainment (PTA) was estimated by Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) for different doses administered by intermittent (600 mg every 12 h or 600 mg every 8 h) or continuous infusion (50 mg/h or 75 mg/h).
Results
In patients without ARC, the standard dose was adequate to attain the PK/PD target. However, linezolid clearance was significantly higher in ARC patients, leading to sub-therapeutic concentrations. Continuous infusion (50 mg/h) provided concentrations ≥2 mg/l in 70% of the ARC patients. MCS revealed that concentrations ≥2 mg/l would be reached in >90% of patients receiving 75 mg/h.
Conclusions
ARC increases linezolid clearance and leads to a high risk of underexposure with the standard dose. Continuous infusion increases the PTA, but an infusion rate of 75 mg/h should be considered to ensure concentrations ≥2 mg/ml."

This study aimed to verify the frequency, genotypes, and etiological role of Human Bocavirus (HBoV) in younger Amazonian children with either acute gastroenteritis (AGE) or respiratory infections (ARI). The influence of Rotarix™ vaccination and co-infection status was also investigated.
Design
HBoV quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) testing was done on both fecal and saliva (1468 samples) from 734 children < 5 months old living in the Amazon (Brazil, Guyana, and Venezuela). High and median HBoV viral load samples were used for extraction, nested PCR amplification, and sequencing for genotyping. HBoV mRNA detection was done by reverse transcription following DNA amplification.
Results
The overall HBoV frequencies were 14.2% (69/485; AGE) and 14.1% (35/249; ARI) (p = 0.83). HBoV exclusively infected 4.5% (22/485; AGE) and 4% (10/249) of the Amazonian children (Odds ratios 1.13, 95% confidence interval= 2.42-0.52). HBoV 1 was mainly detected in feces and saliva from AGE children; and HBoV2, from ARI children. HBoV mRNA was detected only in feces. The Rotarix™ vaccination status did not affect the HBoV frequencies.
Conclusions
We suggest that, after entry into the air/oral pathways, HBoV1 continues infecting toward the intestinal tract causing AGE. HBoV2 can be a causative agent of AGE and ARI in younger Amazonian children."

The infectious diseases team at Kameda Medical Center, Japan, implemented a new outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) program in July 2012 and expanded the program with the support of home care services. This study reviews the OPAT program after 5.5 years of operation.
Methods
We prospectively collected data about the age, sex, diagnoses, causative organisms, types of OPAT, modes of administration, selected antibiotics, treatment durations, bed days saved, outcomes, readmissions, and estimated cost reductions of all patients who were treated in the OPAT program from July 2012 to December 2017.
Results
Of the 66 patients treated under the OPAT program, 45 (68.2%) were treated using clinic OPAT, and 21 (31.8%) were treated using homecare OPAT. The most commonly targeted organism was methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Continuous infusion with elastomeric pumps was employed in 55 patients (83.3%). Cefazolin was the most frequently used antibiotic (39.4%), followed by penicillin G (24.2%). The median OPAT duration was 13 days (range, 3–51), and the total bed days saved was 923. The estimated medical cost reduction was approximately 87,000 US dollars.
Conclusions
Our experience shows that OPAT is a safe and feasible practice not only for efficient bed utilization and medical cost savings but also for better antimicrobial stewardship."

Detailed knowledge of old non-pharmacological therapies might support physicians and researchers in the identification of new solutions for difficult-to-treat patients. We performed a narrative literature review on the main old therapeutic options prescribed for patients with TB. The main recommendations and contraindications of sanatorium therapies (i.e., bed rest, fresh air, sunlight) and pulmonary collapse techniques are reviewed, evaluating their physiological basis and their impact on patient outcomes.

The performance of the investigational-use-only version of the BioFire FilmArray Pneumonia Panel (FA-Pneumo), a high-order nested multiplex PCR, was evaluated for the detection of typical respiratory bacterial pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes in sputa and endotracheal aspirate (ETA) specimens.
Methods
Thirty-one sputa and 69 ETA specimens were analyzed. The diagnostic performance of FA-Pneumo was assessed using routine microbiological methods as the reference standard.
Results
Overall sensitivity and specificity for organism detection using FA-Pneumo were 98.5% and 76.5%, respectively. The sensitivity for each pathogen was 100%, except for Klebsiella aerogenes, and the range of specificity was 83.3–99.0%. FA-Pneumo detected antimicrobial resistance genes in 17 out of 18 specimens (94.4%) that were resistant by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. FA-Pneumo additionally detected 25 resistance genes in 22 specimens, and sequencing for the presence of resistance genes confirmed the majority of these results (20/25, 80%). Semi-quantitative analysis of bacterial nucleic acid amounts by FA-Pneumo revealed that 88.2% of the identified bacteria (67/76) with ≥106 copies/ml also gave culture-positive results with significant amounts of bacteria.
Conclusions
FA-Pneumo is a rapid test with high sensitivity for the detection of bacteria and antimicrobial resistance genes in sputum and ETA specimens and could aid in determining antibiotic therapy."

We reviewed the literature on historical developments and current diagnostic capability worldwide, to identify knowledge gaps and instill urgency to address them.
Methods
Searches were performed in Web of Science and PubMed using the term 'Japanese encephalitis' up to 13th October 2019. Studies reporting laboratory-confirmed symptomatic JE cases in humans were included, and data on details of diagnostic tests were extracted. A JE case was classified according to confirmatory levels (Fischer et al., 2008; Campbell et al., 2011; Pearce et al., 2018; Heffelfinger et al., 2017), where level 1 represented the highest level of confidence.
Findings
20,212 published JE cases were identified from 205 studies. 15,167 (75%) of these positive cases were confirmed with the lowest-confidence diagnostic tests (level 3 or 4, or level 4). Only 109 (53%) of the studies reported contemporaneous testing for dengue-specific antibodies.

abstract = "Objectives
Hepatitis B is endemic in Lao PDR with 8–10% of the adult population being chronically infected. We investigated the impact of hepatitis B vaccination on infection in adolescents born shortly before and after the introduction of the vaccine in 2001.
Methods
779 students from Vientiane Capital and Bolikhamxay province were tested for HBV markers by ELISA. Socio-demographic information was collected with a standardized questionnaire. Predictors/risk factors for seroprotection or exposure to hepatitis B infection were assessed by bivariate and multivariable analyses.
Results
The prevalence of a serological vaccination profile increased significantly after the introduction of the vaccine (13.2%–21.9%, p < 0.05, in Vientiane; 3.0%–19.7%, p < 0.001, in Bolikhamxay), which translated into at least a 2-times lower prevalence of past infection. In logistic regression, older students in Bolikhamxay were less likely to be vaccinated and more likely to have been infected by HBV in the past.
Conclusion
Even though this study documented a sizable and lasting reduction in past hepatitis B infections in adolescents born after the introduction of infant hepatitis B vaccination, the overall levels of protective anti-HBs were low and warrant at least the introduction of a booster for adolescents. Furthermore, we suggest improving the coverage of the hepatitis B birth dose."

abstract = "Objectives
As a global pandemic is inevitable, real-time monitoring of transmission is vital for containing the spread of COVID-19. The main objective of this study was to report the real-time effective reproduction numbers (R(t)) and case fatality rates (CFR) in Europe.
Methods
Data for this study were obtained mainly from the World Health Organization website, up to March 9, 2020. R(t) were estimated by exponential growth rate (EG) and time-dependent (TD) methods. ‘R0’ package in R was employed to estimate R(t) by fitting the existing epidemic curve. Both the naïve CFR (nCFR) and adjusted CFR (aCFR) were estimated.
Results
With the EG method, R(t) was 3.27 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.17–3.38) for Italy, 6.32 (95% CI 5.72–6.99) for France, 6.07 (95% CI 5.51–6.69) for Germany, and 5.08 (95% CI 4.51–5.74) for Spain. With the TD method, the R value for March 9 was 3.10 (95% CI 2.21–4.11) for Italy, 6.56 (95% CI 2.04–12.26) for France, 4.43 (95% CI 1.83–7.92) for Germany, and 3.95 (95% CI 0–10.19) for Spain.
Conclusions
This study provides important findings on the early outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe. Due to the recent rapid increase in new cases of COVID-19, real-time monitoring of the transmissibility and mortality in Spain and France is a priority."

abstract = "Objectives
Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a public health threat for several tropical countries, including Brazil. Therapy failures and relapses aggravate VL morbidity and mortality. Our study aimed at identifying predictors of relapse and thus contributes to directing therapeutic options and patient follow-up.
Methods
A nonconcurrent cohort of 571 subjects who completed successful therapy for VL in the city of Bauru, São Paulo State, Brazil, was followed for 24 months in order to identify the incidence and predictors of relapse. Extensive review of medical charts and laboratory files was conducted. Univariate and multivariable Cox regression models were used to identify predictors for the outcome of interest. A hierarchical strategy was used for variable selection in multivariable models.
Results
Relapses occurred in 6.8% of treated subjects, after a median of 6 months (interquartile range, 4–9). In a comprehensive multivariable model, relapse was associated with: HIV-coinfection (hazard ratio [HR], 7.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.58–21.55); the presence of lower limb edema (HR, 6.06; 95%CI, 1.38–26.77) and low platelet count upon admission (HR for platelet count × 1000, 0.99; 95%CI, 0.98–0.99) ; and secondary pneumonia (HR, 5.49; 95%CI, 1.49–20.18). On the other hand, therapy with Liposomal Amphotericin (as opposed to Antimoniate) was not independently associated with relapse (HR, 5.97; 95%CI, 0.63–56.29).
Conclusion
Besides reinforcing the impact of HIV coinfection on the outcome of VL, our study points to clinical and laboratory findings that characterize patients who were more likely to relapse. Those groups should be more closely followed, and possibly could benefit from novel therapeutic options."

The aim of this study was to develop and internally validate a treatment failure risk nomogram in a Chinese population of patients with Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis with surgical therapy.
Methods
We developed a prediction model based on a dataset of 132 drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) patients. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression model was used to optimize feature selection for the treatment failure risk model. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was applied to build a predicting model incorporating the feature selected in the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression model. Discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness of the predicting model were assessed using the C-index, calibration plot, and decision curve analysis. Internal validation was assessed using the bootstrapping validation.
Findings
Predictors contained in the prediction nomogram included Lesion, Treatment history, Recurrent chest infection (RCI) and Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) or Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). The model displayed good discrimination with a C-index of 0.905 and good calibration. A high C-index value of 0.876 could still be reached in the interval validation. Decision curve analysis showed that the nomogram was clinically useful when an intervention was decided at the treatment failure possibility threshold of 1%.
Interpretation
This study developed a novel nomogram with relatively good accuracy to help clinicians access the risk of treatment failure in MDR/XDR-TB patients when starting surgery. With an estimate of individual risk, clinicians and patients can make more suitable decisions regarding surgery. This nomogram requires external validation, and further research is needed to determine whether the nomogram is appropriate for predicting surgery risk in MDR/XDR-TB patients."

Acute viral gastroenteritis is a major public health concern, especially among children younger than 5 years of age. The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of human astrovirus infection in children with acute gastroenteritis.
Methods
Stool specimens were collected from 506 children under 5 years of age hospitalized with acute diarrhoea (289 male and 208 female), and human astrovirus was investigated by RT-PCR. Associations of socio-demographic, clinical, and behavioural conditions with infection were analysed.
Results
The overall prevalence of human astrovirus was found to be 10.3%. The mean age of positive cases was 12.41 ± 6.21 months and this was associated with infection (p = 0.013). Children >18 months of age were at three times the risk of infection when compared to those aged 0–6 months (odds ratio (OR) 3.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15–8.88; p = 0.026). Children living in houses with more than one room (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.28–0.96; p = 0.036) and mothers using treated water (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.25–0.86; p = 0.015) were associated with reduced infection.
Conclusions
In this study, infection with astrovirus was common in acute gastroenteritis cases among children younger than 5 years of age. Drinking treated water and living in non-crowded environments protected the children from infection."

Pneumococcal disease is a major public health concern globally and particularly in Burkina Faso, where the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was introduced nationwide into the routine immunization schedule in 2013. The aim of this study was to evaluate vaccine impact on all-cause pneumonia hospitalizations among children <5 years of age.
Methods
Hospitalization data covering a 10-year period (January 1, 2009–December 31, 2018) were collected retrospectively in four rural district hospitals, using medical records to extract data on relevant variables. Using an interrupted time-series design and segmented regression, the effectiveness and impact of PCV13 on the rates of pneumonia hospitalization were estimated. Severe acute malnutrition and unintentional injury were used as control conditions.
Results
Vaccine effectiveness was found to be 34% (95% confidence interval (CI) 16–49%, p=0.001), 24% (95% CI 2–41%, p=0.032), and 50% (95% CI 30–64%, p<0.001) against all-cause pneumonia among children <5 years, <2 years, and 2–4 years of age, respectively. By October 2018, PCV13 introduction had led to an absolute reduction in the pneumonia hospitalization rate of 348 cases per 100000 person-years among children <5 years of age. No decline was observed for the control conditions.
Conclusions
These estimates point to a substantial public health impact of PCV13 against pneumonia hospitalization among children aged <5 years in Burkina Faso."

Clinical scores are promising case-finding tools for tuberculosis (TB) among HIV-infected patients. The Bandim TBscore has been shown to increase the diagnostic yield among patients with presumed TB in general, but has not previously been tested among newly diagnosed HIV patients at high risk of TB.
Methods
HIV-infected patients were included in this cross-sectional study. A pre–post-intervention study design was used to assess the outcome of a change in practice, i.e. the application of a clinical score (TBscore) consisting of 13 signs and symptoms to assess the need for further TB diagnostics. Patients with a TBscore ≥2 were evaluated using smear microscopy and Xpert MTB/RIF. A TB diagnosis was made based on microbiology or clinical evaluation. The sensitivity and specificity of the TBscore were compared with those of World Health Organization symptoms.
Results
The TB prevalence among newly enrolled HIV-infected patients during the study period was 13.4% (22/164). Using the TBscore and a diagnostic algorithm, it was possible to increase the proportion of patients started on TB treatment from 2.7% (10/367) the year before the study to 10.4% (17/164) during the study period. Five patients diagnosed with TB were not started on TB treatment as they were lost to follow-up or died. With a cut-off value of 2, the TBscore had a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 95.5% (21/22), 36.9% (41/111), 23.1% (22/118), and 97.6% (41/42), respectively.

The objectives were to estimate the prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) among household contacts (HHCs) with active TB patients, and to identify their risk factors.
Methods
A prospective, cross sectional study was conducted from May to October 2018. All HHCs with active TB cases were included. The subjects underwent two tests: Quantiferon TB-Gold plus assay (QFT-Plus) and tuberculin skin test (TST). Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences 25.
Results
Among 521 HHCs, 101 (24.05%) revealed positive TST and 80 (19.85%) positive QFT-Plus. The significant risk factors associated with positive TST individuals were ≥ 15 years, immunosuppressive therapy, and pulmonary TB (PTB) patients; whereas, those with QFT-Plus positive were ≥ 45 years, alcohol consumption, and immunosuppressive therapy. The concordance rate among 309 individuals who performed both tests was 0.88 %; the kappa value showed good agreement (k = 0.679) and significant correlation (P < 0.001).
Conclusions
The overall rate of LTBI was intermediate. Screening of LTBI should be routine among HHCs, regardless of the site of the disease. Age ≥ 15 years, alcoholics, immunosuppressive therapy, and PTB were potential risk factors. There was a good concordance between TST and QFT-Plus. A QFT-Plus can overcome the limitation of a BCG vaccinated individual, especially in early life."

Results
Fifty patients were enrolled. The most common symptoms were fever, headache, and vomiting. Five of these patients died and five had visual impairment sequelae; nine of these patients were treated before 2010. Correlation analysis suggested that cerebral hernia, consciousness disorder, visual impairment, hydrocephalus, and an intracranial pressure >300mmH2O in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were associated with a poor prognosis. Whether or not the application of intrathecal administration had little effect on prognosis. Early surgical intervention with internal drainage helped to reduce the mortality and incidence of visual impairment sequelae, whether or not Cryptococcus was present in the CSF before surgery.
Conclusions
Clinically, the presence of a cerebral hernia, consciousness disorder, hydrocephalus, visual impairment, or intracranial pressure >300mmH2O often indicates a poor prognosis in patients with CM. The prognosis improved significantly after 2010, following an adjustment of the treatment strategy. Early internal drainage is the key factor, and CSF positive for Cryptococcus before surgery is not a contraindication."

Evidence regarding biomarkers for risk prediction in patients with infective endocarditis (IE) is limited. We aimed to investigate the value of a panel of biomarkers for the prediction of in-hospital mortality in patients with IE.
Methods
Between 2016 and 2018, consecutive IE patients admitted to the emergency department were prospectively included. Blood concentrations of nine biomarkers were measured at admission (D0) and on the seventh day (D7) of antibiotic therapy: C-reactive protein (CRP), sensitive troponin I (s-cTnI), procalcitonin, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), interleukin 6 (IL6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), proadrenomedullin, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, and galectin 3. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality.
Results
Among 97 patients, 56% underwent cardiac surgery, and in-hospital mortality was 27%. At admission, six biomarkers were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality: s-cTnI (OR 3.4; 95%CI 1.8–6.4; P<0.001), BNP (OR 2.7; 95%CI 1.4–5.1; P=0.002), IL-6 (OR 2.06; 95%CI 1.3–3.7; P=0.019), procalcitonin (OR 1.9; 95%CI 1.1–3.2; P=0.018), TNF-α (OR 1.8; 95%CI 1.1–2.9; P=0.019), and CRP (OR 1.8; 95%CI 1.0–3.3; P=0.037). At admission, S-cTnI provided the highest accuracy for predicting mortality (area under the ROC curve: s-cTnI 0.812, BNP 0.727, IL-6 0.734, procalcitonin 0.684, TNF-α 0.675, CRP 0.670).

Patients with liver dysfunction in the intensive care unit (ICU) were included prospectively. The Child–Pugh score was used to categorize the degree of liver dysfunction. The initial intravenous VRC dosing regimen comprised a loading dose of 300 mg every 12 h for the first 24 h, followed by 200 mg every 12 h. The first PK curves (PK curve 1) were drawn within one dosing interval of the first dose for 17 patients; the second PK curves (PK curve 2) were drawn within one dosing interval after a minimum of seven doses for 12 patients. PK parameters were estimated by non-compartmental analysis.
Results
There were good correlations between the area under the curve (AUC0–12) of PK curve 2 and the corresponding trough concentration (C0) and peak concentration (Cmax) (r2 = 0.951 and 0.963, respectively; both p < 0.001). The median half-life (t1/2) and clearance (CL) of patients in Child–Pugh class A (n = 3), B (n = 5), and C (n = 4) of PK curve 2 were 24.4 h and 3.31 l/h, 29.1 h and 2.54 l/h, and 60.7 h and 2.04 l/h, respectively. In the different Child–Pugh classes, the CL (median) of PK curve 2 were all lower than those of PK curve 1. The apparent steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) of PK curve 1 was positively correlated with actual body weight (r2 = 0.450, p = 0.004). The median first C0 of 17 patients determined on day 5 was 5.27 (2.61) μg/ml, and 29.4% of C0 exceeded the upper limit of the therapeutic window (2–6 μg/ml).
Conclusions
The CL of VRC decreased with increasing severity of liver dysfunction according to the Child–Pugh classification, along with an increased t1/2, which resulted in high plasma exposure of VRC. Adjusted dosing regimens of intravenous VRC should be established based on Child–Pugh classes for these ICU patients, and plasma concentrations should be monitored closely to avoid serious adverse events."

To investigate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with abnormal imaging findings.
Methods
Patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Zhejiang province from January 17 to February 8 who had undergone CT or X-ray were enrolled. Epidemiological and clinical data were analyzed among those with abnormal or normal imaging findings.
Results
Excluding 72 patients with normal images, 230 of 573 patients showed abnormalities affecting more than two lung lobes. The median radiographic score was 2.0, and there was a negative correlation between that score and the oxygenation index (ρ = −0.657, P < 0.001). Patients with abnormal images were older (46.65 ± 13.82), with a higher rate of coexisting condition (28.8%), a lower rate of exposure history, and longer time between onset and confirmation (5 days) than non-pneumonia patients (all P < 0.05). A higher rate of fever, cough, expectoration and headache, a lower level of lymphocytes, albumin, and serum sodium levels and a higher total bilirubin, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein levels and a lower oxygenation index were observed in pneumonia patients (all P < 0.05). Muscle ache, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, lower lymphocytes levels, and higher serum creatinine and radiographic score at admission were predictive factors for the severe/critical subtype.
Conclusion
Patients with abnormal images have more obvious clinical manifestations and laboratory changes. Combing clinical features and radiographic scores can effectively predict severe/critical types."

abstract = "Background and objective
The human ficolin-2, encoded by FCN2, recognizes pathogen-associated acetylated residues on their cell surfaces and activates the lectin complement cascade. This study aimed to investigate the contribution of human ficolin-2 and the functional FCN2 genetic variants in dengue virus (DENV) infection and in clinical progression.
Methods
FCN2 genetic polymorphisms in the promoter, intron 7 and exon 8 were genotyped in 279 patients with dengue fever and in 200 healthy controls by direct Sanger sequencing. The ficolin-2 levels were measured in serum samples by ELISA and correlated with clinical data.
Results
The frequencies of +6031GG, +6220GG and +6424TT genotypes were significantly higher in dengue patients compared to healthy controls indicating an increased risk of dengue fever. The SNPs rs11103563 (+6031A/G), rs7872508 (+6220 T/G), and rs7851696 (+6424G/T) significantly regulated ficolin-2 levels in dengue patients (P < 0.0001). Ficolin-2 levels were increased in patients with dengue and Dengue with Warning Signs (DWS) compared to healthy controls (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.038, respectively). Ficolin-2 levels were significantly increased after 10–14 days of admission in both dengue and DWS patients and then slightly decreased after three weeks of discharge, indicating that ficolin-2 levels were modulated during the progression of dengue fever. In addition, ficolin-2 levels were negatively correlated with AST levels and positively correlated with platelet counts.
Conclusions
FCN2 polymorphisms are associated with dengue fever in the Vietnamese population. Ficolin-2 levels are modulated during the progression of dengue fever and correlated with clinical parameters and thus may play a possible role in the pathogenesis of DENV infection."

Evaluate the role of porins in the susceptibility of Klebsiella pneumoniae to ceftaroline and ceftaroline-avibactam.
Methods
Susceptibility to ceftaroline and ceftaroline-avibactam was tested by broth microdilution method in Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (n = 65), including isogenic mutants (n = 30) and clinical isolates (n = 35), with different outer membrane porin defects in the presence or absence of beta lactamases.
Results
Ceftaroline exhibited excellent activity against all the isogenic porin mutants with a MIC range of 0.125–0.25 μg/ml. Ceftaroline showed limited activity in the presence of extended spectrum β-lactamase enzymes in isogenic mutant constructs as expected but regained effectiveness in combination with avibactam against these isolates except those carrying metallo-carbapenemase (IMP-4) with an MIC range of 0.25–>32 μg/ml. Ceftaroline-avibactam was able to inhibit 86% of the clinical isolates (n = 35) of Klebsiella pneumoniae carrying porin defects and multiple beta lactamases with only four isolates showing raised MICs against the combination (MIC range 0.125–4 μg/ml). One clinical isolate with IMP-4 carbapenemase had an MIC value of >32 μg/ml.
Conclusion
Outer membrane porins play a key role in the transport of ceftaroline inKlebsiella pneumoniae but it remains effective in isolates with altered permeability due to common porin mutations. The addition of avibactam substantially enhances the potency of ceftaroline providing an effective remedy to the problem of omnipresent beta lactamases in these bacteria."

There are limited data about Xpert-Ultra performance in different settings, in HIV-infected persons, in those with a history of previous TB, and with trace readouts.
Methods
We evaluated the relative accuracy of Xpert-MTB/RIF and Xpert-Ultra in 272 selected but well-characterized archived sputum samples. Of these, 168 were culture-positive (64/168 smear-positive and 104/168 smear-negative), and 104 were culture-negative (102/104 from patients with previous TB and 2/104 from patients without a TB history). Assay-specific limit-of-detection (LOD) experiments were conducted using serial dilutions of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv.
Results
Overall sensitivity (95%CI) in smear-negative culture-positive samples for Xpert-MTB/RIF and Xpert-Ultra were 71.2% (62.5–79.9) and 77% (68.9–85.1), respectively (and in HIV-infected persons: 63.5% (50–76.1) and 73.1% (61.1–85.2), respectively). The LOD for Xpert-Ultra was lower (9 versus 184 CFU/ml). There were a total of 9/272 (3.3%) Xpert Ultra trace readouts (6/104 [5.8%]) in smear-negative culture-positive persons, and 3/102 (3%) in culture-negative non-TB persons with a history of previous TB).
Conclusions
Xpert-Ultra had a lower LOD compared to Xpert-MTB/RIF. A small proportion of samples (<5%) from culture-negative patients but with a history of previous TB had a likely false-positive trace readout. These data inform the management of patients with suspected TB in endemic settings."

This study aimed to evaluate whether tenofovir prophylaxis for mothers with high viral loads in late pregnancy is a cost-effective way to prevent mother-to-child hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission in China.
Methods
A decision tree Markov model was constructed for a cohort of infants born to HBV surface antigen-positive mothers in China, 2016. The expected cost and effectiveness were compared between the current active-passive immunoprophylaxis strategy and the tenofovir prophylaxis strategy, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated. One-way and multi-way probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
Results
For 100,000 babies born to mothers positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, tenofovir prophylaxis strategy will prevent 2213 perinatal HBV infections and will gain 931 quality-adjusted life years when compared with the current active-passive immunoprophylaxis strategy. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was ￥59,973 ($9087) per quality-adjusted life years gained. This result was robust over a wide range of assumptions.
Conclusions
Tenofovir prophylaxis for mothers with high viral loads in late pregnancy was found to be more cost-effective than the current active-passive immunoprophylaxis alone. Embedding tenofovir prophylaxis for mothers with high virus loads into the present hepatitis B prevention strategies should be considered to further prevent mother-to-child hepatitis B transmission in China."

Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is estimated to cause 181 000 deaths annually, with the majority occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa. Flucytosine is recommended by the World Health Organization as part of the treatment for CM. Widespread use of flucytosine could reduce mortality in hospital by as much as 40% compared to the standard of care, yet due to market failure, quality-assured flucytosine remains unregistered and largely inaccessible throughout Africa.
Methods
The recently established South African flucytosine clinical access programme is an attempt to address the market failure that led to a lack of public sector access to flucytosine for CM, by making the medicine freely available to tertiary hospitals in South Africa.
Results
Between November 2018 and September 2019, 327 CM patients received flucytosine through this programme, with efforts to support sustainable national scale-up presently ongoing. We describe why this programme was needed, its catalytic potential, what is still required to ensure widespread access to flucytosine, and observations from this experience that may have wider relevance.
Conclusions
The South African flucytosine access programme illustrates how access programmes may be one part of the solution to addressing the vicious cycle of perceived low demand, limiting manufacturer interest in specific product markets."

abstract = "Backgrounds
Up to February 16, 2020, 355 cases have been confirmed as having COVID-19 infection on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. It is of crucial importance to estimate the reproductive number (R0) of the novel virus in the early stage of outbreak and make a prediction of daily new cases on the ship.
Method
We fitted the reported serial interval (mean and standard deviation) with a gamma distribution and applied “earlyR” package in R to estimate the R0 in the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak. We applied “projections” package in R to simulate the plausible cumulative epidemic trajectories and future daily incidence by fitting the data of existing daily incidence, a serial interval distribution, and the estimated R0 into a model based on the assumption that daily incidence obeys approximately Poisson distribution determined by daily infectiousness.
Results
The Maximum-Likelihood (ML) value of R0 was 2.28 for COVID-19 outbreak at the early stage on the ship. The median with 95% confidence interval (CI) of R0 values was 2.28 (2.06–2.52) estimated by the bootstrap resampling method. The probable number of new cases for the next ten days would gradually increase, and the estimated cumulative cases would reach 1514 (1384–1656) at the tenth day in the future. However, if R0 value was reduced by 25% and 50%, the estimated total number of cumulative cases would be reduced to 1081 (981–1177) and 758 (697–817), respectively.
Conclusion
The median with 95% CI of R0 of COVID-19 was about 2.28 (2.06–2.52) during the early stage experienced on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The future daily incidence and probable outbreak size is largely dependent on the change of R0. Unless strict infection management and control are taken, our findings indicate the potential of COVID-19 to cause greater outbreak on the ship."

The aim was to examine rubella seronegativity among women of childbearing age after the introduction of rubella-containing vaccine (RCV) among teenage girls and universal MMR programs in South Korea.
Methods
The serum IgG data of 72 114 women aged 20–49 years, who had undergone rubella antibody testing at the Gangnam CHA Medical Center between 2004 and 2018, were examined. A serum IgG level <10.0 IU/ml was considered negative. The study population was divided into three cohorts based on the vaccination policy: cohort 1, 1955–1976 (no national immunization program); cohort 2, 1977–1985 (national rubella only vaccination for high schoolers); cohort 3, 1986–1993 (combination strategy). We compared the rate of seronegativity and the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of seronegativity of each cohort.
Results
The overall proportion of seronegative women decreased significantly, from 6.1% in 2004 to 2.5% in 2018 (Kendall tau = −0.89, p < 0.001). The rate of seronegativity was highest among women who were not targeted for national immunization (born in 1955–1977, 5.2%), while it was lowest among candidates receiving routine and catch-up vaccinations (born in 1986–1993, 2.2%). When controlling for the effect of age and year of testing, the OR for seronegativity was lower for cohort 2 (adjusted OR 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60–0.76) and cohort 3 (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.40–0.75) when compared to cohort 1.
Conclusions
Women who were covered by either vaccination program were less susceptible to rubella infection, supporting the value of both approaches. The study findings will serve as empirical evidence for an immunization program targeted towards young women and children."

Results
Twelve patients were in mild group and 22 were in moderate group (non-severe group, n=34), and 21 patients were in severe group. At the end of the first two weeks after admission, clinical manifestations had completely despeared in 31(91.2%)patients in non-severe group, and 18(85.7%) patients in severe group (p=0.85). Both groups had a satisfied chest CT imaging recovery, which includes 22(64.7%) patients in non-severe group and 12(57.1%) patients in severe group recovered at least 50% of the whole leisions in the first week, and 28(82.4%) and 16(76.2%) recovered at least 75% in the second week, respectively.

The clinical utilisation of deep sequencing in HIV treatment has been hindered due to its unknown correlation with standard Sanger genotyping and the undetermined value of minority drug resistance mutation (DRM) detection.
Objectives
To compare deep sequencing performance to standard Sanger genotyping with clinical samples, in an effort to delineate the correlation between the results from the two methods and to find the optimal deep sequencing threshold for clinical utilisation.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective study using stored plasma collected from August 2014 to March 2018 for HIV genotyping with the commercial Sanger genotyping kit. Samples with available Sanger genotyping reports were further deep sequenced. Drug resistance was interpreted according to the Stanford HIV drug resistance database algorithm.
Results
At 15–25% minority detection thresholds, 9–15% cases had underestimated DRMs by Sanger sequencing. The concordance between the Sanger and deep sequencing reports was 68–82% in protease-reverse transcriptase region and 88–97% in integrase region at 5–25% thresholds. The undetected drug resistant minority variants by Sanger sequencing contributed to the lower negative predictive value of Sanger genotyping in cases harbouring DRMs.
Conclusions
Use of deep sequencing improved detection of antiretroviral resistance mutations especially in cases with virological failure or previous treatment interruption. Deep sequencing with 10–15% detection thresholds may be considered a suitable substitute for Sanger sequencing on antiretroviral DRM detection."

Results
Of ten patients, secondary, tertiary and quartus patients emerged; the incubation period was 3–7 days. Mainly initial symptoms were cough and low fever (37.3–38.0°C). An asymptomatic case presented normal radiography, the others had ground glass opacities. All cases (three transferred, seven discharged) were exposed to lopinavir on initial hospitalization. Three patients stopped lopinavir because of adverse effects, two of them deteriorated, one was hospitalized longer than others who with sustained lopinavir use. Levels of potassium, albumin, and lymphocytes were low, but increased persistently after treatment. Eosinophil values were low on initial hospitalization, then all returned to normal before discharge. Viral load of SARS-CoV-2, radiography and eosinophil improved continuously in 3–14, 6–8 and 7–9 days, respectively.

Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using 18 F-FDG in TB can localise disease sites and the extent of disease. 18F-FDG accumulates in the immune cells that participate in inflammation and granuloma formation, such as activated macrophages and lymphocytes. Therefore, FDG PET/CT scanning is now being evaluated for its usefulness in the diagnosis of extrapulmonary TB and in monitoring the response to treatment. FDG PET/CT imaging is positive and has high sensitivity in active TB, complementing conventional radiological imaging (X-ray, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging) in the diagnosis of primary pulmonary, extrapulmonary, and post-primary or miliary TB. FDG PET/CT has low specificity when it is used for solitary pulmonary nodule characterization, and its ability to differentiate TB from malignancy is limited in this setting. Dual point imaging has been proposed as a way to overcome this limitation. FDG PET/CT can reliably differentiate active from inactive disease, and there is promising evidence that it can contribute to the assessment of the response to treatment with an impact on patient management. FDG PET/CT has been found positive in cases of latent TB infection and its ability to identify activation early is currently being explored. More studies are needed to establish the utility of this method in recognizing multidrug-resistant TB cases. Furthermore, other PET radiotracers might prove useful in the functional imaging of TB infection in the future."

abstract = "Background
The aim of this study was to assess the validity of GeneXpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) and adenosine deaminase (ADA) in the diagnosis of tuberculous peritonitis (TBP).
Methods
The laboratory results of peritoneal effusion (PE) specimens from patients with symptoms suggestive of TBP, attending three TB specialized hospitals between January 2016 and December 2018, were included retrospectively. Clinically diagnosed TBP was set as the gold standard to evaluate the performance of these methods.
Results
In total, 191 individuals presenting with symptoms suggestive of TBP were included for analysis. The sensitivities of MGIT culture and Xpert were 17.2% and 18.3%, respectively. In addition, the TBP cases (69.8±6.0U/l) had higher amounts of ADA in their PE samples than the non-TBP cases (12.6±1.6U/l; p<0.01). Using a threshold of 31.5U/l to differentiate the TBP group from non-TBP group, the ADA assay provided a sensitivity of 89.6% and a specificity of 92.1%. The mean ADA concentration was significantly higher in bacteria-positive cases than in bacteria-negative cases (p<0.01).
Conclusions
In conclusion, the study data demonstrate the high sensitivity and specificity of the ADA test for the early diagnosis of TBP. In addition, the ADA concentration is directly correlated with the mycobacterial load."

Colistimethate sodium (colistin) is used to treat multidrug-resistant gram negative infections. We describe the profile and outcomes of patients given colistin in a tertiary level government hospital in Manila, Philippines.
Methods
We performed a retrospective study of adult patients given intravenous colistin between January 2015 to June 2018 in the Philippine General Hospital. We defined clinical success as a composite of hemodynamic stability, quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score, and microbiological cure.
Results
250 patients were included, half (49.2%) were admitted in the ICU. Median age was 55 years. There was an increase in qSOFA, APACHE II score, and septic shock from baseline to 24 h prior to colistin use. Most patients had pneumonia (90.8%) with extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii as the most common isolate (78.8%). Colistin was given in combination with meropenem (96.4%) for a median of 12 days. Nephrotoxicity was seen in 30.8%, with renal replacement therapy needed in 6%. Clinical success was seen in 61.2% of patients and overall mortality was 41.6%.
Conclusion
Colistin was frequently used in combination with a carbapenem for treatment of XDR-related respiratory infections. Nephrotoxicity was a common adverse effect. Clinical success was modest and overall mortality was high."

This review provides a brief discussion of the roles and associated mechanisms of lncRNAs in HIV infection. Moreover, due to the continued lack of effective HIV vaccines or treatments, we provide an insight into the complex interplay between lncRNAs and HIV and suggest innovative therapeutic strategies for HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

Methods
Children born between 2013 and 2015 were identified in the national population registry for retrospective observation. Vaccination history from the National Immunization Program registry and medical records from the National Health Insurance System were linked together to set up a cohort. VE based on original and propensity score matched cohorts were estimated and compared.
Results
A total of 990 224 children were included and 98% were vaccinated. The crude incidence of ACP, PP, and AOM for the original cohort was heavily skewed to the vaccinated group. Adjusting for age, sex, comorbidity, and healthcare utilization rate, the vaccine was found to be effective against PP (VE 60.15%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 21.21–79.85%) and AOM (VE 19.13%, 95% CI 13.42–24.46%). The propensity score matched cohort showed VE against ACP (5.95%, 95% CI 0.88–11.57%), PP (48.61%, 95% CI 23.60–65.43%), and AOM (33.21%, 95% CI 31.01–35.33%).
Conclusions
The direct effect of the PCV program was confirmed for ACP, PP, and AOM. The propensity score matched cohort is a feasible solution for measuring and tracing nationwide VE in countries with a very high level of vaccine coverage."

abstract = "Objectives
Piperacillin is a β-lactam antimicrobial frequently used in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury treated with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). However, data regarding piperacillin tissue concentrations in this patient population are limited. A prospective observational study was conducted of free piperacillin concentrations during a single 8-h dosing interval in plasma (8 samples) and subcutaneous tissue (SCT) (13 samples), in 10 patients treated with CRRT following piperacillin 4 g given every 8 h as intermittent administration over 3 min.
Methods
A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using NONMEM 7.4.3, to simulate alternative administration modes and dosing regimens. SCT concentrations were obtained using microdialysis. Piperacillin concentrations were compared to the clinical breakpoint minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16 mg/l), with evaluation of the following pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics targets: 50% fT > 1 × MIC, 100% fT > 1 × MIC, and 100% fT > 4 × MIC.
Results
SCT concentrations were generally lower than plasma concentrations. For the target of 50% free time (fT) > 1 × MIC and 100% fT > 1 × MIC, piperacillin 4 g every 8 h resulted in probability of target attainment (PTA) >90% in both plasma and SCT. PTA > 90% for the target of 100% fT > 4 × MIC was only achieved for continuous infusion.
Conclusions
Piperacillin 4 g every 8 h is likely to provide sufficient exposure in both plasma and SCT to treat P.aeruginosa infections in critically ill patients on CRRT, given that targets of 50% fT > 1 × MIC or 100% fT > 1 × MIC are adequate. However, if a more aggressive target of 100% fT > 4 × MIC is adopted, continuous infusion is needed."

Design or method
Blood samples from healthy volunteers (1,318) were processed by serology (by indirect IgG and capture IgM and IgG ELISA) and molecular tests to detect viral RNA and circulating serotypes.
Results
The seroprevalence of IgG for dengue were 85% in children and over 90% for adults. In addition to the high IgM positive rate (14.9%) and secondary recent infection marker rate (capture IgG, 16%), 8.4% of the healthy volunteers were positive for dengue virus (DENV) RNA.
Conclusion
This study confirmed the broad and permanent circulation of DENV in Colombia and the high rates of infection and reinfection suffered by its inhabitants. This information can be used by the health authorities to strengthen vector control and vaccine policies and review the algorithms of diagnosis and disease management in children and adults."

To describe the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children under five years in Tanzania.
Methods
Between January and December 2017, children aged 2–59 months with chest radiography-confirmed CAP were enrolled. The parents were interviewed to collect information on the patients and home-based medication. Clinical information was derived from the patient files. Nasopharyngeal swab and blood samples were collected for isolation of the causative pathogens. Swab samples were analysed by quantitative PCR whereas blood samples were tested using BacT/Alert 3D.
Results
Overall, 109 children with CAP were included in this analysis. Provision of care to most children was delayed (median = 4.6 days). A quarter (26.6%) were given unprescribed/leftover antibiotics at home. Only one child had positive bacterial culture. Referrals were associated with nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae (p = 0.003) and Haemophilus influenzae (p = 0.004). Of all admitted children, more than a quarter (n = 29) did not need to be hospitalised and inappropriately received injectable instead of oral antibiotics.
Conclusion
We found high rates of home treatment, particularly with antibiotics. Appropriate health care was delayed for most children because of home treatment. Efforts are needed at the community level to improve awareness of antimicrobial resistance."

We present an updated picture (1/1/2017–31/08/2019) of the frequency of carbapenemase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (CPKP) in surveillance rectal swabs (SRS) and in clinical samples (CS) of patients admitted to a tertiary level hospital, focusing on longitudinal evolution of CPKP detected in SRS and on colistin resistant strains.
Methods
Retrospective longitudinal analysis. Only the first positive CPKP strain isolated from each patient was included.
Results
638 CPKP strains were identified (471 in SRS and 167 in CS). SRS frequency increased over time in the medical department, remained high in the surgical department (SD) and decreased in the intensive care department. Most SRS–71.3%–and 49.1% of CS had nosocomial origin; about half of the SRS were identified in the SD. Regarding SRS evolution, carriage was confirmed in 39.5% of patients, no more testing in 25.5%, clinical involvement in 24.8 %, and negative result in 10.2%. Rates of colistin resistance were 20.1% in 2017, 31.2% in 2018 and 26.9% in 2019.
Conclusions
CPKP diffusion is still an important issue despite the surveillance program. It is vital to enhance medical staff’s awareness on this because most CPKP first detections in SRS occurred during hospital stay due to a nosocomial acquisition with a comparable picture over time. Colistin resistance is increasing."

World Health Organization estimates the annual global incidence of typhoid fever at 11-21 million cases and approximately 128 000 to 161 000 deaths. The currently used Vi-polysaccharides (Vi-PS) vaccines have been proven to be safe and efficacious in children 2 years and above. However, poor immunogenicity of Vi-PS was observed in children below 2 years of age. This Phase II study is the continuation of the previously published Phase I study that aims to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a novel Vi-DT Typhoid Conjugate Vaccine (Bio Farma) in subjects 6 to <24 months.
Methods
An interventional, blinded, comparative, randomized phase II study was conducted from July 2018 until January 2019. There were 200 healthy subjects divided into two groups: trial and control groups. Inactivated poliovirus vaccine was given to control group. Immediate and delayed local and systemic reactions up to 28 days post vaccination were recorded. Antibody titers were measured prior to vaccination (V1) and 28 days post vaccination (V2).
Result
The study showed that the seroconversion of Vi-DT vaccine 98.99%. One dose of Vi-DT vaccine induced higher geometric mean titers (GMT) in all subjects compared to that of baseline. Pain was the most common immediate and delayed local reaction. Immediate and delayed systemic reactions that mostly occurred was fever. There were no serious adverse events reported within 28 days post vaccination.

Methods
A total of 492 host community and 355 Syrian refugee subjects were recruited. Participant bio-information was collected using a study questionnaire. MRSA carriage was identified as recommended in the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. PCR was performed for typing the mecA gene and SCCmec groups.
Results
In the host community, 76/492 (15.4%) carried MRSA, whereas 49/355 (13.8%) Syrian refugees carried MRSA (p = 0.505). Refugees were classified according to their arrival date; 36/278 (13%) existing refugees and 13/77 (16.9%) new refugee arrivals were identified as MRSA carriers (p = 0.375).

The most common types of SCCmec in both communities were types IVa and V: 67.1% and 5.26%, and 49% and 2.04%, respectively.
Conclusions
It is inferred that the effect of MRSA in refugees on the host community will be negligible. However, the refugee carriage rate is higher than that found in Western countries, the final destination of refugees. Therefore, screening for MRSA is mandated and the rapid detection of carriers would prevent its spread."

Methods
HCV testing with a self-administered questionnaire was offered to 2822 individuals.
Results
There were 2079 patients screened. Overall, 397 (19%) of the total screened cohort were identified as having active HCV infections as measured by HCV RNA PCR. The patients were mostly male (84%), white (88%), and had a history of injecting drug use (IDU) (86%), homelessness (58%), and tattooing (42%). There were 136 new cases (7% of the total sample and 34% of identified active infections).

To analyse the immunogenicity and safety of inactivated subunit quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) versus trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) in children and adolescents 3–17 years of age.
Methods
In this phase III, multicentre, double-blind study, 1200 subjects were randomized to receive QIV (n=402), TIV with the B-strain of the Victoria lineage (n=404), or TIV with the B-strain of the Yamagata lineage (n=394). The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of QIV to TIV for immunogenicity against shared influenza strains, based on post-vaccination hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) titres. Secondary objectives were to show superiority of QIV to TIV for immunogenicity against alternate-lineage B-strains, and to further characterize the immune response by analysing virus neutralization and neuraminidase inhibition titres. Reactogenicity and safety were also compared post-vaccination.
Results
QIV elicited a non-inferior response for shared strains (upper limits of the 95% confidence intervals for the HI geometric mean ratios (GMRs) of TIV/QIV<1.5) and a superior response for alternate-lineage B-strains (HI GMRs of TIV/QIV<1.0; p<0.0001) versus TIV. Reporting rates of local and systemic adverse reactions were similar between vaccine arms.

abstract = "Background
Invasive fungal diseases (IFD) are a serious threat, but physicians in Asia lack access to many advanced diagnostics in mycology. It is likely that they face other impediments in the management of IFD. A gap analysis was performed to understand the challenges Asian physicians faced in medical mycology.
Methods
The Asia Fungal Working Group (AFWG) conducted a web-based survey on management practices for IFD among clinicians in China, India, Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand.
Findings
Among 292 respondents, 51.7% were infectious disease (ID) specialists. Only 37% of respondents had received formal training in medical mycology. They handled only around 2–4 proven cases of each fungal infection monthly, with invasive candidiasis the most common. For laboratory support, the majority had access to direct microscopy (96%) and histopathology (87%), but galactomannan and azole levels were available to 60% and 25% of respondents, respectively. The majority (84%) used clinical parameters for treatment response monitoring, and 77% followed the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. The majority (84%) did not use the services of an ID physician. Where febrile neutropenia was concerned, 74% of respondents used the empirical approach. Only 30% had an antifungal stewardship program in their hospital. Eighty percent could not use preferred antifungals because of cost.
Interpretation
The survey identified inadequacies in medical mycology training, non-culture diagnostics, access to antifungal drugs, and local guidelines as the major gaps in the management of IFDs in Asian countries. These gaps are targets for improvement."

abstract = "Background
Vancomycin is a common drug used in children with severe infection. In adults, at least 15 mg/L of the optimal vancomycin trough concentration (Ctrough) is needed to generate the target 24-h area under the concentration-time curve (AUC24) to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 400 for a pathogen with the MIC ≤1 mg/L.
Objectives
To determine vancomycin PK in children with severe infection and to explore the correlation between vancomycin Ctrough and AUC24 in children, as well as to propose the appropriate vancomycin dosages using Monte Carlo simulation.
Materials and methods
Children aged 2–18 years who were admitted to Chiang Mai University Hospital and received intravenous vancomycin for severe infection were included in the study. Serum samples for vancomycin PK were obtained before and serially after the administration of the first dose according to the protocol. Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed using Phoenix WinNonlin® 7.0 and NLME™7.0.
Results
Fourteen children with 64% males and age range from 2 to 13 years were included in this study. Non-compartmental analysis revealed the median volume of distribution, clearance, and elimination half-life of 0.58 L/kg, 2.82 mL/kg/min and 2.33 h, respectively. Vancomycin serum concentrations were best described by a two-compartmental model with first-order elimination.The observed Ctrough at 6 h correlated well with the AUC24. The median vancomycin Ctrough at steady state that correlated with the AUC24 ≥ 400 and <800 were 11.18, 9.50, 7.91 and 6.55 mg/L in simulated children receiving vancomycin 40, 60, 80 and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively.
Conclusion
Correlation between vancomycin Ctrough and AUC24 values in children has been observed. However, the values of Ctrough that correlate with the target AUC24≥400 in children are lower than the values observed and targeted in adults."

abstract = "Background
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) can cause renal and bone toxicity, which is associated with high plasma tenofovir concentrations in antiretroviral treatment of HIV-1 infected patients. Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is a novel tenofovir prodrug with a 90% reduction in plasma tenofovir concentrations. We aimed to assess the non-inferiority of a TAF-containing combination regimen versus a TDF-containing fixed-dose single-tablet regimen in the antiretroviral-treatment-naive, HIV-1-infected patients.
Methods
We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Trial Registry, from January 2001 to July 2019, using relevant keywords. Available data were extracted from eligible randomized trials (RCTs) and pooled as risk ratios (RRs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs) in a meta-analysis model using Stata/SE.
Results
We included seven eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 6269 participants. Patients who were antiretroviral-naive adults with HIV-1 on both the TAF-containing regimens and the TDF-containing regimens had similar virologic suppression effects (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00–1.04; p > 0.05) at week 24 (93.99% vs. 94.20%), week 48 (90.71% vs. 89.54%), and week 96 (86.16% vs. 84.80%). Both groups had no significant improvements in CD4 cell count for the naive patients during 48 weeks of therapy (SMD, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.16; p < 0.05). Both treatments were safe and well-tolerated, and most adverse events were similar as mild to moderate in severity. Moreover, compared with the TDF-containing regimens, the TAF-containing regimens in patients had significantly smaller reductions in both hip (RR, 0.33; 95CI, 0.29-0.39; p < 0.05) and spine (RR, 0.58; 95CI, 0.51–0.65; p < 0.05). Additionally, the TAF-containing regimens in patients had significantly fewer increases for renal events than those of the TDF-containing regimens through 48 weeks (0.31; 95% CI, 0.18–0.55; p < 0.05).
Conclusions
Our meta-analysis indicated that efficacy, safety, and tolerability of TAF-containing regimens were non-inferior in fixed-dose single-tablet regimens for initial treatment of HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, compared with those receiving the TDF-containing regimens, patients on the TAF-containing regimens had significant advantages in renal function, bone parameters, and lipid profile for the naive patients."

Nocardia bacteremia is a rare but severe disease associated with high mortality. This systematic review is the largest and most comprehensive review performed over the past 20 years.
Methods
A single-center retrospective review of Nocardia bacteremia was performed using hospital microbiology records from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2017. A systematic literature review was also performed to identify cases of Nocardia bacteremia described in the NCBI PubMed database in English between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2018.
Results
Four new cases of Nocardia bacteremia are described. The systematic review identified 134 cases with sufficient information available for analysis. Of the total 138 cases, the median age was 58 years (interquartile range (IQR) 44–69 years) and 70% were male. Eighty-one percent were immunocompromised (corticosteroid use (49%), hematological malignancy (20%), solid organ transplant (20%), solid organ malignancy (19%), and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (15%)) and 29% had endovascular devices. Pulmonary infection was the most common concurrent site of clinical disease (67%). The median incubation time to the detection of Nocardia bacteremia was 4 days (IQR 3–6 days). Blood cultures were the only positive microbiological specimen in 38% of cases. The median total duration of treatment was 75 days (IQR 25–182 days). Thirty-day all-cause mortality was 28% and overall all-cause mortality was 40%.
Conclusions
Nocardia bacteremia is most frequently identified in immunocompromised patients and those with intravascular devices. Although rare, it represents a serious infection with high associated overall mortality."

Yellow fever (YF) is a viral hemorrhagic disease caused by an arbovirus from the Flaviviridae family. Data on the clinical profile of severe YF in intensive care units (ICUs) are scarce. This study aimed to evaluate factors associated with YF mortality in patients admitted to a Brazilian ICU during the YF outbreaks of 2017 and 2018.
Methods
This was a longitudinal cohort case series study that included YF patients admitted to the ICU. Demographics, clinical and laboratory data were analyzed. Cox regression identified independent predictors of death risk.
Results
A total of 114 patients were studied. The median age was 48 years, and 92.1% were males. In univariate analysis, jaundice, leukopenia, bradycardia, prothrombin time, expressed as a ratio to the international normalized ratio-(PT-INR), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, lactate, arterial pH and bicarbonate, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) and Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 (SAPS 3) severity scores, transfusion of fresh frozen plasma, acute renal failure (Acute Kidney Injury Network stage III (AKIN III)), hemodialysis, cumulative fluid balance at 72 h of ICU, vasopressor use, seizures and grade IV encephalopathy were significantly associated with mortality. In multivariate analysis, factors independently associated with YF mortality were PT-INR, APACHE II, and grade IV hepatic encephalopathy.
Conclusions
In the large outbreak in Brazil, factors independently associated with death risk in YF were: PT-INR, APACHE II, and grade IV hepatic encephalopathy. Early identification of patients with YF mortality risk factors may be very useful. Once these patients with a poor prognosis have been identified, proper management should be promptly implemented."

Studies have shown improvement in the outcome of blood stream infections (BSI) due to the use of Rapid PCR-Based Blood Culture Identification Panel (BCID) in Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASP). There is currently no data on the use of BCID with ASP in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
Method
Pre-post quasiexperimental study included hospitalized patients with BSI, their positive blood cultures on BCID were studied in 2 groups: conventional culture with ASP (AS), and BCID with ASP (BCID). The primary outcomes were time to first appropriate antimicrobial therapy, infection related length of stay (LOS), ICU admission, 14 days bacteremia recurrence and in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were 30 days reinfection rate, hospital cost and ASP interventions.
Results
Out of total 477 positive blood cultures, 206 (AS and BCID) with real BSI were included. The time needed for organism identification was shorter in the BCID group than in the AS group (1.3 h vs. 51 h; P = 0.0002). BCID had a shorter time to appropriate antimicrobial therapy than AS (17.8 h vs.45 h; P = 0.0004). No statistical difference was observed in mortality rate, 14 days bacteremia recurrence, ICU admission, hospital cost, LOS or ASP interventions.
Conclusion
Implementing BCID to ASP significantly decreased the time needed to identify the organism and time to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Similarly, LOS and hospital cost were reduced, however, the reduction was not statistically significant."

For the 2013–2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, the largest Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic to date, we aim to analyse the patient mix in detail to characterise key sources of spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the case fatality ratios (CFR).
Methods
We applied a non-parametric Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) imputation approach for patients with missing survival outcomes and adjusted for model imperfection. Semivariogram analysis and kriging were used to investigate spatiotemporal heterogeneities.
Results
CFR estimates varied significantly between districts and over time over the course of the epidemic. BRT modelling accounted for most of the spatiotemporal variation and interactions in CFR, but moderate spatial autocorrelation remained for distances up to approximately 90 km. Combining district-level CFR estimates and kriged district-level residuals provided the best linear unbiased predicted map of CFR accounting for the both explained and unexplained spatial variation. Temporal autocorrelation was not observed in the district-level residuals from the BRT estimates.
Conclusions
This study provides new insight into the epidemiology of the 2013–2016 West African Ebola epidemic with a view of informing future public health contingency planning, resource allocation and impact assessment. The analytical framework developed in this analysis, coupled with key domain knowledge, could be deployed in real time to support the response to ongoing and future outbreaks."

Recent studies suggest that the clinical presentation of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is determined by the host immune responses to the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). The aim of the study was to characterize immune responses in TBE to give a better insight into the immunopathogenesis of this disease.
Methods
Anti-TBEV antibody levels, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood lymphoid populations, and concentrations of CXCL13 (a potent B-cell and T-cell chemoattractant), were analyzed in 35 patients with TBE (20 adults and 15 children).
Results
When compared with the blood, the CSF lymphoid population was significantly enriched in CD4+ T-cells and relatively depleted in natural killer (NK) cells and B lymphocytes. In comparison with TBE meningitis, patients suffering from TBE meningoencephalitis (n = 11, 31%) had a 3.5-fold higher median CSF CXCL13 concentration, 1.8-fold higher CSF/serum ratio of anti-TBEV IgG antibodies, and 1.8-fold higher median CSF cell count. CSF CXCL13 levels did not change significantly in children with TBE meningitis receiving supportive treatment, but decreased in children with TBE meningoencephalitis who received intravenous steroids.
Conclusions
CD4+ cells are abundant in the CSF of patients with TBE. CXCL13 may be involved in the neuropathology of TBE by attracting different subsets of lymphocytes to the CSF."

To obtain standardized epidemiological data for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in Slovakia.
Methods
Between October and December 2016, 36 hospitals in Slovakia used the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) surveillance protocol.
Results
The overall mean CDI incidence density was 2.8 (95% confidence interval 1.9–3.9) cases per 10 000 patient-days. Of 332 CDI cases, 273 (84.9%) were healthcare-associated, 45 (15.1%) were community-associated, and 14 (4.2%) were cases of recurrent CDI. A complicated course of CDI was reported in 14.8% of cases (n=51). CDI outcome data were available for 95.5% of cases (n=317). Of the 35 patients (11.1%) who died, 34 did so within 30 days after their CDI diagnosis. Of the 78 isolates obtained from 12 hospitals, 46 belonged to PCR ribotype 001 (59.0%; 11 hospitals) and 23 belonged to ribotype 176 (29.5%; six hospitals). A total of 73 isolates (93.6%) showed reduced susceptibility to moxifloxacin (ribotypes 001 and 176; p< 0.01). A reduced susceptibility to metronidazole was observed in 13 isolates that subsequently proved to be metronidazole-susceptible when, after thawing, they were retested using the agar dilution method. No reduced susceptibility to vancomycin was found.
Conclusions
These results show the emergence of C. difficile ribotypes 027 and 176 with a predominance of ribotype 001 in Slovakia in 2016. Given that an almost homogeneous reduced susceptibility to moxifloxacin was detected in C. difficile isolates, this stresses the importance of reducing fluoroquinolone prescriptions in Slovak healthcare settings."

In this retrospective analysis, we included patients with 99mTc-antigranulocyte SPECT/CT acquired in the context of a suspected bone and joint infection. All patients underwent routine diagnostics and/or had a clinical follow-up of at least 12months.
Results
26 episodes were included. Fifteen exams were performed for suspected osteomyelitis, and 11 for suspected orthopaedic implant-associated infection. SPECT/CT was ordered most often if standard diagnostic tests or conventional imaging modalities remained inconclusive. The overall sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of an infection were 77.8% and 94.1%, respectively. The positive predictive value was 87.5% and the negative predictive value 88.9%.

The re-emergence and spread of tropical viruses to new areas has raised a wave of concern worldwide. In order to treat patients at an early stage and prevent the diffusion of an outbreak, early diagnosis, and therefore fast and adequate detection, is needed. To this end, a multiplex reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction TaqMan method was designed to detect Zika (ZIKV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses simultaneously.
Methods
Two methods targeting different genome segments were selected from the literature for each virus. These were adapted for high genome coverage and combined in a four-plex assay that was thoroughly validated in-house. The SCREENED tool was used to evaluate the sequence coverage of the method.
Results
The full validation approach showed that the new four-plex method allows the specific and sensitive identification and discrimination of ZIKV and CHIKV in routine samples. The combination of two targets per virus allowing almost 100% coverage of about 500 genomes is shown for the first time.
Conclusions
PCR is a reliable user-friendly technique that can be applied in remote areas. Such multiplex methods enable early and efficient diagnosis, leading to rapid treatment and effective confinement in outbreak cases. They may also serve as an aid for surveillance, and the full validation permits easy method-transfer allowing worldwide harmonization."

abstract = "Background
Staphylococcus aureus is a serious pathogen, able to cause life-threatening infections such as bacteraemia. The association between S. aureus microbial characteristics and clinical outcomes is under-investigated in African settings. This study aimed to determine the molecular epidemiology and virulence characteristics of S. aureus isolates from bacteraemic patients at Tygerberg Hospital, South Africa, and to investigate the associations between pathogen characteristics and clinical outcomes.
Methods
This study included 199 S. aureus isolates collected from blood cultures between February 2015 and March 2017. Methicillin resistance was determined using disc diffusion and all resistant isolates were further characterized by staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing. Genotyping was done using spa and agr typing, and agr functionality was assessed using the phenotypic δ-haemolysin assay. Logistic regression models were performed to describe the associations between strain characteristics and the clinical outcomes methicillin resistance, in-hospital mortality, and length of stay (LOS).
Results
Of the 199 S. aureus isolates collected, 27% were MRSA, and the overall crude in-hospital mortality rate was 29%. Seventy-three different spa types were identified, including seven new types. Agr I was the most common type, in 99 (49.7%) isolates, followed by agr II, III, and IV in 57 (28.6%), 37 (18.6%), and six (3%) isolates, respectively. Agr dysfunctionality was observed in 25 (13%) isolates, mostly belonging to spa-clonal complex (CC) 012. Methicillin resistance was significantly associated with hospital-acquired infection (odds ratio (OR) 4.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.09–10.87). A significant increase in mortality was observed with increasing age (OR 7.48, 95% CI 2.82–19.8) and having a hospital-acquired infection (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.12–4.55). S. aureus strains with a functional agr system showed an association with longer duration of stay (OR 1.66, 95% CI 0.93–2.99).
Conclusions
We report the lowest MRSA prevalence at Tygerberg Hospital for the past 10 years, and agr dysfunctionality was shown to be driven by a certain genotype, spa-CC012. Despite the limited available clinical data, the study provided insights into associations between S. aureus epidemiology and agr-related virulence characteristics, and clinical outcomes."

The study aimed to analyze and update the impact of pertussis on the Italian population by evaluating pertussis-related hospital admissions in the period 2001–2014.
Design or methods
Hospital Discharge Records (HDR) were provided by the National Archive of HDR data of the Ministry of Health. Only hospitalizations included in the primary diagnosis were evaluated. Significant trends over the considered years were assessed as average annual percent changes (AAPC) applying the Joinpoint model.
Results
A total of 7,102 hospital admissions for pertussis (main diagnosis) were registered; the trend of hospitalizations progressively decreased from >1/100,000 inhabitants in the years 2001-2004 to 0.64/100,000 inhabitants in 2014. A great part of hospitalizations (63.6%) involved subjects <1 year of life; almost 20% of cases were registered in the age class 5-14 years. The Joinpoint analysis showed a statistically significant variation in some age classes.
Conclusions
Even if this study shows a decreasing trend in the number of pertussis-related hospitalizations, the impact of the disease in Italy in terms of hospital admissions continues to be relevant, especially in the <1 year age class. Pertussis therefore continues to be, in Italy as well as in other European countries, an important public health issue."

abstract = "Objective
South Africa has used antenatal HIV surveys for HIV surveillance in pregnant women since 1990. We assessed South Africa’s readiness to transition to programme data based antenatal HIV surveillance with respect to PMTCT uptake, accuracy of point-of-care rapid testing (RT) and selection bias with using programme data in the context of the 2017 antenatal HIV survey.
Methods
Between 1 October and 15 November 2017, the national survey was conducted in 1,595 public antenatal facilities selected using stratified multistage cluster sampling method. Results of point-of-care RT were obtained from medical records. Blood samples were taken from eligible pregnant women and tested for HIV using immunoassays (IA) in the laboratory. Descriptive statistics were used to report on: PMTCT uptake; agreement between HIV point-of-care RT and laboratory-based HIV-1 IA; and selection bias associated with using programme data for surveillance.
Results
PMTCT HIV testing uptake was high (99.8%). The positive percent agreement (PPA) between RT and IA was lower than the World Health Organization (WHO) benchmark (97.6%) at 96.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 95.9%–96.6%). The negative percent agreement was above the WHO benchmark (99.5%), at 99.7% (95% CI: 99.6%–99.7%) nationally. PPA markedly varied by province (92.9%–98.3%). Selection bias due to exclusion of participants with no RT results was within the recommended threshold at 0.3%.
Conclusion
For the three components assessed, South Africa was close to meeting the WHO standard for transitioning to routine RT data for antenatal HIV surveillance. The wide variations in PPA across provinces should be addressed."

In 2012, the World Health Organization recommended influenza vaccination for all pregnant women worldwide and the prioritisation of pregnant women in national influenza vaccination programmes. Nevertheless, vaccination rates in pregnant women often remain much lower than national targets.
Objectives
To assess the benefits and risks associated with influenza infection and vaccination during pregnancy, and to consider obstacles that work against influenza vaccine uptake during pregnancy.
Results
There is strong evidence that maternal and foetal outcomes can be compromised if women develop influenza infections during pregnancy. Influenza vaccines have been administered to millions of pregnant women and have demonstrated benefits in terms of disease prevention in mothers and their infants. There is a consensus amongst several recommending authorities that influenza vaccines may be safely administered during all stages of pregnancy. Healthcare professionals are recognised as the most important influencers of vaccine uptake, being well placed to recommend vaccination and directly address safety concerns.
Conclusions
Despite data supporting the value of influenza vaccination during pregnancy, vaccine uptake remains low globally. Low uptake appears to be largely due to ineffective communication with pregnant women about the risks and benefits of influenza vaccination. A graphical abstract is available online."

Statin intake may be linked with a lower risk of several infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, which is an important cause of mortality worldwide. The aim of this study was to investigate the definite impacts of statins on the risk of tuberculosis (TB) in diabetic patients and in the general population.
Methods
Four databases were thoroughly searched from inception up to July 2019. Articles in any language were included if they assessed and clarified statin intake, presented the risk of TB in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients or the general population, and reported odds ratios (ORs), relative risks (RRs), or hazard ratios (HRs) or contained data for relevant calculation. RRs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects models regardless of heterogeneity quantified by Cochran’s Q and I2 statistics.
Results
Six articles reporting observational studies involving 2 073 968 patients were included. Four reported cohort studies, one a nested case–control study, and one was an abstract. Statin use significantly reduced the risk of TB in DM patients by 22% (pooled RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.63–0.95), with severe heterogeneity (I2 = 76.1%). Statin intake also significantly decreased the risk of TB in the general population by 40% (pooled RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.50–0.71), with severe heterogeneity (I2 = 57.7%).
Conclusions
Statin use is related to a considerably lower risk of TB in both DM patients and the general population. However, these conclusions should be interpreted with caution given the possible remaining confounding, and call for large-size and multicenter randomized controlled studies in the future."

Methods
We designed a retrospective descriptive study using the minimum basic data set in patients admitted to hospitals of the National Health System between 1998 and 2015 with a diagnosis of Q fever (ICD-9: 083.0.).
Results
We found 4214 hospitalized patients with a mean age (±SD) of 50.9±19.3 years. The male/female ratio was 3:1. The incidence rate was between 0.41 and 0.65 cases per 100,000 person-years over the 18-year period. The highest incidence of cases was from March to August (p=0.024). 21.1% patients had pneumonia, 17.5% had liver disease, and only 3.2% had endocarditis. The average hospital stay was 13.8 days (±12.8). A total of 117 (2.8%) patients died. The total mean cost of QF is approximately €154,232,779 (€36,600±139,422 per patient).
Conclusions
QF is an important zoonosis in Spain with a stable incidence rate and high cost for hospitalization. Older patients have a more severe clinical picture and higher mortality, which can be decreased with early clinical suspicion."

abstract = "Background
The infection caused by Mayaro virus (MAYV), which presents as an acute febrile illness, is considered a neglected tropical disease. The virus is an endemic and emerging pathogen in South America and the Caribbean, responsible for occasional and poorly characterized outbreaks. Currently there is limited information about its expansion and risk areas.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was performed in 10 urban primary care health centers in the Cajamarca region of Peru from January to June 2017. A total of 359 patients with suspected febrile illness were assessed. RNA was extracted from serum samples, following which MAYV real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) for the detection of the nsP1 gene was performed.
Results
MAYV was detected in 11.1% (40/359) of samples after RT-PCR amplification and confirmatory DNA sequencing. Most infections were detected in the adult population aged 18–39 years (40%) and 40–59 years (32.5%). Headache was the most frequent symptom in patients with MAYV infection (77.5%), followed by fever (72.5%), myalgia (55.0%), and arthralgia (50.0%). During the study, most of the MAYV cases were seen in May (47.5%) and April (35.0%), corresponding to the dry season (months without rain).
Conclusions
This study is novel in describing the presence of MAYV in Cajamarca, an Andean region of Peru. Symptoms are non-specific and can be confused with those of other arbovirus or bacterial infections. Molecular biology methods such as RT-PCR allow the timely and accurate detection of MAYV and could thus be considered as a tool for surveillance in endemic areas."

The allele and genotype frequencies between patients with and without ATT-DILI were compared using three different genetic models.
Results
A total of 727/746 participants were successfully genotyped, and 112 of them were diagnosed with ATT-DILI. The A allele of rs8085707, G allele of rs76986960, and A allele of rs949037 conferred an increased risk of ATT-DILI, with estimated odd ratios (ORs) of 2.181 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.345–3.536, p=0.001), 1.983 (95% CI 1.060–3.709, p=0.029), and 1.390 (95% CI 1.032–1.873, p=0.03), respectively. Bonferroni correction indicated that the A allele of rs8085707 was a risk factor for ATT-DILI (Bonferroni correction: p=0.026).

We assessed the economic burden of AIDS-defining illnesses (ADIs), which was further stratified by adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART).
Methods and materials
A nationwide longitudinal cohort of 18,234 incident cases with HIV followed for 11years was utilized. Adherence to ART was measured by medication possession ratio (MPR). Generalized estimating equations modeling was used to estimate the cost impact of ADIs.
Results
Having opportunistic infections increased the annual cost by 9% (varicella-zoster virus infection) to 98% (cytomegalovirus disease), while the annual costs increased by 26% (Kaposi’s sarcoma) to 95% (non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma) in the year when AIDS-related cancer occurred. ADIs occurred more frequently in the years with low adherence for ART compared to the high-adherence years (e.g., 0.1≤MPR<0.8 vs. MPR≥0.8, event rate of cytomegalovirus disease 4.03% vs. 0.51%). The annual baseline costs in the years with MPR<0.1, 0.1≤MPR<0.8, and MPR≥0.8 were $250, $4,752, and $8,990 (in 2018 USD), respectively. The economic impact of ADIs in the years with low adherence (MPR<0.1) was larger than that in the high-adherence years (MPR≥0.8) (e.g., MPR<0.1 vs. MPR≥0.8, annual cost increased by 244% vs. 9% when candidiasis occurred).

Adherence to ART may increase the baseline medical costs but mitigate the incidence and economic burden of ADIs."

Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is the leading cause of neurologic disabilities and sensorineural hearing loss in children. However, in Taiwan, there is limited information on the genotypic diversity and prevalence of perinatal CMV infection in both mothers and neonates. The aim of this study was to screen samples from both mothers and umbilical cord blood for CMV at the time of delivery and to determine the CMV genotypic distribution.
Methods
Between June 2012 and July 2015, residual maternal and umbilical cord blood samples were collected from consenting participants admitted to the Chang Bing Show Chwan Memorial Hospital in central Taiwan. The blood samples were screened for CMV DNA using real-time PCR assay, and the genotypic classification of the CMV UL55, UL144, and US28 genes was determined by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.
Results
A total of 1282 mother-neonate paired samples were enrolled in the study, 95.3% of whom were Taiwanese. CMV DNA was detectable in 6.2% of the maternal blood samples, with a significantly higher rate noted in non-Taiwanese mothers (11.7%,p=0.027). For the 1,282 umbilical cord blood samples, CMV DNA was detectable in 5.3% of the samples. The presence of CMV DNA in maternal blood was positively associated with the presence of CMV DNA in umbilical cord blood (p=0.01). In addition, the UL55, UL144, and US28 genotypic distribution was similar between mothers and neonates.
Conclusion
The prevalence of CMV DNAemia in childbearing mothers and neonates is similar and their genotypic distribution implies potential CMV infection during pregnancy."

abstract = "Objectives
To investigate whether treatment supporters influence the completion of sputum smear monitoring (SSM) among adult persons with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis (BC-PTB), and to explore the reasons for incomplete SSM according to healthcare workers, persons with BC-PTB, and their treatment supporters in rural eastern Uganda.
Methods
A mixed-methods design was used. Quantitative data were abstracted from tuberculosis unit registers, while qualitative data were obtained through key informant interviews with healthcare workers and in-depth interviews with persons with BC-PTB and their treatment supporters. Quantitative data were analyzed with Stata. Qualitative data were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using a thematic content approach.
Results
Records were abstracted for 817 patients. Of these, 226 (27.7%) completed SSM. Factors independently associated with SSM completion included having a treatment supporter (adjusted risk ratio (ARR) 2.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23–4.70), treatment at a district hospital (ARR 1.61, 95% CI 1.04–2.49), treatment at a regional referral hospital (ARR 2.00, 95% CI 1.46–2.73), and every additional year since 2015 (ARR 1.29, 95% CI 1.17–1.43). Reasons for incomplete SSM related to health system, patient, treatment supporter, and healthcare provider factors.
Conclusions
Completion of SSM was low. Persons with BC-PTB who have a treatment supporter were more likely to complete SSM compared to those without, and those receiving treatment at higher level facilities were more likely to complete SSM compared to those at lower level ones."

The prevalence of active, chronic, and former hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections was investigated in a cohort of immunocompromised patients. The association with transfusion transmitted HEV was evaluated, and the HEV seroprevalence was compared with that in healthy blood donors.
Study design and methods
Serum samples from 4023 immunocompromised patients at Rigshospitalet, Denmark were retrospectively tested for HEV RNA and anti-HEV IgG. HEV RNA-positive patients were followed up by HEV testing, clinical symptoms, and transfusion history. Factors associated with anti-HEV were explored by multivariable logistic regression analysis. Samples from 1226 blood donors were retrospectively tested for anti-HEV IgG.
Results
HEV RNA was detected in six patients (0.15%) with no indications of chronic HEV infection. HEV RNA prevalence rates among recipients of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) and solid organ transplantation (SOT) were 0.58% and 0.21%, respectively. Transfusion transmitted infections were refuted, and transfusion history was not associated with anti-HEV positivity. The difference in HEV seroprevalence between patients (22.0%) and blood donors (10.9%) decreased when adjusting for age and sex (odds ratio 1.20, 95% confidence interval 0.97–1.48).
Conclusions
HEV viremia among allo-HSCT and SOT recipients suggests that clinicians should be aware of this diagnosis. The lack of association of blood transfusion with anti-HEV positivity supports food-borne transmission as the main transmission route of HEV common to both patients and blood donors."

Candidemia is a major cause of mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU). According to the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), an echinocandin is recommended as initial therapy and fluconazole as an alternative. In a context of echinocandin resistance development, the question arising is whether azoles are a suitable alternative to echinocandins for the treatment of candidemia in critically ill patients.
Methods
A 3-year (2015–2017) retrospective multicentric cohort study was conducted. Adult patients with a diagnosis of candidemia during the ICU stay and treated with echinocandins or azoles were included. Demographic, clinical data, mycological data, and antifungal treatments were collected. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, univariate analysis, and a multivariate logistic regression analysis using a propensity score with the inverse probability of treatment weighting method were performed.
Findings
Seventy-nine patients (n = 79) were analyzed. Treatment success, as well as survival on day 90 (Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, log rank test, p = 0.542), were comparable between patients who received echinocandins (caspofungin (n = 47)) or azoles (fluconazole (n = 29) or voriconazole (n = 3)). A multivariable analysis demonstrated that higher SOFA score on the day of candidemia diagnosis and absence of adequate Candida source control were independently associated with a greater risk of 90-day mortality, whereas azoles treatment was not associated with an excess 90-day mortality.
Interpretation
This study confirms that the use of azoles recommended for candidemia, mostly fluconazole, as a first-line therapy is a reasonable alternative to caspofungin for ICU patients in our institution. This needs to be included in local guidelines through antifungal stewardship programs."

Group A β-hemolytic Streptococcus (GAS), also known as Streptococcus pyogenes, is responsible for an annual 600 million cases of acute pharyngitis globally, with 92% of those infections occurring in low-resource settings. Further knowledge of the acute streptococcal pharyngitis burden in low-resource settings is essential if serious post-streptococcal complications – rheumatic fever (RF) and its long-term sequel rheumatic heart disease (RHD) – are to be prevented.
Methods
Two studies were conducted in school-aged children (5–16 years): a cross-sectional study of streptococcal pharyngeal carriage followed by a prospective cohort study of streptococcal sore throat over 4 weeks from March to April 2017.
Results
The cross-sectional study revealed an overall prevalence of GAS carriage of 15.9% (79/496, 95% confidence interval 12.8–19.5%). Among 532 children enrolled in the prospective cohort study, 358 (67%) reported 528 sore throats, with 221 (41.1%) experiencing at least one GAS-positive sore throat. The overall GAS-positive rate for sore throat was 41.8% (221/528).
Conclusions
The GAS pharyngeal carriage rates seen in Uganda (15.9%, 95% confidence interval 12.8–19.5%) are higher than the most recent pooled results globally, at 12% (range 6–28%). Additionally, pilot data suggest a substantially higher percentage of sore throat that was GAS-positive (41.8%) compared to pooled global rates when active recruitment is employed."

TDM using a targeted approach selecting patients with risk factors for suboptimal drug exposure (e.g. diabetes) or not responding to treatment for drugs with a clear concentration-response relationship may provide the best value for money. Semiquantitative point-of-care tests for detection of low or high drug concentration should be implemented at community level while quantitative assays can be performed at regional or central level.

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a deadly disease endemic in all countries around the Mediterranean Sea. In Palestine, VL is transmitted to humans from infected dogs by a sandfly bite. The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiology and spatiotemporal pattern of VL in Palestine within a period of 27 years (1990–2017).
Methods
A long-term descriptive epidemiological study on human VL was conducted based on patient's profiles to calculated disease prevalence, geographical, spatiotemporal and seasonal distribution, distribution by age and gender, diagnosis, treatment, and treatment outcome.
Results
A total of 343 patients were reported, the average annual incidence rate was 0.73 case/100000 population. Most cases came from the western parts of the West Bank. The number of reported males was 162 (51%), and patient’s age ranged from 4 months to 16 years (average 2.5 years), of which 93.3% were ≤5 years old. The annual incidence rate increased between 1993–1999, peaked in 1995, and dropped as from 2002. The future projections of VL indicate that the endemic foci in most governorates are projected to disappear in the future and only the very northwest of the West Bank will be at risk of VL.
Conclusions
Visceral leishmaniasis continues to be endemic in the West Bank but not the Gaza Strip. Pentavalent antimonial sodium stibogluconate continues to be the first line treatment and physicians are recommended to consider liposomal Amphotericin B (AmBisome) for refractory patients only. Geographical, spatiotemporal and seasonal trends of VL were identified."

To describe and analyse the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of imported human angiostrongyliasis in Europe.
Methods
A systematic literature review of cases of human angiostrongyliasis in Europe was performed. Seven databases were searched. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics were extracted from included records and simple summary statistics were performed on extracted data.
Results
Twenty-two cases reported between 1988 and 2019 were identified. They were mainly from French Polynesia, Southeast Asia, and the Caribbean Islands. The dominant suspected mode of transmission was ingestion of prawns, shrimp, or salad. For patients with data, 90% had a history of headache, often lasting, and half had paresthesia. Eighty-nine percent had eosinophilia, 93% had cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) eosinophilia, and 92% had elevated CSF protein. Central nervous system (CNS) imaging was normal in most cases. Two-thirds received albendazole or mebendazole treatment, although this is not currently recommended.
Conclusions
We have increased previous numbers to 22 reported cases in total since 1988. Angiostrongyliasis should generally be suspected in patients with a lasting headache who have returned from Southeast Asia, China, the Caribbean Islands, Australia, or French Polynesia, as well as parts of North America and Tenerife, Spain, although one autochthonous case from mainland Europe has also been reported. A dietary history should focus on prawns, shrimp, and salad, whilst also including slugs and snails and other paratenic hosts where relevant. The clinical diagnosis is supported by the presence of blood eosinophilia, CSF eosinophilia, and elevated CSF protein. A definitive laboratory diagnosis should be sought, and CNS imaging should be used to support, not to rule out the diagnosis. The most up-to-date evidence should always be consulted before initiating treatment. Current recommendations include analgesics, corticosteroids, and periodic removal of CSF for symptom relief, while antihelminthic treatment is debated."

The patient belongs to a nomadic population with a history of low YF vaccination uptake, in the Ifelodun Local Government Area (LGA) of Kwara State, Nigeria. An active case search in Ifelodun and its five contiguous LGAs led to the listing of 55 additional suspect cases of YF within the period of the outbreak investigation between September 18 to October 6, 2017. The median age of cases was 15 years, and 54.4% were males. Of these, blood samples were collected from 30 cases; nine tested positive in laboratories in Nigeria and six were confirmed positive for YF by the WHO reference laboratory in the region; Institut Pasteur, Dakar. A rapid YF vaccination coverage assessment was carried out, resulting in a coverage of 46% in the LGAs, with 25% of cases able to produce their vaccination cards. All stages of the yellow fever vector, Aedes mosquito were identified in the area, with high larval indices (House and Breteau) observed.

There are scant data regarding hepatitis C (HCV) virologic response to directly acting antiviral agents (DAAs) in chronic hepatitis B (HBV) and HCV coinfected persons. HCV treatment response in those with spontaneously cleared HBV infection is unknown.
Methods
All HCV infected persons treated with a DAA regimen in ERCHIVES were identified and categorized into HBV/HCV-coinfected (HBsAg, HBV DNA or both positive), HCV-monoinfected, and resolved HBV (isolated HBcAb+). SVR rates were determined and compared for all groups. Logistic regression model was used to determine factors associated with SVR.
Results
Among 115 HCV/HBV-coinfected, 38,570 HCV-monoinfected persons, and 13,096 persons with resolved HBV, 31.6% of HCV/HBV-coinfected, 24.6% of HCV-monoinfected and 26.4% with resolved HBV had cirrhosis at baseline. SVR was achieved in 90.4% of HCV/HBV-coinfected, 83.4% of HCV-monoinfected and 84.5% of those with resolved HBV infection (P = 0.04 HCV/HBV vs. HCV monoinfected). In a logistic regression model, those with HCV/HBV were more likely to achieve SVR compared with HCV monoinfected (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.17, 4.31). For HCV/HBV coinfected, the SVR rates dropped numerically with increasing severity of liver fibrosis (P-value non-significant). Factors associated with a lower likelihood of attaining SVR included cirrhosis at baseline (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.80, 0.92), diabetes (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87, 0.99) and higher pre-treatment HCV RNA (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.84, 0.87).
Conclusion
HBV/HCV-coinfected persons have higher overall SVR rates with newer DAA regimens. Though not statistically significant, the virologic response is graded, with decreasing SVR rates with increasing degree of liver fibrosis as determined by the FIB-4 scores."

Data are scarce regarding the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) among tuberculosis (TB) patients in Bangladesh. This study was undertaken to estimate the number needed to screen (NNS) to identify a case of DM among those with TB symptoms and those with confirmed TB disease, and to identify factors predicting treatment outcomes of TB patients with and without DM.
Methods
Persons attending public–private model screening centres in urban Dhaka for the evaluation of TB were offered free blood glucose testing in addition to computer-aided chest X-ray and sputum Xpert MTB/RIF.
Results
Among 7647 people evaluated for both TB and DM, the NNS was 35 (95% confidence interval (CI) 31–40) to diagnose one new case of DM; among those diagnosed with TB, the NNS was 21 (95% CI 17–29). Among those with diagnosed TB, patients with DM were more likely to have cavitation on chest X-ray compared to those without DM (31% vs 22%). Treatment failure (odds ratio (OR) 18.9, 95% CI 5.43–65.9) and death (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.11–3.90) were more common among TB patients with DM than among TB patients without DM. DM was the most important predictor of a poor treatment outcome in the classification analysis for TB patients aged 39 years and above.

We analyzed the spatial patterns of residence locations of smear or culture positive patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in Moscow. To identify clusters with high local incidence rates, the neighborhoods of detected cases were studied. We assessed the spatial and temporal stability of clusters.
Results
For 19033 cases diagnosed with smear or culture positive pulmonary tuberculosis among residents of Moscow in 2000–2015 we identified 18 small-scale clusters of increased incidence rate responsible for 3% of all registered cases identified on a territory inhabited by only 1% of the population. Locations of clusters were sufficiently stable in space throughout the whole period. The local incidence rate inside clusters was significantly (3–4 times) higher than the city average during the whole observation period. The presence of clusters was associated with the incidence rate in the surrounding area. Socio-demographic characteristics of patients in clusters were not significantly different from the average characteristics of patients in the city.
Conclusions
The detected small-scale clusters of increased incidence may be used to target active case finding for tuberculosis. The causes and mechanisms of cluster formation and stability need further study."

During dengue fever, a pronounced gamma-interferon immune response produces neopterin and promotes tryptophan degradation by the enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO-1). Activated IDO-1 is indicated by an increased kynurenine to tryptophan ratio (Kyn/Trp) in patients.
Methods
Plasma levels of neopterin, kynurenine, and tryptophan were measured in 72 hospitalized dengue virus (DENV) patients and 100 healthy individuals. Plasma levels of neopterin, kynurenine, and tryptophan were also measured prospectively in a second cohort of 13 DENV patients; on the day of hospitalization, on day 2–3 at discharge, and 7–10 days after discharge. DENV RNA positivity was determined by qualitative and quantitative methodologies.
Results
DENV RNA-positive patients presented significantly higher levels of neopterin (mean 36.5nmol/l) and Kyn/Trp ratios (mean 102μmol/mmol) compared to DENV RNA-negative individuals. A significant correlation between neopterin levels and Kyn/Trp ratios was observed in both DENV RNA-positive (Spearman’s rho=0.37, p< 0.01) and DENV RNA-negative (Spearman’s rho=0.89, p<0.001) patients. Kyn/Trp ratios were negatively correlated with platelet counts (Spearman’s rho=−0.43, p<0.01) and positively correlated with liver enzymes: AST (Spearman’s rho=0.68, p<0.01) and ALT (Spearman’s rho=0.51, p<0.05). In addition, the follow-up data presented a significant decrease in neopterin levels and Kyn/Trp ratios within 10 days after hospital entry.

Thirty-four patients were receiving systemic and/or inhaled corticosteroids prior to infection, eight had neoplasia, and six had haematological malignancies. Clinical and radiological findings were common to pneumonia of other infectious aetiologies, except for the frequent presence of nodules and cavitation. Overall, the 1-year mortality was high (38.2%), and mortality was directly related to the pulmonary disease in 15 patients (27.3%). The most frequently identified species were N. cyriacigeorgica (n=21), N. abscessus (n=8), and N. farcinica (n=5). All Nocardia isolates were susceptible to linezolid and all but two were susceptible to amikacin and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole.
Conclusions
Nocardia pneumonia-associated mortality remains high, probably because of the debilitated status of patients in whom this pathogen is able to cause pulmonary infection."

abstract = "Objectives
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) causes hospital- and community-acquired infections. It is not clear whether genetic characteristics of the bacteria contribute to disease pathogenesis in MRSA infection. We hypothesized that whole genome analysis of MRSA strains could reveal the key gene loci and/or the gene mutations that affect clinical manifestations of MRSA infection.
Methods
Whole genome sequences (WGS) of MRSA of 154 strains were analyzed with respect to clinical manifestations and data. Further, we evaluated the association between clinical manifestations in MRSA infection and genomic information.
Results
WGS revealed gene mutations that correlated with clinical manifestations of MRSA infection. Moreover, 12 mutations were selected as important mutations by Random Forest analysis. Cluster analysis revealed strains associated with a high frequency of bloodstream infection (BSI). Twenty seven out of 34 strains in this cluster caused BSI. These strains were all positive for collagen adhesion gene (cna) and have mutations in the locus, those were selected by Random Forest analysis. Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that these gene mutations were the predictor for the incidence of BSI. Interestingly, mutant CNA protein showed lower attachment ability to collagen, suggesting that the mutant protein might contribute to the dissemination of bacteria.
Conclusions
These findings suggest that the bacterial genotype affects the clinical characteristics of MRSA infection."

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of malaria in Sabah and its potential risk factors.
Methods
This cross-sectional study analysed secondary data obtained from the health clinics in Sabah, Malaysia from January to August 2016. The Pearson Chi-square test was used to analyse the relationships between malaria infection and socio-demographic characteristics. Multivariable logistic regression was performed in order to determine the risk factors for malaria in Sabah.
Results
Out of 1222 patients, 410 (33.6%) had a laboratory-confirmed malaria infection. Infection by Plasmodium knowlesi accounted for the majority of malaria reports in Sabah (n=340, 82.9%). Multivariable analysis indicated that males (prevalence odds ratio 0.023, 95% confidence interval 0.012-0.047) and those living in a rural area (prevalence odds ratio 0.004, 95% confidence interval 0.002-0.009) were at higher risk 24.0–95.9) and those living in a rural area (adjusted odds ratio 212.6, 95% confidence interval 105.8–427.2) were at higher risk of acquiring a malaria infection.
Conclusions
Malaria infections in Sabah, Malaysia are common, with P. knowlesi being the most common malaria parasite. The infection was associated with several socio-demographic and geographical factors. Thus, mitigation measures should be considered to address modifiable risk factors for malaria infection."

Current knowledge on infections caused by Scedosporium spp. and Lomentospora prolificans in children is scarce. We therefore aim to provide an overview of risk groups, clinical manifestation and treatment strategies of these infections.
Methods
Pediatric patients (age ≤18 years) with proven/probable Scedosporium spp. or L. prolificans infection were identified in PubMed and the FungiScope® registry. Data on diagnosis, treatment and outcome were collected.
Results
Fifty-five children (median age 9 years [IQR: 5–14]) with invasive Scedosporium spp. (n = 33) or L. prolificans (n = 22) infection were identified between 1990 and 2019. Malignancy, trauma and near drowning were the most common risk factors. Infections were frequently disseminated. Most patients received systemic antifungal therapy, mainly voriconazole and amphotericin B, plus surgical treatment. Overall, day 42 mortality was 31%, higher for L. prolificans (50%) compared to Scedosporium spp. (18%). L. prolificans infection was associated with a shorter median survival time compared to Scedosporium spp. (6 days [IQR: 3–28] versus 61 days [IQR: 16–148]). Treatment for malignancy and severe disseminated infection were associated with particularly poor outcome (HR 8.33 [95% CI 1.35–51.40] and HR 6.12 [95% CI 1.52–24.66], respectively). Voriconazole use at any time and surgery for antifungal treatment were associated with improved clinical outcome (HR 0.33 [95% CI 0.11–0.99] and HR 0.09 [95% CI 0.02–0.40], respectively).

The usefulness of serial procalcitonin (PCT) measurements for predicting the prognosis and treatment efficacy for hospitalised community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients was investigated.
Methods
This prospective, multicentre, cohort study enrolled consecutive CAP patients who were hospitalised at 10 hospitals in western Japan from September 2013 to September 2016. PCT and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured on admission (PCT D1 and CRP D1), within 48–72 h after admission (PCT D3 and CRP D3), and within 144–192 h after admission. CURB-65 and the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) were assessed on admission. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality; secondary outcomes were early and late treatment failure rates.
Results
A total of 710 patients were included. The 30-day mortality rate was 3.1%. On multivariate analysis, only PCT D3/D1 ratio >1 [odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 4.33 (1.46–12.82),P = 0.008] and PSI [odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 2.32 (1.07–5.03), P = 0.03] were significant prognostic factors. Regarding treatment efficacy, PCT D3/D1 >1 was a significant predictor of early treatment failure on multivariate analysis. PCT D3/D1 with the PSI significantly improved the prognostic accuracy over that of the PSI alone.
Conclusions
PCT should be measured consecutively, not only on admission, to predict the prognosis and treatment efficacy in CAP."

The Italian Society of Infectious and Tropical Diseases performed a survey on the application of guidelines for the management of persons living with HIV (PLWH), to evaluate current practice and the yield of screening for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in newly-diagnosed PLWH; in addition, the offer of preventive therapy to LTBI individuals and the completion rate were analysed.
Materials and methods
Newly-diagnosed PLWH in nine centres were evaluated retrospectively (2016/2017) using binary and multinomial logistic regression to identify factors associated with LTBI diagnostic screening and QuantiFERON (QFT) results.
Results
Of 801 patients evaluated, 774 were studied after excluding active TB. LTBI tests were performed in 65.5%. Prescription of an LTBI test was associated with being foreign-born (odds ratio (OR) 3.19, p < 0.001), older (for 10-year increments, OR 1.22, p = 0.034), and having a CD4 count <100 cells/mm3 vs ≥500 cells/mm3 (OR 2.30, p = 0.044). LTBI was diagnosed in 6.5% of 495 patients evaluated by QFT. Positive results were associated with being foreign-born (relative risk ratio (RRR) 30.82, p < 0.001), older (for 10-year increments, RRR 1.78, p = 0.003), and having a high CD4 count (for 100 cells/mm3 increments, RRR 1.26, p < 0.003). Sixteen LTBI individuals started TB preventive therapy and eight completed it.
Conclusions
LTBI screening is inconsistently performed in newly-diagnosed PLWH. Furthermore, TB preventive therapy is not offered to all LTBI individuals and compliance is poor."

abstract = "Objectives
Occult hepatitis B virus infection (OBI) carries a risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission and hepatocellular carcinoma. As previous studies have had a limited sample size, the characteristics of OBI with genotype B and C (OBIB and OBIC) mutations relating to hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) elicited by vaccination or a limited host immune response to HBV have not been fully explored.
Methods
In this study, the occurrence of OBIB or OBIC strains associated with envelope protein (pre-S/S) amino acid substitutions obtained from 99 blood donors stratified according to anti-HBs carriage were characterized extensively.
Results
According to the presence of anti-HBs within each genotype, the number and frequency of substitution sites specific for anti-HBs(−) OBIB were higher than those specific for anti-HBs(+) OBIB strains (67 vs 31; 117 vs 41), but the reverse pattern was found in OBIC strains (3 vs 24; 3 vs 26). Mutations pre-s1T68I and sQ129R/L were found uniquely in 15–25% of anti-HBs(+) OBIB carriers and mutation pre-s1A54E was found preferentially in anti-HBs(+) OBIC, while 17 substitutions were found preferentially in 11–38% of anti-HBs(−) OBIB strains. In the major hydrophilic region (MHR) region, mutations sS167 in OBIB, sT118 in OBIC, and sA166 in both genotypes were possibly immune-induced escape mutation sites.
Conclusions
Several mutations in pre-S/S of OBI appeared to be associated with carrier anti-HBs pressure, which might be risk factors for potential reactivation of viruses under anti-HBs selection in OBI carriers."

To improve the diagnostic efficacy of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) for Chinese patients with fever of unknown origin (FUO) and inflammation of unknown origin (IUO), with combined clinical parameters.
Materials and methods
FUO/IUO patients who underwent a standard diagnostic work-up and 18F-FDG PET/CT scanning were enrolled and divided into a local uptake lesion subgroup and a non-specific abnormal uptake subgroup. Beneficial clinical parameters for improving the diagnostic efficacy of PET/CT were identified.
Results
From January 2014 to January 2019, 253 FUO/IUO patients were studied. In total, 147 patients had local uptake lesions and 106 patients had non-specific abnormal uptake. In the local uptake lesion group, the positioning accuracy of PET/CT was 37.2% in grades 1 and 2, and 66.3% in grades 3 and 4. With the following combination of clinical parameters, the positioning accuracy increased to 75.0% and 90.0%, respectively: time from admission to performing PET/CT scanning <6.5 days and C-reactive protein level >95 mg/l. In the non-specific abnormal uptake group, the combination of sex (male), bicytopenia, and lactic dehydrogenase improved the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for diagnosing malignancy from 64.3%, 69%, 60%, and 72.7%, respectively, to 83.3%, 81%, 81.4%, and 82.9%, respectively.

A waste disposal crisis occurred in Lebanon leading to the accumulation of garbage in the streets of Beirut. It is not clear whether such a limited crisis of improper waste disposal will lead to more diarrhea illnesses. The purpose of this study is to compare the rates of admissions due to diarrhea and characterize the illness among adults and children before, during and after the garbage crisis.
Materials and methods
This study is an observational retrospective in-patient chart review extending over four time intervals: pre-crisis, major crisis, minor crisis, and post-crisis periods. Hospital admissions due to diarrhea or gastroenteritis were included. Descriptive analysis of the following was done: characteristics of the present illness at the time of admission, stool and lab tests ordered and management of the diarrhea illness.
Results
There was an increase in admission rates due to diarrhea in the months of the crisis as compared to pre and post-crisis months. The severity of diarrheal illness and the management of admitted patients were almost the same across the four periods. Rota virus diarrheal outbreak was noted during the major crisis among children less than 2 years old, and adults above 18 years old.
Conclusions
Despite an increase in the rates of admissions due to diarrhea during the garbage crisis, the severity of the diarrhea illness did not differ. This may indicate that physicians and patients were more worried and utilized more health services. However, Rota outbreaks may be more prominent with improper garbage disposal."

Results
Out of 1186 reports screened, 38 studies were finally included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. A higher risk of mortality was detected in patients with diabetes, heart disease, renal failure, and kidney disease, with risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of 0.72 (0.59–0.89), 0.39 (0.24–0.62), 0.41 (0.27–0.63), and 0.34 (95% CI 0.16–0.73), respectively. However, there was no association between mortality rates and comorbid hypertension, lung disease, liver disease, or malignant disease (p > 0.05). The highest mortality rates were due to sepsis (76%) and multiple organ failure (66%), followed by respiratory (19.4%), renal (18%), cardiovascular (15.7%), and hepatic (5%) mortality.
Conclusions
Modifications to the Fournier’s Gangrene Severity Index (FGSI) are recommended, in order to include comorbidities as an important prognostic tool for FG mortality.

Appropriate technology tests are needed for Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug-susceptibility testing (DST) in resource-constrained settings. This study was performed to evaluate the MDR/XDR-TB Colour Test (a colour platethin-layer agar test; TB-CX) for M. tuberculosis DST by directly testing sputum at University of Gondar Hospital.
Methods
Sputum samples were each divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was mixed with disinfectant and applied directly to the TB-CX quadrant petri-plate containing culture medium with and without isoniazid, rifampicin, or ciprofloxacin. Concurrently, the other aliquot was decontaminated with sodium hydroxide, centrifuged, and cultured on Lӧwenstein–Jensen medium; the stored M. tuberculosis isolates were then sub-cultured in BACTEC Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) 960 for reference DST.
Results
The TB-CX test yielded DST results for 94% (123/131) of positive samples. For paired DST results, the median number of days from sputum processing to DST was 12 for TB-CX versus 35 for LJ-MGIT (p<0.001). Compared with LJ-MGIT for isoniazid, rifampicin, and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, TB-CX had 59%, 96%, and 95% sensitivity; 96%, 94%, and 98% specificity; and 85%, 94%, and 98% agreement, respectively. All ciprofloxacin DST results were susceptible by both methods.
Conclusion
The TB-CX test was simple and rapid for M. tuberculosis DST. Discordant DST results may have resulted from sub-optimal storage and different isoniazid concentrations used in TB-CX versus the reference standard test."

abstract = "Background
The holistic management of tuberculosis (TB) patients can improve life expectancy and lost organ function.
Rehabilitation
Chronic sequelae are very common among patients who survive TB, which can lead to a further decline in lung function. There is still no guidance for ‘cured’ patients with impaired lung function who need pulmonary rehabilitation. Additional tests for evaluation should be given after the end of treatment, as recent studies have shown the good effect of pulmonary rehabilitation for TB patients.
Optimized nutritional care
Malnutrition is very common among TB patients and is related to malabsorption. The latter can cause lower drug exposure, which may result in treatment failure, increasing the risk of death, and can lead to acquired drug resistance. Malnutrition should be assessed according to the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria and the diagnosis should lead to an individualized treatment plan, including sufficient proteins and preferably in combination with adequate training.
Protective immune responses
Under normal circumstances, most immune cells use a glucose-based mechanism to generate energy. Therefore the patient’s nutritional status is a key factor in shaping immune responses. Disease-related malnutrition leads to proteolysis and lipolysis. In the end, the identification of individuals who will benefit from immune-modulatory strategies may lead to clinically relevant markers."

To investigate the genetic characteristics of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) circulating among children with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in Beijing, China.
Methods
Clinical samples were obtained from outpatients and hospitalized children with ARTIs between August 2010 and July 2016. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays were used to screen and identify hMPV, while partial glycoprotein gene sequences were used for phylogenetic analysis.
Results
Among the 10 918 samples, 292 (2.7%) were positive for hMPV. Overall, the virus was more prevalent among inpatients (4.3%) than outpatients (1.2%). A biennial alternating pattern of hMPV infection was observed, with infection rates fluctuating between 1.6% and 4.0%. Most cases were detected between December and April, showing clear-cut seasonality. Sub-genotypes A2b, B1, and B2 co-circulated in winter and spring in an alternating pattern, while only one A1-positive case was observed in 2012. The seasonal peak of hMPV was slightly delayed or overlapped with that of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus. hMPV activity increased in the 2010–2011 and 2014–2015 seasons, when influenza activity was apparently decreased compared with other epidemic seasons.
Conclusions
This study provides information on the epidemiological and genetic characteristics of hMPV in children in Beijing, and reinforces the significance of hMPV in children with ARTIs, especially lower respiratory tract infections."

Dengue outbreaks, mainly caused by dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2), occurred in 2007 and in 2010 in Gabon, Central Africa. However, information on DENV infections has been insufficient since 2010. The aim of this study was to investigate the current DENV infection scenario and the risk of repeated infections in Gabon.
Methods
During 2015–2017, serum samples were collected from enrolled febrile participants and were tested for DENV infection using RT-qPCR. DENV-positive samples were analyzed for a history of previous DENV infection(s) using ELISA. The complete DENV genome was sequenced to analyze the phylogeny of Gabonese DENV strains.
Results
DENV-3 was exclusively detected, with a high rate of anti-DENV IgG seropositivity among DENV-3-positive participants. DENV-3 showed higher infection rates in adults and the infection was seasonal with peaks in the rainy seasons. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Gabonese DENV-3 originated from West African strains and has been circulating continuously in Gabon since at least 2010, when the first DENV-3 case was reported.
Conclusions
These findings indicate stable DENV-3 circulation and the risk of repeated DENV infections in Gabon, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring to control DENV infections."

To quantify the costs of Chagas disease in Colombia from a societal perspective in 2017.
Methods
A cost-of-illness analysis was carried out using a prevalence-based approach. Costs attributable to Chagas were estimated from a bottom-up strategy, using population attributable fractions. Indirect costs were calculated using the human capital approach.
Results
The estimated total cost of diagnosed Chagas disease was US $13.1 million and included $5.7 million in direct medical costs, $1.5 million in direct nonmedical costs, and $5.8 million in indirect costs: absenteeism ($2.2 million), presenteeism ($3.1 million), and premature deaths ($515228). On average, people diagnosed with Chagas disease incurred $594 in medical expenses, and more than half of that expense was directly attributable to Chagas. The annual cost to society for a person with chronic Chagas disease was $4226.
Conclusions
Chagas disease imposes a substantial financial burden on healthcare system and society. Economic cost of illness-related productivity losses is much more significant. Our research suggests that a health policy framework addressing as many of the social determinants of health as possible may be pivotal in containing social costs. Therefore, reducing this burden is not only the responsibility of the health system."

Serum samples obtained from women living with HIV (n=552) and without HIV (n=552) were tested for rubella immunoglobulin G antibodies using an ELISA. The proportions of women with seronegative titres (<8IU/ml) and seropositive titres (≥11IU/ml), and geometric mean titres (GMT) were compared by age group and HIV status.
Results
The overall proportion of rubella seropositivity was 97.8%. The proportion of seropositive women increased with age group (18–25 years: 97.0%; 26–32 years: 97.7%; 33–40 years: 99.3%; p=0.047 after adjusting for HIV status). Similar proportions of women living with and without HIV were seropositive.
Conclusions
Rubella immunity was high among South African pregnant women living with and without HIV in the absence of rubella vaccination in the public immunization programme. However, a lower percentage of younger women had seropositive titres, indicating the need for routine rubella vaccination after an increase in vaccine coverage rates."

The double burden of diabetes mellitus (DM) and tuberculosis (TB) has attracted increasing attention, because DM not only increases the risk of active TB but also affects treatment outcomes. Screening for TB among diabetic patients has been recommended, but requires real-world evidence by considering its cost-effectiveness, cost–utility ratio, and cost–benefit ratio.
Methods
A screening program was conducted in Jiangyin City of Jiangsu Province, China. A total of 14 869 diabetic patients received regular physical examinations for three consecutive years and were followed for the diagnosis of TB. The cost of screening and the effectiveness, utility, and social benefits attributed to the program were evaluated. In addition, a matched case–control study was conducted and the nomogram was used to identify high-risk groups that could be the target population for screening.
Results
Among the 14 869 diabetic patients who participated in this screening program, 22 were diagnosed with TB, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 83 910 CNY per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) gained and a cost–benefit ratio of 0.50. If the screening program was limited to high-risk diabetic patients by considering body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose (FBG), and triglycerides, the ICER decreased to 34 303 CNY per DALY gained and the cost–benefit ratio increased to 1.22.
Conclusions
Screening for TB using regular chest X-ray examinations is feasible but not economical in areas with a low incidence of TB. It is recommended that diabetic patients with a low BMI, high FBG, and low triglycerides are selected as subjects for TB screening."

Pasteurella bacteraemia is rare, but has been associated with a high mortality rate. The aim of this study was to estimate the impact of comorbidities on patients with Pasteurella bacteraemia.
Methods
All cases of Pasteurella bacteraemia in adults treated in our centre between January 2008 and December 2017 were included retrospectively and compared with cases identified in a systematic review of the literature via MEDLINE covering the years 1951–2017. The epidemiological, bacteriological, and clinical data were collected, as well as the instances of death after 30 days.
Results
Twenty cases of Pasteurella bacteraemia identified in our centre and 99 cases from the literature review were included. A major comorbidity was found in 80/119 (67.2%) patients. The death rate at 30 days was 31.1%. The most common comorbidities were cirrhosis, immunosuppressive therapy, and malignant diseases. Age was not associated with mortality. On multivariate analysis, the only factor associated with mortality was a major comorbidity (odds ratio 2.78, 95% confidence interval 1.01–7.70; p = 0.04).
Conclusions
This study confirms the high mortality rate and highlights the importance of the host background, independent of age, in Pasteurella bacteraemia. Clinicians should be aware of the comorbidities in cases of Pasteurella infection, due to the poor prognosis of bacteraemia."

This study was performed to examine the current status of Zika and the effects of pre-existing dengue immunity on Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in Southern Taiwan.
Methods
A phylogenetic tree was used to analyze the phylogeny of detected ZIKVs. Paired sera from dengue patients were collected for the determination of dengue and Zika infection. Plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT) and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) were used to determine the titers of neutralizing antibodies and viruses, respectively. An antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) assay was used to evaluate the effect of anti-dengue antibodies on ZIKV infection.
Results
Epidemiological data indicated the continuous importation of ZIKV infection from neighboring Zika epidemic countries into Taiwan. A total of 78 dengue patients were enrolled and 21 paired serum samples were obtained. PRNT90 results for the 21 samples identified eight cases of primary dengue infection and 13 cases of secondary dengue infection; two samples were positive for ZIKV (MR766). Results from the ADE assay indicated that convalescent sera from primary and secondary dengue infection patients displayed significant ADE of the ZIKV infection when compared to healthy controls (p < 0.05).
Conclusions
This study suggests that pre-existing dengue immunity facilitates ZIKV infection and that the continuous importation of ZIKV infection may pose a threat to indigenous Zika emergence in Southern Taiwan."

To evaluate the clinical, laboratory, and immune characteristics of Zika virus (ZIKV)-associated encephalitis in pediatric patients after the epidemic in Huila, southern Colombia.
Methods
A pediatric neuro-surveillance hospital study was conducted in a referral health center in southern Colombia, from October 2016 to October 2017. Cases of encephalitis were confirmed by nucleic acid amplification tests and serological methods in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), plasma, and/or urine. Levels of six cytokines were evaluated by flow cytometry. Patients underwent daily clinical and laboratory follow-up.
Results
Twenty children with probable encephalitis were included for further studies and 16 of them were confirmed. Four cases of bacterial meningoencephalitis (Streptococcus pneumoniae, group B Streptococcus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli) and 12 cases of viral encephalitis were identified, six of them associated with ZIKV infection. Other viral encephalitis cases were caused by herpes viruses (n=3), enterovirus (n=2), and dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2; n=1) infections. ZIKV-associated encephalitis symptoms subsided faster than those of patients with encephalitis caused by other agents. CSF analysis revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis. Compared to healthy controls, children with ZIKV-associated encephalitis presented modest plasma interleukin (IL)-10 but not IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, interferon gamma (IFN-γ), or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Cytokine expression was differentially regulated, as dramatically elevated IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-γ levels were observed in CSF but not in paired plasma samples in one of the patients with ZIKV detectable in CSF.
Conclusions
This study provides evidence that ZIKV is responsible for pediatric encephalitis in endemic areas, and the local presence of the virus may induce cephalic but not systemic expression of cytokines."

Methods
Using Japan’s national administrative claims database, all outpatient visits with infectious disease diagnoses were linked to reimbursed oral antibiotic prescriptions. Prescription rates stratified by age, sex, prefecture, and antibiotic category were determined for each infectious disease diagnosis. The proportions of any antibiotic prescription to all infectious disease visits and the proportions of first-line antibiotic prescriptions to all antibiotic prescriptions were calculated for each infectious disease diagnosis.
Results
Of the 659 million infectious disease visits between April 2012 and March 2015, antibiotics were prescribed in 266 million visits (704 prescriptions per 1000 population per year). Third-generation cephalosporins, macrolides, and quinolones accounted for 85.9% of all antibiotic prescriptions. Fifty-six percent of antibiotic prescriptions were directed toward infections for which antibiotics are generally not indicated. The diagnoses with frequent antibiotic prescription were bronchitis (184 prescriptions per 1000 population per year), viral upper respiratory infections (166), pharyngitis (104), sinusitis (52), and gastrointestinal infection (41), for which 58.3%, 40.6%, 58.9%, 53.9%, and 26.1% of visits antibiotics were prescribed, respectively. First-line antibiotics were rarely prescribed for pharyngitis (8.8%) and sinusitis (9.8%). More antibiotics were prescribed for children aged 0–9 years, adult women, and patients living in western Japan.

We assessed the sensitivity on acute and paired convalescent sera from RT-PCR-confirmed CHIKV cases (collected at median one and 19 days post-onset of symptoms, respectively), and the specificity on sera of RT-PCR-confirmed DENV and ZIKV cases, and on negative patients.
Results
The Inbios and Euroimmun tests’ sensitivities for acute samples were 4.0% and 10.3%, while for convalescent samples they were 92.4% and 96.9%, respectively.

Conclusions
Both tests presented high sensitivity for convalescent samples. However, the Euroimmun test returned more equivocal results and presented a slightly lower specificity, which might result in a higher rate of false positives if the test is used in scenarios of low CHIKV transmission, when the chance of CHIKV infection is lower."

Chlamydia pneumoniae is a difficult to diagnose respiratory pathogen. This study was performed to systematically characterize humoral immune responses to selected C. pneumoniae antigens in order to provide novel serodiagnostic perspectives for clinical and epidemiological issues.
Methods
Based on a literature search, gene library screening, and serological proteome analysis, 15 immunogenic surface-associated, virulence-associated, and hypothetical C. pneumoniae antigens were selected, recombinantly expressed, and lined on a nitrocellulose strip. Specific IgM and IgG reactivity was measured in a total of 172 PCR- and micro-immunofluorescence testing (MIF)-characterized serum samples from patients with respiratory infections. A theoretical model was conceived to approximate a putative course of C. pneumoniae antigen expression and assess the potential of early and late antigens.
Results
While surface antigens performed poorly, the virulence-associated TARP was a reliable antigen for IgM detection, with a sensitivity of 80.0% and a diagnostic specificity of 90.2%. The hypothetical protein YwbM proved powerful for IgG detection with MIF-correlative sensitivities of up to 94.4% and a diagnostic specificity of 95.1%.
Conclusions
This study provides new insights into antibody profiles to immunogenic proteins in C. pneumoniae infection. The study findings offer antigen candidates for more reliable and standardized serological investigations of C. pneumoniae infections, including studies on seroprevalence and epidemiology."

abstract = "Objectives
The aim of this study was to characterize Neisseria meningitidis (Men) isolates in Tunisian paediatric patients with invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) in order to target therapeutic and preventive strategies.
Methods
Fifty-nine isolates of Men and four cerebrospinal fluid samples that were culture-negative but Men-positive by PCR (NC-MenPPCR) (2009–2016) were collected from IMD patients. Isolates were analysed for their antimicrobial susceptibility. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was used to characterize isolates and multilocus sequence typing for NC-MenPPCR. Coverage of Men serogroup B (MenB) was determined by Genetic Meningococcal Antigen Typing System (gMATS) and fHbp expression by ELISA.
Results
MenB was the predominant type (88.9%). The majority of isolates (81%) had reduced susceptibility to penicillin G with altered penA alleles. The clonal complex CC461 (27.1%) was the most frequent. Among the MenB vaccine targets neisserial heparin binding antigen (NHBA) and fHbp, the predominant variants were NHBA118 (30.8%) and fHbp peptide 47 (25%), respectively. The nadA gene was present in 17.3% of isolates. Using gMATS, 36.5% of MenB were predicted to be covered by the 4CMenB vaccine. ELISA showed that 92.4% of the MenB were expected to be killed by anti-fHbp antibodies.
Conclusions
MenB was the leading serogroup in IMD, and more than 90% had a sufficient level of fHbp expression for vaccine coverage. The study results will be useful for the Tunisian vaccination programme."

To describe colistin-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii isolates in Cape Town, South Africa.
Methods
A. baumannii isolates identified on Vitek 2 Advanced Expert System were collected from Tygerberg Hospital referral laboratory between 2016 and 2017. Colistin resistance was confirmed using broth microdilution and SensiTest. mcr-1–5 were detected using PCR and strain typing was performed by rep-PCR. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on a subset of isolates to identify chromosomal colistin resistance mechanisms and strain diversity using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pairwise single nucleotide polymorphism analyses.
Results
Twenty-six colistin-resistant and six colistin-susceptible A. baumannii were collected separately based on Vitek susceptibility; 20/26 (77%) were confirmed colistin-resistant by broth microdilution. Four colistin-resistant isolates were isolated in 2016 and 16 in 2017, from five healthcare facilities. Thirteen colistin-resistant isolates and eight colistin-susceptible isolates were identical by rep-PCR and MLST (ST1), all from patients admitted to a tertiary hospital during 2017. The remaining colistin-resistant isolates were unrelated.
Conclusions
An increase in colistin-resistant A. baumannii isolates from a tertiary hospital in 2017 appears to be clonal expansion of an emerging colistin-resistant strain. This strain was not detected in 2016 or from other hospitals. Identical colistin-susceptible isolates were also isolated, suggesting relatively recent acquisition of colistin resistance."

Egypt ranks first regarding the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Many patients have concomitant diseases like kidney disorders requiring hemodialysis, a procedure carrying the hazard of transmitting other hepatitis viruses. The purpose of this study was to investigate for occult hepatitis B virus (HBV), SEN virus (SENV), and torque teno virus (TTV) among chronic HCV patients on maintenance hemodialysis to identify their impacts.
Methods
A total of 325 hemodialysis patients were enrolled and divided into two groups based on HCV RNA testing results. Blood samples were collected before hemodialysis. Sera were tested for hepatitis B core antibodies (anti-HBc) and hepatitis B surface antibodies (anti-HBs) using ELISA. HBV, SENV, and TTV DNA were detected by PCR. The serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was measured.
Results
Anti-HBc and HBV DNA were detected in 73.1% and 50.8% of group 1 versus 36.4% and 22.6% of group 2. The serum ALT level was higher in group 1 than group 2. SENV was detected in 11.5% of group 1 versus 8.2% of group 2. TTV was detected in 29% of group 1 versus 27% of group 2.
Conclusions
There is an increased prevalence of occult HBV in our locality among chronic HCV patients undergoing hemodialysis. The existence of SENV and TTV viremia has no clinical impact."

abstract = "Objectives
Men who have sex with men (MSM) represent one of the major risk groups for HIV-1 infection in China, and the predominant subtypes among this population has changed over the last two decades. The objective of this study was to determine the evolutionary characteristics and transmission patterns of the dominant HIV-1 strains in the Chinese MSM population.
Methods
A total of 4980 published HIV-1 pol gene sequences from MSM in China were retrieved and comprehensive evolutionary and transmission analyses were then conducted. Bayesian coalescent-based methods and selection pressure analyses were used to reconstruct the time-scale and demographic history and to estimate other evolutionary parameters. Transmission patterns were characterized using network analyses.
Results
There were 2546 (51.12%) CRF01_AE, 1263 (25.36%) CRF07_BC, and 623 (12.51%) subtype B, accounting for 88.99% of the total sequences. From 2000 to 2016, the prevalence of CRF01_AE was stable, comprising nearly half of all sequences over time (58.33–45.38%, p=0.071). CRF07_BC increased slightly from 13.3% to 22.49% (p<0.001), while subtype B decreased dramatically from 41.67% to 9.04% (p<0.001). Demographic reconstruction showed that the greatest expansion of the HIV epidemic occurred between 1999 and 2005. CRF01_AE had a higher estimated evolutionary rate (2.97×10−3 substitutions/site/year) and exhibited more sites under positive selection (25/351 codons) compared to the other subtypes. Network analyses showed that CRF07_BC (68.29%, 84/123) had a higher proportion of cross-region networks than CRF01_AE (49.1%, 174/354) and subtype B (36.46%, 35/96) (p<0.001).
Conclusions
The predominant subtypes of HIV-1 in Chinese MSM have different evolutionary characteristics and transmission patterns, which poses a significant challenge to HIV treatment and disease prevention."

To assess the immune effect of different types of hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) booster doses 2–32 years after primary immunization, explore the influencing factors, and offer guidance regarding the necessity and timing of boosters.
Methods
In total, 1163 participants who were born from 1986 to 2015, received the HepB full-course primary vaccination, were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) negative, and had hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) <10 mIU/mL were enrolled. Individuals were randomly divided into two groups and received a booster dose of HepB. Venous blood samples were collected 30 days later and tested for anti-HBs.
Results
In total, 595 and 568 individuals received a single dose of HepB (CHO) and HepB (SC), respectively. Venous blood samples were obtained from 1079 vaccinees (CHO: 554, SC: 525). The seroconversion rates were 93.68% (519/554) and 86.67% (455/525) (p < 0.05), with geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) of 426.58 mIU/ml and 223.8 mIU/ml, respectively. This result indicated that BMI, smoking status, vaccine types of booster and prebooster anti-HBs concentration significantly influenced anti-HBs levels. Only BMI, prebooster anti-HBs concentrations and booster types were different between the anti-HBs positive and negative groups.
Conclusions
Participants boostered with HepB (CHO) had a relatively higher seroconversion rate than those boostered with HepB (SC). The high seroconversion rates in the two groups suggested that the subjects remained protected despite low circulating antibodies, so there is currently no urgent need for booster immunization. Factors including BMI ≥ 25 and prebooster anti-HBs concentration <2.5 mIU/mL, which contributed to lower responses to a booster dose, might indicate a greater risk of breakthrough infection."

abstract = "Background
Strongyloidiasis is a devastating disease with a mortality rate exceeding 50% in immunocompromised patients. The disease usually results from reactivation of a latent infection in a transplant patient. Alternatively, donor-derived transmission of Strongyloides may occur.
Methods
In this review, we report a case of Strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome in a liver transplant recipient to illustrate the severity of this infection. Following this, PubMed was searched for cases of transplant-related strongyloidiasis in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Demographic data, the clinical presentation of recipients, and donor information were recorded. Methods of diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical outcomes were documented.
Results
A total of 12 transplant-related strongyloidiasis cases were identified. Seventy-five percent of the patients were from Saudi Arabia. Three cases from Kuwait shared common donors. All donors were deceased and native to an area endemic for Strongyloides. Five of the patients shared common donors, raising the possibility of donor-derived infection. Neither the donors nor the recipients underwent screening tests for Strongyloides. Concomitant bacteremia and/or meningitis was seen in 50% of cases (6/12). Moreover, when documented, sepsis was detected in all of the patients who died (three cases). The mortality rate in this series was high (41.7%).
Conclusions
Since this is a preventable condition, early diagnosis and treatment is essential. The screening and treatment of potential transplant recipients and donors proved to be an effective preventive measure. There is a growing need for further studies and implementation of screening policies in the GCC countries to prevent this fatal infection."

Epidemiological evidence links onchocerciasis with the development of epilepsy. The aim of this study was to detect Onchocerca volvulus microfilariae or its bacterial endosymbiont, Wolbachia, in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of persons with onchocerciasis-associated epilepsy (OAE).
Methods
Thirteen persons with OAE and O. volvulus skin snip densities of >80 microfilariae were recruited in Maridi County (South Sudan) and their CSF obtained. Cytospin centrifuged preparations of CSF were examined by light microscopy for the presence of O. volvulus microfilariae. DNA was extracted from CSF to detect O. volvulus (O–150 repeat) by quantitative real-time PCR, and Wolbachia (FtsZ gene) by standard PCR. To further investigate whether CSF from onchocerciasis-infected participants could induce seizures, 3- and 7-day old zebrafish larvae were injected with the CSF intracardially and intraperitoneally, respectively. For other zebrafish larvae, CSF was added directly to the larval medium.
Results
No microfilariae, parasite DNA, or Wolbachia DNA were detected in any of the CSF samples by light microscopy or PCR. All zebrafish survived the procedures and none developed seizures.
Conclusions
The absence of O. volvulus in the CSF suggests that OAE is likely not caused by direct parasite invasion into the central nervous system, but by another phenomenon triggered by O. volvulus infection."

Many studies have reported methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) transmission from patients infected or colonized with MRSA to their household contacts, but the importance of household transmission for persistence of MRSA in the community and reintroduction into healthcare settings is not well understood.
Methods
This review was performed to evaluate evidence on (1) MRSA prevalence, (2) MRSA contact positivity, and (3) MRSA carriage duration in household contacts of MRSA-positive individuals. The MEDLINE and Embase databases were searched covering the period from January 1, 1960 to November 15, 2019 for studies with data on these outcomes. A random-effects model meta-analysis was conducted with included studies to calculate pooled prevalence ratios.
Results
A total 22 relevant articles were included. The meta-analysis showed that the pooled prevalence of MRSA among culture-positive MRSA household contacts was 25.0% (95% confidence interval 20.0–30.0%). A subset of studies with adequate comparison groups reported higher colonization prevalence among household contacts of MRSA-positive individuals compared with household contacts of MRSA-negative individuals. MRSA contact positivity varied between 19.0% and 33.0%, but variation in sampling frequency and follow-up duration made between-study comparisons challenging.
Conclusions
Substantial MRSA transmission occurs in household settings. Improved understanding of household transmission dynamics and the relationship between transmission in healthcare and household settings will be critical to inform improved strategies to control MRSA."

To determine the molecular characteristics of a sequence type 338 community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) strain and the relationship among MRSA strains from various lineages and areas.
Methods
Whole-genome sequencing, genomic comparison, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and hemolysis analysis were performed to identify the resistance determinants and virulence factors of strain ZY05 and the relationships among CC59 clones.
Results
MRSA strain ZY05 was resistant to tetracycline, erythromycin, and clindamycin, and the resistance genes erm(B) and tet(K) were detected in the genome. ZY05 harbors the genomic islands νSaα, νSaβ, νSaγ, and ΦSa2, the pathogenicity island νSa1, and virulence factors such as Panton–Valentine leukocidin, phenol-soluble modulins, alpha-hemolysin, enterotoxin B, enterotoxin K, and enterotoxin Q, which are the same as those present in ST59 strains. In addition, the virulence potential of ST338 did not differ from that of ST59. This strain contains the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type VT, a distinct SCCmec type previously reported from Taiwan. The results of core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) analysis showed that the gene distances between ST59 and ST338 were close among CC59 isolates, while strains from Taiwan were identical to isolates from the Chinese mainland with respect to these two sequence types.
Conclusions
The ST338 strain ZY05, which has a close genetic relationship to ST59 strains, is multidrug-resistant and highly virulent. Strains of two identical lineages, ST59 and ST338, from Taiwan and the Chinese mainland may have the same genetic background."

Previous studies in the Central African Republic (CAR) have reported the presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) recombinant genotype E/D and a suspicion of immune escape mutants (IEMs), without further investigation into their impact on prevention and diagnosis. Consequently, this study investigated HBV mutations among hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive patients attending Institut Pasteur de Bangui in the CAR.
Methods
Sera from a total of 118 HBsAg-positive patients with no previous history of HBV treatment or vaccination at the Institut Pasteur de Bangui, were sampled between 2017 and 2019. Subsequently, the region spanning the surface and polymerase genes of HBV was amplified by PCR and sequenced. HBV sequences were genotyped/subgenotyped by phylogenetic analysis and serotyped based on predicted amino acid residues at positions s122, s127, s140, s159, and s160. They were then analyzed for HBV IEMs and polymerase mutations.
Results
The region spanning the surface and polymerase genes was successfully amplified and sequenced for 51 samples. Of the HBV sequences, 49 were genotype E and two were genotype A subgenotype A1; these were serotyped as ayw4 and ayw1, respectively. Potential IEMs sY100C, sA128V, and sM133T, and several polymerase mutants were identified.

A total of 693 patients were included, and a weight gain was noted after the switch at weeks 12 (mean +0.63 kg), 24 (+1.25), 36 (+1.58), and 48 (+1.75) (all p < 0.0001). The weight change after the switch was significantly greater than that observed within the preceding 48-week period before the switch (+1.75 kg vs +0.54, p < 0.0001) and was correlated with switch to E/C/F/TAF (coefficient 0.29), later clinic visit (0.15), baseline weight (0.99), diabetes mellitus (coefficient −0.96), and age (−0.02) (all p < 0.01). At week 48, significant increases were observed for TG (mean +62.93 mg/dl), TC (+22.30), LDL-C (+9.70), HDL-C (+3.65) (all p < 0.01), and HbA1c (+0.08%) (p < 0.05), but not TC/HDL-C ratio (+0.12, p = 0.38).
Conclusions
Virally suppressed HIV-positive patients gained a moderate amount of weight and had significant increases in lipid levels after switching to E/C/F/TAF."

abstract = "Background
Patients with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) are usually placed in respiratory isolation awaiting three sputum smear microscopy results for acid-fast bacilli (3AFB). GeneXpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) on a pooled sample from two sputa may allow for more rapid de-isolation.
Objectives
To compare the sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of Xpert performed on a single pooled sputum sample (‘pooled Xpert’) to 3AFB, in order to exclude PTB in patients placed in respiratory isolation.
Methods
Hospital inpatients in respiratory isolation for possible PTB were enrolled prospectively. Three expectorated sputum samples were obtained for smear microscopy. Two of the same samples had 0.5 ml removed from each and pooled for pooled Xpert. The diagnostic accuracy of pooled Xpert and 3AFB were assessed and compared to liquid culture at 8 weeks as the reference standard.
Results
Of 56 participants, nine (16.1%) were diagnosed with PTB. Compared to liquid culture, pooled Xpert had a sensitivity of 88.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 57–99%) and NPV of 97.9% (95% CI 89–99%). 3AFB had a sensitivity of 66.7% (95% CI 35–88%) and NPV of 93.5% (95% CI 83–98%).
Conclusions
A single pooled Xpert was non-inferior to 3AFB, with a strong trend towards greater sensitivity and better NPV. These findings support the use of a single pooled Xpert as an effective rapid screening approach for ruling out PTB in low incidence settings. Its value in high incidence settings and optimal combination with smear microscopy and culture warrant further evaluation."

The goal of this work was to assess the genetic diversity of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates in Russia and Europe and to compare the distribution of the N. gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequencing types (NG-MAST) of Russian isolates with that of isolates from European countries.
Methods
NG-MAST typing was performed for 804 N. gonorrhoeae isolates collected in Russia in 2013–2018. For isolates from European countries, data from the https://pathogen.watch/collection/eurogasp2013 database were used.
Results
Among the isolates from Russia, 296 NG-MAST types were found. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed seven major genogroups uniting the most frequent Russian sequence types: G807, G1993, G9476, G14942, G1152, G9486, and G12531.
Conclusions
The NG-MAST type distribution in Russia differed from that in European countries. Most of the Russian isolates had sequence types that were not found in Europe. Only 33% of the Russian isolates belonged to genogroups established for European countries, and the widespread European genogroup G1407 was represented by only nine isolates. Analysis of the Russian isolates belonging to phylogenetically close European genogroups indicated similarities in drug resistance, although no epidemically dangerous drug-resistant clones were found among the Russian isolates."

In developing countries, Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection is mostly asymptomatic in early childhood. EBV persistence may lead to different malignancies, such as B cell derived lymphomas. In Argentina, most children are seropositive at three years and an increased association between EBV and lymphoma was proved in children under 10 years old by our group.
Objective
Our aim was to characterize EBV infection at the site of entry and reactivation of viral infection —the tonsils— in order to better understand the mechanism of viral persistence in pediatric patients.
Methods
A cohort of 54 patients was described. We assessed specific antibodies profiles in sera; viral proteins presence by IHC on FFPE samples and EBV type from fresh tissue.
Results
EBV type 1 was prevalent, mostly in the youngest patients. Asymptomatic primary infected patients presented higher viral loads and Latency 0/I or II patterns, whereas the Latency III pattern was observed mostly in healthy carriers. There were no differences between groups in the expression of viral lytic antigens. This study discloses new features in patients undergoing primary infection from a developing population. Low viral inoculum and restricted viral antigen expression may be responsible for the lack of symptoms in children from our country."

To compare the prevalence of levofloxacin (LFX) resistance and the population structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) with different mutations conferring LFX resistance between 2005 and 2015.
Methods
A total 542 MTB isolates were randomly selected from pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients in 2005 and 2015 and analyzed regarding minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDR).
Results
One hundred and eleven of the 542 MTB isolates analyzed (20.5%) were resistant to LFX. There were 42 and 69 LFX-resistant isolates from 2005 and 2015, respectively, and MIC high-level LFX resistance was significantly higher in 2015 (40.6%, 28/69) than in 2005 (16.7%, 7/42) (p = 0.02). There were 87 (78.4%) mutations of these 111 LFX-resistant isolates. In addition, a significant difference in proportion was observed in the isolates with mutations in codon 90 of the gyrA gene between 2005 and 2015 (11.9% in 2005 versus 29.0% in 2015, p = 0.04).
Conclusions
There was an alarming increase in prevalence of LFX-resistant TB in China between 2005 and 2015. This dynamic change is mostly attributed to the increase in high-level LFX resistance. Moreover, a significant difference was noted in the proportion of LFX-resistant isolates harboring specific mutations within the gyrA gene between 2005 and 2015."

Tuberculosis (TB) treatment takes a long time, and a gold standard test to define TB cure is lacking. This may lead to early discharge of TB patients, resulting in an increased risk of disease transmission and drug resistance. Plasma lncRNAs might act as potential biomarkers to evaluate TB cure in an efficient and precise manner.
Methods
A lncRNA microarray assay was used to screen differentially expressed plasma lncRNAs in untreated TB and cured TB subjects. The expression levels of lncRNAs were verified by qPCR. Target genes of lncRNAs were predicted using a coding–non-coding gene co-expression network and mRNA–lncRNA–miRNA interaction network analysis.
Results
The expression levels of lncRNAs uc.48+ (p < 0.001) and NR_105053 (p = 0.03) were found to differ significantly between the untreated TB group and the cured TB group. The predicted target genes of uc.48+ were EP300, BAI1 and NR_105053 were TLR9, MYD88, BAI1, respectively. A predictive model for cured TB was established by the combination of uc.48+ and NR_105053 expression, with a sensitivity of 90.00% and specificity of 86.36%, and an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.945.
Conclusions
lncRNAs uc.48+ and NR_105053 may serve as potential biomarkers to distinguish between untreated TB patients and cured TB subjects. This study provides an experimental basis to evaluate the effect of TB treatment and may also provide new clues to the pathological mechanisms of TB."

Pregnant women are in the highest priority group for receiving influenza vaccination. However, they may be reluctant to receive the vaccination due to concerns about the influence of vaccination on the fetuses.
Methods
This prospective cohort study of 10 330 pregnant women examined the safety of influenza vaccination in terms of adverse birth outcomes. Influenza vaccination during pregnancy was determined from questionnaires before and after the 2013/2014 influenza season. All subjects were followed until the end of their pregnancy. Adverse birth outcomes, including miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth, low birth weight, and malformation, were assessed by obstetrician reports.
Results
Adverse birth outcomes were reported for 641 (10%) of the 6387 unvaccinated pregnant women and 356 (9%) of the 3943 vaccinated pregnant women. Even after adjusting for potential confounders, vaccination during pregnancy showed no association with the risk of adverse birth outcomes (odds ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.76–1.07). Vaccination during the first or second trimester displayed no association with adverse birth outcomes, whereas vaccination during the third trimester was associated with a decreased risk of adverse birth outcomes (odds ratio 0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.51–0.98).
Conclusions
Influenza vaccination during pregnancy did not increase the risk of adverse birth outcomes, regardless of the trimester in which vaccination was performed, when compared to unvaccinated pregnant women."

The risk factors and the impact of NAI treatments in patients with severe influenza A-associated pneumonia remain unclear.
Methods
A multicenter, retrospective, observational study was conducted in Zhejiang, China during a severe influenza epidemic in August 2017–May 2018. Clinical records of patients (>14 y) hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza A virus infection and who developed severe pneumonia were compared to those with mild-to-moderate pneumonia. Risk factors related to pneumonia severity and effects of NAI treatments (monotherapy and combination of peramivir and oseltamivir) were analyzed.
Results
202 patients with influenza A-associated severe pneumonia were enrolled, of whom 84 (41.6%) had died. Male gender (OR = 1.782; 95% CI: 1.089–2.917; P = 0.022), chronic pulmonary disease (OR = 2.581; 95% CI: 1.447–4.603; P = 0.001) and diabetes mellitus (OR = 2.042; 95% CI: 1.135–3.673; P = 0.017) were risk factors related to influenza A pneumonia severity. In cox proportional hazards model, severe pneumonia patients treated with double dose oseltamivir (300mg/d) had a better survival rate compared to those receiving a single dose (150 mg/d) (HR = 0.475; 95%CI: 0.254–0.887; P = 0.019). However, different doses of peramivir (300 mg/d vs. 600 mg/d) and combination therapy (oseltamivir-peramivir vs. monotherapy) showed no differences in 60-day mortality (P = 0.392 and P = 0.658, respectively).
Conclusions
Patients with male gender, chronic pulmonary disease, or diabetes mellitus were at high risk of developing severe pneumonia after influenza A infection. Double dose oseltamivir might be considered in treating influenza A-associated severe pneumonia."

Host genetic polymorphisms may be important in determining susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, but their role is not fully understood. Detection of microbial DNA and activation of type I interferon (IFN) pathways regulate macrophage responses to Mtb infection.
Methods
We examined whether seven candidate gene SNPs were associated with tuberculin skin test (TST) positivity in close contacts of microbiologically confirmed pulmonary TB patients in Brazil. Independent associations with TST positivity were tested using multivariable logistic regression (using genotypes and clinical variables) and genetic models.
Results
Among 482 contacts of 145 TB index cases, 296 contacts were TST positive. Multivariable regression analysis adjusted for population admixture, age, family relatedness, sex and clinical variables related to increased TB risk demonstrated that SNPs in PYHIN1-IFI16-AIM2 rs1101998 (adjusted OR [aOR]: 3.72; 95%CI=1.15–12.0; p=0.028) and in PYHIN1-IFI16-AIM2 rs1633256 (aOR=24.84; 95%CI=2.26–272.95; p=0.009) were associated with TST positivity in a recessive model.

Given the improvements in antiretroviral therapy (ART) in recent years, more pediatric HIV patients receiving ART are reaching adolescence and adulthood. This study investigated the influence of poor virological response (low-level viremia (LLV) and virological failure (VF)) on the immune system of these patients.
Methods
HIV-infected, ART-experienced pediatric patients (n=206) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. The patients were subdivided into school-age children/early adolescents, middle adolescents, and late adolescents/young adults according to their age, and further classified into virological suppression (VS), LLV, and VF groups according to plasma viral load (pVL) measurement. Thymic output, T cells subsets, and immune activation were analyzed by flow cytometry.
Results
Compared with VS patients, VF patients displayed decreased CD4+ T cell counts, while LLV and VS patients had comparable CD4+ T cell counts regardless of age. Compared with VS patients, LLV and VF patients had higher percentages of CD8+HLA-DR+ and CD8+CD38high T cells, and the immune activation was positively correlated with pVL in VF and LLV patients. Thymic output levels (CD31+) and regulatory T cell subpopulations in LLV and VF patients were comparable to those in VS patients. LLV patients showed comparable percentages of T cell subsets (TN, TCM, TEMRA, and TEM) as VS patients in all age groups.
Conclusions
LLV causes excessive immune activation although it does not impair T cell recovery or naïve-to-memory T cell conversion in pediatric patients living with HIV. Therefore, T cell immune activation should be monitored at the management of LLV during ART."

abstract = "Objectives
Sex workers (SWs) face an increased burden of sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections, yet little is known regarding hepatitis B virus (HBV) prevention and care. This study was performed to characterize cross-sectional and prospective correlates of HBV vaccination among SWs in Vancouver.
Methods
Questionnaire data were drawn from a community-based cohort of SWs (2010–2017). Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine correlates of lifetime self-reported HBV vaccination. Multivariable generalized estimating equation (GEE) regression was used to assess correlates of recent vaccination.
Results
Among 855 participants, 68.3% reported lifetime HBV vaccination. Multivariable logistic regression showed that im/migrants (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32–0.78) had lower odds of vaccination and that those using injection drugs (AOR 1.88, 95% CI 1.27– 2.78) and those who had undergone HIV testing (AOR 1.94, 95% CI 1.14–3.29) had higher odds of vaccination. In the multivariable GEE analysis, HIV seropositivity (AOR 1.93, 95% CI 1.26–2.97) and recent STI testing (AOR 2.95, 95% CI 1.99–4.39) correlated with recent HBV vaccination.
Conclusions
Im/migrant SWs from HBV-endemic settings appear to face gaps in HBV prevention. Evidence-based interventions addressing gaps in voluntary HBV prevention and care are needed, including community-based and culturally safe services. Injection drug use and HIV testing were linked to enhanced vaccination, suggesting that harm reduction and HIV programmes may facilitate linkage to HBV prevention."

Our study aimed to assess antibiotic use in adult inpatients in the context of limited laboratory services at the main tertiary hospital in Sierra Leone.
Design
A cross-sectional study of consecutive adult inpatients (≥18 years) between October 2017 and February 2018 at Connaught Hospital in Freetown.
Results
A total of 920 patients were interviewed, of which 753 (81.8%) had at least one antibiotic. Complete data was captured for 688 (91.0%) patients. The median age was 41 years and 52.8% were male. Fever was reported in 41.5% of patients, though 85.1% had no leukocyte count prior to antibiotic use and none had a bacterial culture. Indications for prescribing were surgical prophylaxis (15.7%), pneumonia (15.1%), and trauma (5.8%). Cephalosporins (25.9%), penicillins (23.2%), and imidazoles (20.8%) were commonly prescribed.
Conclusion
We found high rates of antibiotic use, of which most was not based on laboratory evidence. Lack of oversight and microbiological support are drivers of poor prescribing in many developing countries, which lack financial resources and serve a sicker population. Greater investments are needed to establish antimicrobial stewardship programs and provide clinicians with diagnostic support to enable improvements in patient outcomes and curb the spread of antibiotic resistance."

The epidemiology and role of the anti-PcrV titer in non-cystic fibrosis patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway tract infections is not fully understood. This study was performed to compare the anti-PcrV titers of patients with and without P. aeruginosa respiratory tract infections.
Methods
This prospective cohort study was conducted at Hokkaido University Hospital in Japan. Participants had blood and sputum specimens collected on admission. They were divided into two groups based on their sputum culture results. Those with a P. aeruginosa infection were assigned to the P. aeruginosa (PA) group and those without a P. aeruginosa infection were assigned to the non-PA group. Serum anti-PcrV titers were measured using a validated ELISA.
Results
Of the 44 participants, 15 were assigned to the PA group and 29 were assigned to the non-PA group. In the PA group, 10/15 participants (66.7%) had an anti-PcrV titer >1000ng/ml compared to 3/29 participants (10.3%) in the non-PA group (p<0.001). In the PA group, two of the five participants with an anti-PcrV titer <1000 ng/ml died of recurrent P. aeruginosa pneumonia; the other three participants did not develop pneumonia.
Conclusion
The anti-PcrV titers in participants with P. aeruginosa infection varied considerably. Patients with low anti-PcrV titers and refractory P. aeruginosa infections need to be monitored closely."

A health facility-based cross-sectional survey.
Results
In total, 1114 (87.6%) new and 158 (12.4%) retreatment TB patients were enrolled. MTB was confirmed by Xpert MTB/RIF among 1184 (93%) smear-positive sputum samples. There were 64 samples with Xpert MTB/RIF-determined rifampicin resistance. However, two were rifampicin susceptible on phenotypic drug susceptibility testing. The prevalence of RR-TB was [4.0% (95% CI, 2.9, 5.4%), n=42/1043) and 14.2% (95% CI, 8.9, 21.1%; n=20/141) among new and retreatment patients, respectively. The prevalence of MDR-TB was 2.0% (95% CI, 1.3, 3.1%) and 6.4% (95% CI, 2.4, 10.3%) among new and retreatment TB patients, respectively. Risk factors for RR-TB included prior TB treatment, self-reported HIV infection, travel outside Zimbabwe for ≥one month (univariate), and age <15 years. Having at least a secondary education was protective against RR-TB.
Conclusion
The prevalence of MDR-TB in Zimbabwe has remained stable since the 1994 subnational survey. However, the prevalence of rifampicin mono-resistance was double that of MDR-TB."

abstract = "Objectives
Vertebral osteomyelitis (VO) is a compelling clinical entity for clinicians because of its insidious and indolent course, which makes diagnosis difficult.
Methods
All patients with a suspected diagnosis of VO were analyzed over an 8-year period (January 2009 to January 2017). The UDIPROVE protocol (UDIne PROtocol on VErtebral osteomyelitis) was applied in all cases. The primary endpoint was the performance of the UDIPROVE protocol to obtain the causal bacteria of infection.
Results
During the study period, 133 episodes of confirmed VO were observed. The etiology of infection was obtained in 73.6% of cases: 70.5% were gram-positive, 16.3% were gram-negative, and 13.2% were mycobacteria. 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) showed that for tubercular VO, the median standard uptake value (SUV) was higher when compared with VO caused by other bacteria. Clinical cure at the end of therapy was reported in 85.7% of patients. Previous antimicrobial therapy and a delay of more than 5 days in performing biopsy were associated with an undiagnosed etiology of VO. Targeted antibacterial therapy and follow-up with FDG-PET/CT were associated with clinical cure at the end of therapy, while the involvement of more than two vertebrae and inadequate drainage were associated with failure.
Conclusions
Rigorous application of the UDIPROVE protocol allowed the causative pathogens of VO to be obtained – at about twice the rate reported in the literature. The use of FDG-PET/CT for the follow-up of infection was more reliable when compared to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)."

Orthohantaviruses are still a significant public health threat in endemic countries, with high case fatality rates (CFR). In Bolivia, the reporting of small outbreaks occurred until 2012. The findings of 40 laboratory-confirmed cases diagnosed in two departments are reported herein.
Methods
This was an observational, retrospective and cross-sectional study. Data on laboratory-confirmed cases in 2018 were collected from the hospitals and departmental health services (SEDES) of Santa Cruz and Tarija. An ELISA was used for the detection of IgM antibody to hantavirus in the patient blood samples.
Results
Forty patients were IgM-positive. The median age of the patients was 24 years (interquartile range 19–41 years) and 72.5% were male. All patients were hospitalized; 57.5% were admitted to the intensive care unit and had cardiopulmonary compromise, with 83% of these presenting acute respiratory distress syndrome and 89.5% of these requiring mechanical ventilation. Six patients died (CFR 15%). Patients <15 or >60 years old were more prone to die (odds ratio 10.33, 95% confidence interval 1.411–75.694), as were those with comorbidities (odds ratio 16.5, 95% confidence interval 1.207–225.540).
Conclusions
Orthohantavirus infections were associated with a high CFR. These cases occurred in areas with eco-epidemiological conditions facilitating viral transmission, including the presence of rodents, as well as the risk of spillover to humans due to social, environmental, and occupational factors."

The aim of this study was to identify the predictors of relapse after the withdrawal of nucleos(t)ide analog (NA) therapy in patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB).
Methods
The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science databases were searched through January 2019. A random-effects model meta-analysis was performed, with hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) used as summary statistics.
Results
Seventeen studies were included in the meta-analysis. Age (HR=1.022 per year), baseline hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (HR=1.509 per log IU/l), end of treatment (EOT) HBsAg level (HR=1.896 per log IU/l), EOT HBsAg level ≥1000 IU/ml (HR=1.749), and HBsAg decline from baseline to EOT (HR=0.748 per log IU/l) were associated with virological relapse. The predictors of clinical relapse were baseline HBsAg level (HR=1.312 per log IU/l), EOT HBsAg level (HR=1.458 per log IU/l), EOT HBsAg level ≥100IU/ml (HR=3.199) or ≥1000 IU/ml (HR=1.810), and duration of consolidation therapy (HR=0.991 per month).
Conclusions
This meta-analysis indicates that age, the duration of consolidation therapy, and levels of baseline and EOT HBsAg were factors predictive of relapse in HBeAg-negative CHB patients who discontinued NA treatment."

Results
Out of 8598 patients registered, 8324 (96.8%) were reached and 8073 (93.9%) were screened for TB, of whom 1703 (21.1%) were found to be presumptive TB patients. A total of 275 (16.7%) were diagnosed with all forms of TB, of whom 90.5% were women. Eighty-eight (32%) of them were bacteriologically confirmed and 187 (68%) were clinically diagnosed. The number needed to screen (NNS) was 29.3 and the number needed to test (NNT) was 6.1. The overall prevalence of TB among mentally ill patients was 3,567/100,000—20 times higher than the national incidence rate. TB was independently associated with married and widowed adults, young adults, females, and oral sleep drug users.

Results
Through retrospective analysis, there was an obvious decline in ICP as well as Cryptococcus count after VP shunting. Damage to the cranial nerves was improved after the surgery. For those patients receiving VP shunting, there was an obvious decline in ICP as well as Cryptococcus count, with less usage of mannitol. Hydrocephalus or ventriculomegaly was improved, and both the clearance time of Cryptococcus and the hospitalization time were shortened (p<0.05). The complications of VP shunting were not common.
Conclusions
For patients diagnosed with CM and with apparent ICP, VP shunting can be considered regardless of whether there is damage to the cranial nerves or hydrocephaly."

Spinal hydatid disease is rare and remains a serious health problem associated with high rates of recurrence. We report our experience in treating patients with thoracic spinal hydatidosis through a single-center case-series study.
Methods
Sixteen patients with thoracic spinal hydatidosis were treated in our center between 1995 and 2017. A total en bloc spondylectomy (TES) was performed in three patients. Five patients were treated with posterior decompression and stabilization after removing the involved elements. The remaining patients underwent curettage and resection of the infected bone. The therapy was completed with medical treatment or radiotherapy.
Results
Of the 16 patients, seven were men and nine were women; their mean age was 38.5 years (range 28–60 years). The infected area was the upper thoracic level in one patient, mid thoracic level in eight patients, and lower thoracic level in seven patients. Four patients had paraplegia and seven had paraparesis before surgery. At the last follow-up, five patients had successfully recovered from the neurological damage. During a mean follow-up of 4.75 years (range 2–12 years), eight patients had local recurrence; however, no patient who underwent TES had recurrence.
Conclusions
An individualized surgical strategy should be decided carefully for each patient in the first intervention. In the early stages of the disease, TES should be considered as a treatment for suitable cases of primary thoracic spinal hydatidosis."

Yellow fever virus historically was a frequent threat to American and European coasts. Medical milestones such as the discovery of mosquitoes as vectors and subsequently an effective vaccine significantly reduced its incidence, in spite of which, thousands of cases of this deathly disease still occur regularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Amazonian basin in South America, which are usually not reported. An urban outbreak in Angola, consecutive years of increasing incidence near major Brazilian cities, and imported cases in China, South America and Europe, have brought this virus back to the global spotlight. The aim of this article is to underline that the preventive YFV measures, such as vaccination, need to be carefully revised in order to minimize the risks of new YFV outbreaks, especially in urban or immunologically vulnerable places. Furthermore, this article highlights the diverse factors that have favored the spread of other Aedes spp.-associated arboviral diseases like Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika, to northern latitudes causing epidemics in the United States and Europe, emphasizing the possibility that YFV might follow the path of these viruses unless enhanced surveillance and efficient control systems are urgently initiated."

Occult hepatitis B virus infection (OBI) is defined as the presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in serum and/or liver from HBsAg-negative subjects. Our aim was to determine OBI frequency in serum and genomic DNA in patients undergoing renal transplant and their cognate donors in a selected population from Western Mexico.
Methods
Blood samples were obtained from 94 donors and their cognate recipients (188 participants) before kidney transplantation. Identification of HBV DNA was carried-out by nested (S-region) and semi-nested (Pol-region) PCR in both genomic and serum DNA samples from 188 participants at pre-surgical stage and from a subset of 73 recipients at three-month follow-up.
Results
HBV-DNA was not detected in either genomic or serum DNA samples from recipients or donors prior to transplantation. After three-months of follow-up, 2 out of 73 (2.7%, 95% CI: 0.9–11.9%) recipients were positive to HBV-DNA (Pol-region) in genomic DNA samples using a high sensitivity Taq DNA polymerase.
Conclusions
OBI incidence in recipients of kidney transplant may be higher than previously recognized. Detection of HBV-DNA was higher in genomic DNA than in serum samples using a high sensitivity Taq DNA polymerase. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report regarding this specific topic in Mexicans."

Between 2013 and 2017, a total of 22 847 unique entries were added to the database. The top three initial and definitive information sources varied considerably by disease. Ebola entries dominated the database, making up 23.7% of the total, followed by Zika (11.8%), Middle East respiratory syndrome (6.7%), cholera (5.5%), and yellow fever and undiagnosed morbidity (both 3.3%). Initial reports of major outbreaks due to the top five disease agents were picked up through the manual system prior to being publicly reported by official sources.
Conclusions
PHE’s manual EI process quickly and accurately detected global public health threats at the earliest stages and allowed for monitoring of events as they evolved."

To determine blood Brucella DNA loads between brucellosis patients and those without brucellosis.
Methods
The patient group included 350 brucellosis patients. The control was composed of 200 subjects without brucellosis. The extracted DNA from blood was tested by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The cutoff value was determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. A portion of the brucellosis patients were monitored by qPCR during therapy.
Results
The detection limit of qPCR was between 1E+01cfu/μL and 1E+08cfu/μL. The standard curve R2 reached 0.998. The cutoff value was 4E+01cfu/μL, which was determined by comparison of the patient group and the control. The qPCR assay had a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 93.14%. The monitoring results showed that the Brucella DNA load decreased in most patients during the first 4 weeks of treatment. One patient with bad treatment compliance showed a rebound.
Conclusions
The qPCR results were in accordance with the course of brucellosis in the clinic. The DNA load often reflects the situation of the Brucella-infected patient. The cutoff value provides an important reference of infection. This qPCR-based method can be used to assist in the diagnosis of brucellosis and to adjust the therapy."

abstract = "Objectives
Most previous studies on poor immunological responders (PIRs) have been performed on one cohort at one time-point following highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The aim of this study was to investigate whether there are different subtypes of PIR and whether a certain population might achieve better immune reconstitution following longer HAART.
Methods
This study was designed as an ambispective cohort study, including a 4–5-year retrospective study and a 2-year prospective follow-up investigation. Thymic output, activated T cell and regulatory T cell (Treg) subset frequencies, expression levels of interferon-stimulated genes, and plasma concentrations of neopterin were determined at 4–5 years and 6–7 years following HAART initiation.
Results
PIRs were subdivided into two populations after 4–5 years of HAART, according to the kinetics of T cell recovery. Type II PIRs exhibited a significantly lower percentage of naïve CD4+ T cells and CD31+ naïve CD4+ T cells compared with type I PIRs. After an additional 2 years of HAART treatment, type I PIRs showed a better outcome than type II PIRs. Furthermore, it was found that 2 years of additional HAART could persistently improve thymic output.
Conclusions
The two PIR subgroups are different in terms of immune characteristics and the response to prolonged HAART."

The aim of this study was to determine the long-term incidence of cryptococcosis in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) and to analyze its risk factors.
Methods
This retrospective population-based cohort study analyzed data obtained from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database for KTRs during 2000–2012 and matched cohorts. Both populations were followed until death, development of cryptococcosis, or December 2013.
Results
A total of 4,933 KTRs and 49,930 matched patients were included. The cryptococcosis incidence rates for the KTR cohort and matched cohort were 10.59 and 0.4 per 10,000 person-years, respectively. The hazard ratio for cryptococcosis among KTRs was 26.65 (p<0.001); and 43.77 (p<0.001) for cryptococcosis affecting the central nervous system (CNS). The Kaplan-Meier method confirmed an elevated cumulative incidence of cryptococcosis among KTRs (1.00% vs. 0.04%). Predictors for cryptococcosis were advanced age (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.02–1.89, P=0.038) and cancer (OR 2.63, 95% CI 1.22–5.67, P=0.013), but not the use of any particular class of immunosuppressants.
Conclusions
KTRs are at dramatically higher risk of developing cryptococcosis, especially with CNS involvement, relative to a non-KTR matched cohort. Older KTRs and those with cancer are at even higher risk of developing cryptococcosis."

Methodology
This paper’s findings are based on the retrospective analysis of the National Surveillance System’s collected data from 2016 to 2018. Weekly cases exceeding the 90th percentile of the expected number of cases were considered to be exceptional and above normal.
Results
The National Surveillance System detected 1,284 CCHF cases from 2007 to 2018, of which 163 cases were in 2016, 245 cases in 2017 and 483 cases in 2018. A total of 891 suspected and confirmed cases were reported between 2016 and 2018, 293 (33%) of these cases were confirmed by detecting IgM antibody using ELISA and RT-PCR. Among confirmed cases, the three-year case fatality ratio (CFR) was 43.3%. Among the reported cases, 68.5% were males and 31.5% females. The frequent reported occupational groups were housewives (15%), health staff (13%), shepherds (11%), butchers (6%), students (6%), animal dealers and farmers (both 2%) respectively, 19% were unemployed, and occupation was not recorded for 26% of cases.
Conclusion
Recently, CCHF has significantly increased in Afghanistan. Despite the increased frequency of cases, the laboratory capacity to test specimens and overall knowledge of CCHF management remains limited."

To investigate varicella outbreak trends among schoolchildren during the voluntary single-dose varicella vaccine (VarV) era in Shanghai, China.
Methods
Trends in school varicella outbreaks from 2006 to 2017 were assessed using joinpoint regression models. The impacts of changes in single-dose VarV coverage among schoolchildren and implementation of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) strategies on outbreak trends were further analyzed.
Results
In total, 265 varicella outbreaks involving 3263 cases were reported in Shanghai from 2006 to 2017. The number of outbreaks showed an increasing trend from 2006 to 2017 (t=2.62, p=0.026), especially in kindergartens. The proportion of breakthrough varicella cases among all outbreak-related cases showed an increasing trend from 30.4% in 2008 to 85.7% in 2017 (t=7.45, p<0.001). Single-dose VarV coverage among schoolchildren was 88.1%, and showed a significant increase from the 1996 to the 2008 birth cohorts, followed by a non-significant decline from the 2008 to the 2014 birth cohorts. During school outbreaks in which PEP campaigns were conducted, the varicella attack rate was significantly lower than those in outbreaks without PEP campaigns (1.2% vs. 1.4%; Chi-square=23.35, p<0.001).
Conclusions
Even with high coverage, single-dose VarV is insufficient to prevent school outbreaks. The administration of VarV as PEP is an appropriate intervention for varicella outbreak control prior to implementing a two-dose VarV schedule."

The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical features of nocardiosis after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), focusing on new Nocardia species.
Methods
We retrospectively reviewed data from patients with nocardiosis after allo-HSCT treated at our hospital and documented cases in the medical literature.
Results
Fifty-seven cases were identified from our institution and the literature review. Although 51 patients (89.5%) responded to initial treatment, 28 (49.1%) patients were switched over to other treatment regimens due to the recurrence of nocardiosis or adverse events of antimicrobials. Nocardiosis-attributed mortality occurred in ten patients (17.5%). Antimicrobial susceptibilities varied among intra- and inter-species except linezolid (LZD). In the present study, five species were newly discovered after 2000, including N. cyriacigeorgica, N. veterana, N. abscessus, N. aobensis, and N. mexicana. All isolates of N. cyriacigeorgica, N. veterana, N. abscessus, and N. aobensis were sensitive to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, amikacin (AMK), imipenem (IPM), and LZD; however, N. mexicana was resistant to AMK and IPM.
Conclusion
Newly identified Nocardia species have various antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. Long-term maintenance therapy could be challenging due to the adverse events of antimicrobials, especially in the allo-HSCT setting. Prudent evaluation is crucial for selecting a second-line or further treatment options."

Recommendations in clinical practice guidelines (CPG) may differ and cause confusion. Our objective was to appraise CPGs for antifungal treatment of invasive candidiasis (IC) in non-neutropenic critically ill adult patients.
Methods
We systematically searched the literature for CPGs published between 2008 and 2018. We assessed the quality of each guideline using six domains of the AGREE II instrument. We extracted and compared recommendations for different treatment strategies and assessed content quality.
Results
Of 19 guidelines, the mean overall AGREE II score was 58%. The domain ‘clarity of presentation’ received the highest scores (88%) and ‘applicability’ the lowest (18%). CPGs provided detailed recommendations on antifungal prophylaxis (n = 10), with fluconazole recommended as initial prophylaxis in all seven CPGs citing a specific drug. Echinocandin was recommended as the initial drug in all 16 CPGs supporting empirical/pre-emptive treatment; and in 18 of 19 for targeted invasive candidiasis treatment. However, it remains unclear when to initiate prophylaxis, empirical or pre-emptive therapy or when to step down.
Conclusions
The methodological quality of CPGs for antifungal treatment of IC in non-neutropenic critically ill patients is suboptimal. Some treatment recommendations were inconsistent across indications and require local guidance to help clinicians make better informed decisions."

abstract = "Objectives
In recent years, Italy has been registering peaks in death rates, particularly among the elderly during the winter season. Influenza epidemics have been indicated as one of the potential determinants of such an excess. The objective of our study was to estimate the influenza-attributable contribution to excess mortality during the influenza seasons from 2013/14 to 2016/17 in Italy.
Methods
We used the EuroMomo and the FluMomo methods to estimate the annual trend of influenza-attributable excess death rate by age group. Population data were provided by the National Institute of Statistics, data on influenza like illness and confirmed influenza cases were provided by the National Institutes of Health. As an indicator of weekly influenza activity (IA) we adopted the Goldstein index, which is the product of the percentage of patients seen with influenza-like illness (ILI) and percentage of influenza-positive specimens, in a given week.
Results
We estimated excess deaths of 7,027, 20,259, 15,801 and 24,981 attributable to influenza epidemics in the 2013/14, 2014/15, 2015/16 and 2016/17, respectively, using the Goldstein index. The average annual mortality excess rate per 100,000 ranged from 11.6 to 41.2 with most of the influenza-associated deaths per year registered among the elderly. However children less than 5 years old also reported a relevant influenza attributable excess death rate in the 2014/15 and 2016/17 seasons (1.05/100,000 and 1.54/100,000 respectively).
Conclusions
Over 68,000 deaths were attributable to influenza epidemics in the study period. The observed excess of deaths is not completely unexpected, given the high number of fragile very old subjects living in Italy. In conclusion, the unpredictability of the influenza virus continues to present a major challenge to health professionals and policy makers. Nonetheless, vaccination remains the most effective means for reducing the burden of influenza, and efforts to increase vaccine coverage and the introduction of new vaccine strategies (such as vaccinating healthy children) should be considered to reduce the influenza attributable excess mortality experienced in Italy and in Europe in the last seasons."

Breast tuberculosis (TB) is a rare disease, still present in endemic areas. The significance of breast TB is due to its rare occurrence and its resemblance to malignant breast lesions.

Methods
A retrospective study was conducted over a 10-year period. Thirty-two consecutive patients diagnosed with tuberculous mastitis were included.
Results
There was only one male patient in this series. The patients ranged in age from 25 to 60 years (mean age was 33.69 years). A solitary breast mass was the most common clinical presentation, which was associated with inflammatory findings in the majority of cases. The most common mammographic finding was diffusely increased density and the most common pathological finding was solitary mass. The most common appearance on ultrasound was of multiple intercommunicating breast masses with axillary lymphadenopathy.
Conclusions
Breast TB should be considered in the differential diagnosis in the presence of a painful breast mass, discharging sinuses, mastitis, or a breast abscess that does not respond to conventional medical treatment. A multidisciplinary approach is required to aid timely diagnosis and to provide appropriate management and treatment in order to avoid complications."

Methods
From June 2012 to June 2013, stool samples were collected from hospitalized young children with acute gastroenteritis. A total of 545 samples were tested for GI and GII norovirus infections using nested duplex reverse-transcription–polymerase chain reaction and sequencing.
Results
The GI and GII norovirus infection were detected in 148 samples. Males (28%) were not significantly more infected than females (25%). Norovirus infection was found exclusively in children aged under 24 months with a higher prevalence (P=0,048) in the age group of 7–12 months, and throughout the year with a peak in August and September. Genetic diversity of norovirus strains revealed that GII was the most prevalent (87%). No risk factor was significantly associated with norovirus infection.

Hand hygiene (HH) is crucial to prevent healthcare-associated infections and the spread of multidrug-resistant organisms. The monitoring of HH compliance may be affected by observer expertise. A sufficient duration of HH is necessary to remove microorganisms. The aim of this study was to measure compliance with both the World Health Organization (WHO) checklist and optimal HH as reported by unit-based observers and infection control nurses (ICN).
Methods
Optimal HH was defined as adhering to the exact duration and following a six-step procedure. The disparity in compliance with the WHO checklist and optimal HH was analyzed among each profession, unit, and indication, covering a period of 3 years.
Results
There was a statistically significant difference in WHO checklist compliance (94.4% vs. 87.0%, p<0.01) and optimal HH rate (86.3% vs. 42.4%, p<0.01) between unit-based observers and ICN. The optimal HH rate was especially lower for doctors (30.1%), in the intensive care units (39.4%), and before clean and aseptic procedures (37.0%) as observed by ICN.
Conclusions
Although the overall WHO checklist HH rate was reported to be higher than 90%, optimal HH was only half this rate. More education and awareness of the significance of HH, as well as adherence to the optimal HH procedures, are needed to prevent hospital-acquired infections."

Local health personnel have drawn attention to an apparent increase in incidence and severity of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Sudan. The objective of this study was to investigate CL burden and surveillance.
Methods
Surveillance data were compiled from the KalaCORE programme, Leishmania coordinators in Northern Kordofan and Southern Darfur, and Khartoum Dermatology Hospital. CL lesions were sampled from 14 suspected cases from Northern Kordofan and the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Omdurman. PCR–restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and multilocus sequencing were used to characterize the disease agent.
Results
All sites reported substantial increases from 2014 to 2016/7, far exceeding World Health Organization case reports for 2014, consistent with a widespread outbreak. Single seasonal peak incidence was observed, except for two peaks in Southern Darfur. In Northern Kordofan, the odds ratio for CL in the 35–44 years age group was 2.6 times higher than in the >45 years age group (p<0.0001); in Southern Darfur, the OR was 2.38 greater in males than females (p<0.0001). Lesions included severe presentations, despite chemotherapy. Leishmania major was identified as the agent.
Conclusions
Active surveillance is required to understand the extent of CL in Sudan, as well as training to standardize surveillance, diagnosis, reporting, and quality control. Point-of-care rapid diagnosis would be valuable. Genotyping and phenotyping are required to monitor the emergence of pathogenic strains, drug resistance, outbreaks, and changes in severity."

Methods
Thirty-seven treatment-naive women received ART from the third trimester of pregnancy to 6 months post delivery (end of the breastfeeding period). ART continuation (group C) or interruption (group I) was then decided on the basis of the CD4+ cell count at enrolment (>350 or ≤350/μl). Total IgG and IgG subclasses were determined in maternal serum using a nephelometric assay at baseline and at 6 and 24 months postpartum.

At enrolment, 36/37 women had IgG levels >15g/l and there was a predominance of the IgG1 isotype (more than 90%) in parallel with underrepresentation of IgG2 (5.0%). After 6 months of ART, both groups showed a significant median decrease in total IgG (−3.1g/l in group I, −3.5g/l in group C) and in IgG1 (−4.0g/l and −3.6g/l, respectively), but only a modest recovery in IgG2 levels (+0.16 in group I, +0.14g/l in group C). At month 24, hypergammaglobulinemia was still present in 73.7% of women in group C, although a significant reduction was observed in total IgG level and in IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses (p<0.0001 in all cases). IgG2 levels did not show any significant change. In group I at 24 months, total IgG and IgG subclasses had returned to levels comparable to those at baseline.
Conclusions
The beneficial effects of 24 months of ART appear to be limited in the B-cell compartment, with an incomplete reduction of total IgG levels and no recovery of IgG2 depletion. A short ART period did not have significant effects on IgG abnormalities in women who interrupted treatment."

New efficient strategies are needed for the assessment of active hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of HCV core antigen (HCV-cAg) as a marker of active HCV infection in newly diagnosed patients, for treatment monitoring, and for the detection of therapeutic failure.
Materials and methods
A prospective study was conducted at a regional reference hospital in Spain. HCV-cAg and viral load (RNA-HCV) were tested in plasma or serum samples from three patient groups: new diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and treatment failure. The treatment monitoring group was tested at the beginning of treatment, at 4 weeks post-initiation, at the end of treatment, and at 12 weeks post-treatment completion. The Architect HCV core antigen assay was performed for HCV-cAg testing, and viral load was quantified with the Cobas 6800 system.
Results
A total of 303 samples from 124 patients were analyzed. Excellent correlation was seen between HCV-cAg and HCV-RNA (R2=0.932). The optimal cut-off value was 3fmol/l in the receiver operating characteristics curve analysis, and the area under the curve was 0.987 (95% confidence interval 0.972–1.000). HCV-cAg sensitivity and specificity were 97% and 95%, respectively. Most diverging results were observed in the treatment follow-up group.
Conclusions
HCV-cAg demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity as a marker for active HCV infection, new diagnosis, detection of antiviral therapeutic failure, and treatment monitoring."

Pseudorabies virus (PRV) has been thought to cause diseases only in animals. However, recent studies have shown that PRV can also cause illnesses in humans.
Methods
This was a case series study. The cases of five patients with clinical symptoms of acute encephalitis, which were confirmed to be caused by PRV infections, were reviewed.
Case presentation
The five patients all had jobs involving the handling of pigs. They had acute onset and rapid progression of clinical presentations, which were consistent with central nervous system infections. Four of them had respiratory failure, which required ventilator support. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed abnormal signals in the bilateral temporal lobes and insular cortex in all five patients, bilateral frontal lobes in one patient, and caudate nucleus in one patient. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis results were consistent with a viral infection. Next-generation sequencing of the cerebrospinal fluid confirmed the presence of PRV. All patients received human immunoglobulin, glucocorticoids, antiviral agents, and symptomatic supportive treatments. All patients survived until discharge, but suffered from various sequelae. Pneumonia was the most common complication during the disease course.
Conclusions
PRV encephalitis should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with a clinical presentation of central nervous system infection, especially for those who have had recent contact with pigs."

The aim of this study was to elaborate on and validate a score for the early diagnosis of mediastinitis after cardiothoracic surgery.
Methods
Between 2007 and 2017, patients who experienced thoracic surgical-site infection after cardiothoracic surgery were enrolled. Laboratory, clinical, and chest CT findings were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were followed up until hospital discharge or intra-hospital death. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed.
Results
950 surgical-site infections were found and analyzed (131 mediastinitis, 819 superficial/deep infections). Of the 131 mediastinitis episodes, 88% required surgical thoracic debridement,Staphylococcus aureus was identified in 43%, and overall mortality was 42%. The following variables were related to mediastinitis diagnosis: sternal diastasis (OR=2.5; 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.2–5.3; P=0.012), bilateral pleural effusion (OR=1.9; 95%CI: 1.0–3.6; P=0.04), leukocyte count ≥14,000cells/mm3 (OR=2.5; 95%CI: 1.3–4.7; P=0.006), male sex (OR=2; 95%CI: 1.11–4; P=0.022), and positive blood culture (OR=3.0; 95%CI: 1.6–5.6; P=0.001). The score predicted with reasonable accuracy mediastinitis in the derivation cohort (AUC-ROC, 0.7476) and the validation cohort (AUC-ROC, 0.7149). Groups with high (31%) and low (5%) risk of mediastinitis were identified.
Conclusions
An early diagnostic score in patients with surgical-site infection after cardiothoracic surgery identified groups with a low and high risk for mediastinitis."

As the current recommendation of administering Tdap (tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis) to all pregnant women has not been widely implemented in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), we aimed to ascertain the prevalence of pertussis seronegativity during pregnancy.
Methods
IgG antibodies against Bordetella pertussis toxin (PT) were measured in 213 women attending the antenatal clinic at Oasis hospital, Al Ain, UAE. Results were compared by maternal age, nationality and gestational age with the Kruskal–Wallis test for IgG-PT levels and the Chi-squared test for serology status.
Results
The mean age±SD of the participants was 30.4±5.6 years, mean gestational age±SD of 25.5±3.3 weeks. Serum concentration of IgG-PT <10IU/ml were found in 160 out of 213 women (75%; 95% confidence interval 69%, 81%). There was no significant difference in the geometric mean of serum IgG-PT concentration across maternal age (P=0.80) or nationality (P=0.90). There were no differences in the prevalence of seronegativity with maternal age (P=0.65) or nationality (P=0.90).

Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most important pathogens that cause acute respiratory infections in children and immunocompromised adults. This work was conducted to understand the epidemiological and phylogenetic features of RSV in southern China during 2011–2016.
Methods
A total of 16 024 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from patients with respiratory infections in 14 hospitals, and screened for RSV and seven other respiratory viruses using real-time PCR. Six hundred and twenty-three RSV-positive samples from 13 hospitals were further analyzed for subtypes. G gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were performed based on 46 RSV-A and 15 RSV-B strains.
Results
RSV was detected in 9.5% of the 16 024 specimens, the highest among the eight respiratory viruses screened. Most of these specimens came from inpatients and children under 3 years of age. The incidence of RSV-A (9.4%) was higher than that of RSV-B (4.4%) in children (<15 years), but not in adults (0.64% vs. 0.58%). A 2-year RSV-A dominance followed by a 1-year RSV-B dominance pattern was found. The co-detection rate of RSV was 25.1%. The main prevalent genotypes were NA1, ON1, and BA9. The prevalent RSV-A genotype in 2011–2012 was NA1, close to Chongqing and Brazil, but a new Hong Kong ON1 genotype was introduced and became the prevalent genotype in Guangzhou in 2014–2015. Deduced amino acid sequence analysis confirmed the ongoing evolution and a high selection pressure of RSV-A and B strains, especially in RSV-A ON1 and NA1 genotypes.
Conclusions
This study demonstrated the molecular epidemiological characteristics of RSV in patients with respiratory infections in southern China."

HIV-1 heterosexual transmission among individuals on antiretroviral treatment (ART) with undetectable viremia is extremely rare. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of sexual HIV-1 transmission and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in HIV-1 serodifferent couples while the index partner is on ART.
Methods
HIV transmission was evaluated in 200 HIV-1 heterosexual serodifferent couples in a stable relationship (≥3 months). All HIV-positive individuals had been on ART for ≥3 months and had been followed up for a median preceding time of 4.5 years (range 0.3–16 years) at the HIV couples clinic at Hospital Nossa Senhora da Conceição in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Following written informed consent, participants responded to demographic/behavioral questionnaires. Quantitative PCR for HIV RNA, T-cell subsets, and STI testing (syphilis, herpes, human papillomavirus, gonorrhea, and bacterial vaginosis) were performed. Self-collected vaginal swabs were obtained for quantitative HIV genital viral load testing.
Results
Among 200 couples, 70% of index partners were female. Five seroconversions were observed; the HIV infection incidence was 2.5% (95% confidence interval 0.8% to 5.7%). Mean plasma viral load results were higher in HIV transmitters compared to non-transmitters (p=0.02). The presence of STIs was significantly greater in couples who seroconverted (60.0% vs. 13.3%; odds ratio 9.75, 95% confidence interval 1.55–61.2; p=0.023). The duration of undetectable HIV viremia and presence of STIs were associated with HIV transmission.

Q fever endocarditis (QFE) is considered rare in the Middle East, with only a few cases reported in Saudi Arabia. The aim of this study is to report on the experience of our centre on QFE.
Methods
We searched the medical records for cases of QFE at our cardiac center from 2009–2018. Demographic data, clinical features, serology and echocardiography results, treatments, and outcomes were assessed.
Results
Five hundred and two cases of infective endocarditis were detected over the 10 years period. Among the 234 patients with blood culture-negative endocarditis (BCNE), 19 (8.10%) had QFE. All patients had a previously diagnosed congenital heart disease except for one patient with rheumatic heart disease. Eleven patients had received a bovine jugular vein-related implant, e.g., a Melody valve (seven patients) or Contegra conduit (four patients). Coinfection was detected in three patients, and immunologic and embolic phenomena were observed in five patients. All patients received a combination of hydroxychloroquine and doxycycline, with good outcomes. Only two patients required surgery while on treatment. Two patients died several months after treatment; the cause of death was not identified.
Conclusion
This study indicates that Q fever exists in our population. The majority of the patients had congenital heart disease (CHD) and underwent bovine jugular vein implants. Patients with CHD are at increased risk of infective endocarditis. Bovine jugular vein implants increase the risk of infective and possibly QFE. Proper exclusion of Q fever is warranted in all BCNE and possibly in culture-positive endocarditis cases in areas endemic to Q fever.
Key points
We presented the largest series of Q fever endocarditis cases in Saudi Arabia. We showed that Q fever is not rare in the Middle East and suggest that it should be considered in all blood culture-negative endocarditis cases."

Antibiotic use drives the development and spread of resistant bacterial infections. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become a prolific global issue, due to significant increases in antibiotic use in humans, livestock and agriculture, inappropriate use (under-dosing and over-prescribing), and misuse of antibiotics (for viral infections where they are ineffective). Fewer new antibiotics are being developed.
The problem of AMR
AMR is now considered a key threat to global health, leading to more mortality and increased healthcare costs threatening future conduct of routine medical procedures. Traditional approaches to address AMR include antibiotic stewardship, better hygiene/infection control, promoting antibiotic research and development, and restricting use for agricultural purposes.
Vaccines as a tool to reduce AMR
While antibiotic development is declining, vaccine technology is growing. This review shows how vaccines can decrease AMR by preventing bacterial and viral infections, thereby reducing the use/misuse of antibiotics, and by preventing antibiotic-resistant infections. Vaccines are less likely to induce resistance. Some future uses and developments of vaccines are also discussed.
Conclusions
Vaccines, along with other approaches, can help reduce AMR by preventing (resistant) infections and reducing antibiotic use. Industry and governments must focus on the development of novel vaccines and drugs against resistant infections to successfully reduce AMR. A graphical abstract is available online."

This study examined the epidemiological, clinical, and immunological characteristics of the 2015 dengue outbreak in Taiwan.
Methods
Clinical data were collected from dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) patients. A phylogenetic tree was used to analyze the source of the outbreak strain. Paired plasma samples from DF/DHF patients were used for antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) assay and cytokine multiplex biometric immunoassay to validate the immunological mechanism.
Results
This outbreak mainly occurred in two of the southern cities of Taiwan: Tainan (n=22 777; 52%) and Kaohsiung (n=19 784; 45%). A high DHF death rate was noted (34.6%). The case (DHF) and control (DF) study indicated that older age (>60 years), type II diabetes, and hypertension were risk factors correlated with the development of DHF (p< 0.0001). The phylogenetic tree results suggested that the outbreak-associated strain was dengue virus serotype 2 and cosmopolitan genotype, forming a stable cluster with the isolates from Thailand and Indonesia (bootstrap value of 99%). Cytokine analyses demonstrated that levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-4, IL-13, IL-1β, interferon gamma (IFN-γ), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were significantly higher in DHF patients compared to DF patients (p< 0.001). The ADE assay showed that diluted plasma containing preexisting dengue antibodies from DHF patients significantly enhanced dengue infection (p< 0.05).
Conclusion
The results suggest that older age, type II diabetes, hypertension, immunological cytokine dysregulation, and preexisting dengue antibodies inducing ADE infection are correlated with dengue severity. This study also indicates that the largest dengue outbreak in Taiwan might have been a result of imported DF from dengue epidemic regions."

abstract = "Background
Artesunate (ART) is an artemisinin derivative used as monotherapy for the treatment of severe malaria and in combination with a partner drug for non-severe malaria. Resistance of malaria parasites to artemisinins have emerged in Southeast Asia. Adjustment of drug regimen may be an option to prevent therapeutic failures considering the relative favourable safety profile of ART high doses.
Methods
For that purpose, a systematic review was done using PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases. All studies on ART and DHA pharmacokinetic post-administration of artesunate in human patients or volunteers were included. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist 2009 was used.
Findings
Fifty studies exploring oral, intravenous, rectal, and intramuscular route (1470 persons, volunteers and patients) were included. Correlations between artesunate doses and Cmax or AUC0-∞ of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and DHA+ART were evaluated. This correlation was good (R2>0.9) using intravenous (IV) route. DHA and ART+DHA average concentrations (Cav) were well above estimated in vivo half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) for intravenous route, but this was not the case for oral route.
Interpretation
The favorable Cav/EC50 ratio for IV route provides evidence that IV ART will remain efficient even in the case of increased resistance level, whereas for the oral route, a two-fold increase in EC50 may lead to therapeutic failures, thus providing a rationale for oral dose escalation. Considering the inter-individual variability of ART pharmacokinetic, Therapeutic Drug Monitoring through antimalarial stewardship activities is needed to optimize drug exposure and avoid resistance development."

While death due to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has been described, reports of fatal cases have been infrequent and no systematic reviews on the subject have been published.
Methods
A systematic review of the literature in four databases was performed to assess fatal outcomes of postnatal ZIKV infection and the available evidence that links ZIKV infection to death.
Results
Three hundred and eleven articles were retrieved; 20 of them were epidemiological reports from surveillance agencies and ministries of health. After screening by abstract and title, 59 articles were selected for full-text assessment. Of these, 35 were excluded (with reasons) and 24 were finally included for qualitative analysis. A total of 51 reported deaths associated with ZIKV infection in nine countries were identified. The majority of cases (56.9%) were not related to Guillain–Barré syndrome. Cases from three countries accounted for 67.6% of the deaths. ZIKV infection was laboratory-confirmed in the majority of cases (64.7%).
Discussion
ZIKV was not considered to be a dangerous, and much less a lethal pathogen, until very recently. However, an increasing number of fatalities have been published in the literature since the first death was reported in 2016. Additional research is needed to elucidate factors that may mediate the pathogenesis of severe, atypical, and fatal disease."

Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, caused by a large number of viral and bacterial agents. PARV4 is a recently identified virus detected in human blood and variety of tissues, but its disease association with SARI could not be established.
Objective
In the present case control study, we aim to investigate the association of PARV4 with SARI.
Methods
The Nasal and Throat swab (NS/TS) samples of 241 cases and 146 healthy controls were tested for most common respiratory viruses and PARV4 by real-time PCR.
Results
PARV4 was detected in 64(26.55%) SARI cases and only one healthy control (0.68%). PARV4 was the most common viral agent detected in SARI cases. A strong association of PARV4 is seen with severe respiratory illness.
Conclusion
Detection of PARV4 in a significantly higher number of SARI cases, in comparison with controls, suggests association of PARV4 with SARI. PARV4 genotype 2 is the only circulating strain detected in our study."

Methods
We retrospectively reviewed HIV-negative patients with PJP diagnosed in our department, who were treated with combination therapy of caspofungin and TMP/SMZ or monotherapy of TMP/SMZ during a six and a half year period.
Results
A total of 126 moderate to severe PJP patients were enrolled in the study. In the multivariate analysis, low lymphocyte counts, high serum lactate dehydrogenase levels at the diagnosis of PJP and progression to shock were significant risk factors for death. In all patients, there was no significant difference in risk of death at 3 months. In the group of BDG≥800pg/m, patients receiving combination therapy was associated with a significantly decreased risk of death at 3 months, whereas in the group of BDG<800pg/ml, there were no statistically significant difference in survival rate between the two treatment regimens.
Conclusion
High initial plasma (1, 3) Beta-d-Glucan concentration may be a predictor of satisfactory caspofungin response to HIV-negative patients with PJP. Based on our findings, we suggest the choice of combination therapy with caspofungin and TMP/SMZ as the initial treatment when BDG≥800pg/ml in moderate to severe HIV-negative patients with PJP."

abstract = "Objective
The 2009 province-wide and 2010 nationwide supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) greatly reduced measles prevalence in Guangdong, a province in southern China with the largest migrant population. However, during 2013–2014, Guangdong experienced a resurgence of the measles epidemic. This study was performed to examine the association between infections in migrants and the resurgence of the measles epidemic.
Methods
The records of 22 362 clinically and laboratory-confirmed measles cases from the years 2009 to 2014 were extracted from the National Infectious Disease Monitoring Information System. The epidemiological characteristics of infections in migrants during 2009–2012 were compared to those during 2013–2014.
Results
Infections in migrants were not significantly associated with the resurgence of the measles epidemic in 2013–2014 (p=0.98). Nevertheless, for infections among locals and migrants during 2009–2012 and 2013–2014, substantial increases in the proportion of infection were detected among children aged <8 months and the unvaccinated population (p<0.01).
Conclusions
The study findings suggest that infections in migrants might not have been the major cause of the epidemic resurgence of measles. Instead, the resurgence was likely due to infections among children aged <8 months and the unvaccinated. Thus, officials are advised to give higher priority to appropriate populations when formulating control measures, and to strengthen routine surveillance of vaccination coverage among them."

Severe cases of primary HIV infection have been described in patients presenting with neurological involvement, AIDS defining events or other life-threatening events. These severe forms have not been fully studied.
Objectives
To determine the prevalence and characteristics of severe PHI in a hospital-based cohort of primary HIV infection, and the response to the early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) at 12 months.
Methods
Every patient with PHI attending Hospital Clínic of Barcelona (1997–2015) was evaluated. Severe PHI was defined using clinical, analytical and immunological criteria. Chi-squared test was used for categorical variables and Student’s t-test for quantitative variables.
Results
33% of 224 PHI patients (95% CI: 26.84%–39.16%) had a severe PHI. These patients had more symptoms, abnormal analytical parameters and hospital admissions. The severe PHI group had a significantly higher viral load although no differences were observed at 12 months in terms of viral suppression or CD4 count recovery. None died during PHI.
Conclusions
Up to one third of patients in our cohort presented with a severe PHI, which was associated with higher hospitalization rates and higher plasma HIV RNA viral load. However, severe forms were not associated to a worse clinical, immunological or virological outcome at 12 months."

Tuberculosis (TB) is a critical global public threat, and limited epidemiology studies have been performed to explore the efficacy of active TB screening.
Methods
Three sites located in eastern China were chosen in 2013, and three rounds of systematic screenings were performed in permanent residents aged older than 15 years.
Results
The TB incidence showed a downtrend after several rounds of active screening at the three sites, and a significant change was observed at site A in the overall population. In the target population at sites A and B, both the elderly and people with a history of TB had a remarkable decline through the first or second round of screening. The implementation of active case-finding identified 2.36 [1.47,3.81] (2013 vs. 2012) and 1.49 [1.1,2.03] (2013–2015 vs. 2010–2012) more potential cases than the passive case-finding by the surveillance system at site A.
Conclusions
Active case-finding of tuberculosis might be effective in high prevalence area with a low economic level, particularly among the elderly and people with a history of TB. Additionally, new rapid diagnosis technology should be considered to decrease the prevalence among people with a history of TB. Ultimately, active screening identified more active TB cases than passive case-finding, particularly in high prevalence area with underdeveloped economics."

The re-engineered Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra) assay was developed due to the poor sensitivity of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the detection of tuberculosis (TB) in some conditions. This new assay has been recommended by the World Health Organization since 2017. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to assess the accuracy of Xpert Ultra for the detection of TB and rifampicin (RIF) resistance.
Methods
The Medline (via PubMed), Embase (via OvidSP), ISI Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Scopus databases were screened for original articles. Summary sensitivity and specificity were calculated with a bivariate mixed-effects model. A Fagan nomogram was used to assess the clinical utility. The sources of heterogeneity were investigated by meta-regression and subgroup analyses.
Results
Sixteen studies were identified. The summary diagnostic accuracy of Xpert Ultra for the diagnosis of TB were as follows: sensitivity 87.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) 82.5–90.8%) and specificity 96.5% (95% CI 95.1–97.5%). For the detection of RIF resistance, sensitivity was 95.1% (95% CI 91.6–97.2%) and specificity was 98.9% (95% CI 97.6–99.5%). Meta-regression showed that the category of population, TB prevalence, reference standard, sample state, sample type, and study design attributed to the heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses found good performance of Xpert Ultra in settings with a low TB burden.
Conclusions
As a rapid and highly sensitive test for the detection of TB and simultaneous detection of RIF resistance, Xpert Ultra exhibits a viable alternative in sensitivities in both pulmonary TB (PTB) and extrapulmonary TB (EPTB), which was proved to be higher than Xpert in the comparative analysis, and also shows a good performance in the detection of RIF resistance. Additional studies with comparative consistency tests are needed to precisely describe this finding for more forms of EPTB."

Rotavirus is the major cause of severe diarrhea in young children worldwide. In countries like Croatia, where rotavirus vaccine has not been introduced in the national immunization program, prospective surveillance is necessary to establish the diversity of rotavirus strains. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence and geographical distribution of rotavirus strains in Croatia and to detect the possible emergence of novel strains.
Methods
The study was conducted among children ≤5 years of age with acute gastroenteritis at three hospitals located in different geographical regions of Croatia, during the years 2012 to 2014. Rotavirus was detected in stools using an immunochromatographic assay and then sent for further molecular analysis.
Results
Genotyping of 822 rotaviruses showed that the predominant circulating strain was G1P[8] (61.9%), followed by G2P[4] (19.5%), G1P[4] (3.9%), and G3P[8] (2.9%). A high prevalence of reassortants among common human rotavirus genotypes was detected (7.7%). Possible zoonotic reassortants were found, including G8 and G6 strains. The latter is described for the first time in Croatia.
Conclusions
This study represents pre-vaccination data that are important for decisions regarding immunization strategies in Croatia. The high prevalence of ‘common’ rotavirus strains circulating in Croatia may advocate for rotavirus vaccine introduction, but further surveillance is necessary to monitor the possible emergence of novel genotypes."

Objectives
This paper aims to anticipate the technologies that might be relevant for prevention and vector control of arboviral diseases in the future.
Methods
A web-based survey was conducted of over 2,000 experts from all over the world. Both the technologies and the respondents were identified from recent scientific publications on arboviral diseases indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection.
Results
Our results show that within 20 years the enveloped virus-like particles-based vaccine and the gene-edited mosquitoes through CRISPR/Cas9 will likely be the most promising technologies for, respectively, prevention and vector control of arboviral diseases.
Conclusions
If these expectations are confirmed, these new technologies, when fully developed, may support global public health efforts aimed at reducing transmission, mortality and morbidity of arboviral diseases."

Syria’s protracted conflict has resulted in ideal conditions for the transmission of tuberculosis (TB) and the cultivation of drug-resistant strains. This paper compares TB control in Syria before and after the conflict using available data, examines the barriers posed by protracted conflict and those specific to Syria, and discusses what measures can be taken to address the control of TB in Syria.
Results
Forced mass displacement and systematic violations of humanitarian law have resulted in overcrowding and the destruction of key infrastructure, leading to an increased risk of both drug-sensitive and resistant TB, while restricting the ability to diagnose, trace contacts, treat, and follow-up. Pre-conflict, TB in Syria was officially reported at 22 per 100 000 population; the official figure for 2017 of 19 per 100 000 is likely a vast underestimate given the challenges and barriers to case detection. Limited diagnostics also affect the diagnosis of multidrug- and rifampicin-resistant TB, reported as comprising 8.8% of new diagnoses in 2017.
Conclusions
The control of TB in Syria requires a multipronged, tailored, and pragmatic approach to improve timely diagnosis, increase detection, stop transmission, and mitigate the risk of drug resistance. Solutions must also consider vulnerable populations such as imprisoned and besieged communities where the risk of drug resistance is particularly high, and must recognize the limitations of national programming. Strengthening capacity to control TB in Syria with particular attention to these factors will positively impact other parallel conditions; this is key as attention turns to post-conflict reconstruction."

abstract = "Objectives
It remains uncertain which catheter lock solution (CLS) to prevent catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) works best and is safest for patients. This study was performed to compare the efficacy of different CLSs for the prevention of CRBSI and ranked these CLSs for practical consideration.
Methods
The PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and MEDLINE databases, earlier relevant meta-analyses, and the reference lists of included studies were searched. The primary outcome was CRBSI; secondary outcomes were catheter-related thrombosis and exit-site infections. A network meta-analysis was performed to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Results
A total of 52 randomized controlled trials involving 9099 patients and evaluating 13 CLSs (single and combinations) were included. With regard to the quality of the evidence, the risk of bias was typically low or unclear (45 out of 52 trials, 86.5%). In the network meta-analysis, saline (OR 8.44, 95% CI 2.19–32.46), gentamicin+citrate (OR 2.92, 95% CI 1.32–6.42), ethanol (OR 5.33, 95% CI 1.22–23.32), and cloxacillin+heparin (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.19–5.49) were associated with a greater effect on CRBSI than heparin.
Conclusions
This network meta-analysis showed that minocycline–ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) seemed to be the most effective for the prevention of CRBSI and exit-site infection, and cefotaxime+heparin seemed to be the most effective for catheter-related thrombosis."

abstract = "Background
Previous animal studies have shown that certain respiratory oncoviruses can lead to tumorigenesis, especially influenza virus. However, no clinical studies other than animal studies have been conducted to test this hypothesis.
Objective
To investigate the association between influenza and the risk of lung cancer using the Taiwan Cancer Registry Database (TCRD) and Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD).
Methods
We identified a study cohort consisting of patients aged 40 years or above who were enrolled in the NHIRD between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2014. Among them, we identified patients with lung cancer (cases) and their matched controls (matched by age, sex, and disease risk score (DRS) at a ratio of 1:10). Multivariate conditional logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between exposure to influenza (timing and cumulative number) and risk of lung cancer.
Results
We identified 32,063 cases and 320,627 matched controls. Influenza was associated with a 1.09-fold increased risk of lung cancer (aOR 1.09, 95% CI 1.04–1.14, p<0.0001). The risk of lung cancer increased slightly with cumulative exposure to influenza (1–2 exposures: aOR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00–1.11; 3-4 exposures: aOR 1.12, 95% CI 1.00–1.25; 5+ exposures: aOR 1.25, 95% CI 1.13–1.39).
Conclusion
Exposure to influenza was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer and the risk increased with cumulative exposure to influenza. However, the lack of valid information on smoking could lead to confounding, and future studies collecting patients’ smoking histories are warranted to validate the association between influenza and lung cancer."

Limited data on healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are available from the developing world, thus a point prevalence survey was conducted to determine the prevalence of HAIs and antimicrobial use in Guangdong Province, China.
Methods
A standardized methodology for point prevalence surveys on HAIs and antimicrobial use has been developed by the Chinese Nosocomial Infection Control and Quality Improvement Center. The prevalence of HAIs, antimicrobial use, and baseline hospital-level variables were collected in 189 hospitals from June 2017 to May 2018.
Results
Of 5 868 147 patients, 72 976 had one or more HAIs (1.24%), with 82 700 distinct HAIs. The prevalence rates of device-associated infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, catheter-associated urinary tract infection, and central line-associated bloodstream infection were 7.92, 2.06, and 0.63 per 1000 catheter-days, respectively. A total of 10 591 (0.18%) HAIs caused by multidrug-resistant organisms were identified. Carbapenem non-susceptibility rates were highest in Acinetobacter species (53.86%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.60%). Forty-six percent (2 712 258/5 868 147) of inpatients were receiving at least one antimicrobial during this survey.
Conclusions
This survey indicated the relatively lower prevalence of HAIs but higher antimicrobial using in Guangdong Province compared with other mid to low-income and high-income countries. Further studies are warranted to elucidate which HAI-related indicators are the best measures of HAI performance and thus allow improvements leading to better patient outcomes."

To evaluate the performance of rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDT) and influenza vaccines’ effectiveness (VE) during an outbreak setting.
Methods
We compared the performance of a RIDT with RT-PCR for influenza virus detection in influenza-like illness (ILI) patients enrolled during the 2016/17 season in Mexico City. Using the test-negative design, we estimated influenza VE in all participants and stratified by age, virus subtype, and vaccine type (trivalent vs quadrivalent inactivated vaccines). The protective value of some clinical variables was evaluated by regression analyses.
Results
We enrolled 592 patients. RT-PCR detected 93 cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 55 of AH3N2, 141 of B, and 13 A/B virus infections. RIDT showed 90.7% sensitivity and 95.7% specificity for influenza A virus detection, and 91.5% sensitivity and 95.3% specificity for influenza B virus detection. Overall VE was 33.2% (95% CI: 3.0–54.0; p = 0.02) against any laboratory-confirmed influenza infection. VE estimates against influenza B were higher for the quadrivalent vaccine. Immunization and occupational exposure were protective factors against influenza.
Conclusions
The RIDT was useful to detect influenza cases during an outbreak setting. Effectiveness of 2016/17 influenza vaccines administered in Mexico was low but significant. Our data should be considered for future local epidemiological policies."

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of colistin resistance and other predictors on fatality among patients with Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infections (Kp-BSI) and to describe the effect of amikacin and tigecycline on the outcome in an OXA-48 dominant country.
Method
This was a retrospective study performed among patients >16 years of age in a tertiary hospital with 465 beds. All cases had ≥1 positive blood culture for K. pneumoniae 48 h after admission.
Results
Among 210 patients with Kp-BSI, the 30-day mortality rate after isolation of the microorganism was 58%. The rate of carbapenem resistance was higher (64% vs. 38%, p < 0.001) and the colistin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was elevated (7 vs. 4, p < 0.029) among the patients who died. Among the colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae, the rates of OXA-48, ST101, and NDM-1 were 78%, 67%, and 35%, respectively. Amikacin was added to the treatment of 13 patients with carbapenem and colistin-resistant Kp-BSI and 77% survived (p < 0.001). Tigecycline was added to the treatment of 24 patients with carbapenem and colistin-resistant Kp-BSI, and the 30-day mortality rate was 71% (p = 0.576). In the multivariate analysis, carbapenem resistance (odds ratio (OR) 5.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.47–10.9, p < 0.001) and increasing APACHE II score (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.12–1.26, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with 30-day mortality. The addition of amikacin to the treatment regimen (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01–0.23, p < 0.001) was significantly beneficial.
Conclusions
Carbapenem resistance, increasing MIC of colistin, and the lungs as the source of the infection were significantly associated with 30-day mortality. The empirical use of combined active aminoglycosides was found to be beneficial in the treatment of colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae infections."

Eight additional provinces in western China reported human infections for the first time during the fifth wave of human H7N9 infections. The aim of this study was to analyze the epidemiological and virological characteristics of this outbreak.
Methods
The epidemiological data of H7N9 cases from the newly affected western Chinese provinces were collected and analyzed. Full-length genome sequences of H7N9 virus were downloaded from the GenBank and GISAID databases, and phylogenetic, genotyping, and genetic analyses were conducted.
Results
The peak of human infections in the newly affected western Chinese provinces was delayed by 4 months compared to the eastern Chinese provinces, and both low pathogenic (LP) and highly pathogenic (HP) H7N9-infected cases were found. The LP- and HP-H7N9 virus belonged to 10 different genotypes (including four new genotypes), of which G11 and G3 were the dominant genotypes, respectively. Almost all of these viruses originated from eastern and southern China and were most probably imported from neighboring provinces. Genetic characteristics of the circulating viruses were similar to those of the viruses from previously affected provinces during Wave Five.
Conclusions
A delayed peak of human infections was observed in the newly affected western Chinese provinces, and reassortment has been ongoing since the introduction of H7N9 viruses. This study highlights the importance of continued surveillance of the circulation and evolution of H7N9 virus in western China."

We measured seroconversion to influenza viruses and incidence of symptomatic influenza virus infection in a cohort of children in Bangkok, Thailand.
Methods
Children aged ≤6 months were followed for two years for acute respiratory illness (ARI) and had serum specimens taken at 6-month intervals and tested by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. Seroconversion was defined as a >4-fold rise in the HI titers between time points with a titer of >40 in the second specimen. Respiratory swabs were tested by rRT-PCR for influenza. Data were analyzed using generalized linear models.
Results
Of 350 children, 266 (76%, 147 were healthy and 119 were high-risk) had ≥2 serum specimens collected before influenza vaccination. During the 2-year follow-up, 266 children contributed 370 person-years of observation, excluding post-vaccination periods. We identified 32 ARI cases with rRT-PCR-confirmed influenza virus infection (7 infections/100 person-years, 95% confidence interval [CI], 4–11). There were 126 episodes of influenza virus infection, resulting in a seroconversion rate of 35 infections/100 person-years (95% CI, 30–42). Rates in healthy and high-risk children did not differ.
Conclusions
Influenza virus infection is common during the first two years of life among Thai children. A large proportion of infections may not be detected using the ARI case definition."

This study compared the genomes of influenza viruses that caused mild infections among outpatients and severe infections among hospitalized patients in Singapore, and characterized their molecular evolution and receptor-binding specificity.
Methods
The complete genomes of influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B viruses that caused mild infections among outpatients and severe infections among inpatients in Singapore during 2012–2015 were sequenced and characterized. Using various bioinformatics approaches, we elucidated their evolutionary, mutational and structural patterns against the background of global and vaccine strains.
Results
The phylogenetic trees of the 8 gene segments revealed that the outpatient and inpatient strains overlapped with representative global and vaccine strains. We observed a cluster of inpatients with A/H3N2 strains that were closely related to vaccine strain A/Texas/50/2012(H3N2). Several protein sites could accurately discriminate between outpatient versus inpatient strains, with site 221 in neuraminidase (NA) achieving the highest accuracy for A/H3N2. Interestingly, amino acid residues of inpatient but not outpatient isolates at those sites generally matched the corresponding residues in vaccine strains, except at site 145 of hemagglutinin (HA). This would be especially relevant for future surveillance of A/H3N2 strains in relation to their antigenicity and virulence. Furthermore, we observed a trend in which the HA proteins of influenza A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 exhibited enhanced ability to bind both avian and human host cell receptors. In contrast, the binding ability to each receptor was relatively stable for the HA of influenza B.
Conclusions
Overall, our findings extend our understanding of the molecular and structural evolution of influenza virus strains in Singapore within the global context of these dynamic viruses."

Methods
We constructed a distributed-lag nonlinear model (DLNM) to evaluate the relatively long-term influence of outdoor PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and NO2 exposure on active TB risk in the city of Lianyungang in Jiangsu Province, China.
Results
There were 7,282 TB cases reported in the study area during 2014–2017, with annual median (interquartile range) concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and NO2 at 45.86 (34.57–64.14) μg/m3, 85.43 (62.86–116.14) μg/m3, 22.00 (15.71–30.86) μg/m3 and 30.00 (23.29–38.57) μg/m3, respectively. The single-pollutant model showed that for each 10 μg/m3 increase in concentration, the cumulative relative risk of TB was 1.12 (lag 0–24 weeks, 95% CI: 1.03–1.22) for PM2.5 with reference to 35 μg/m3; 1.11 (lag 0–21 weeks, 95% CI: 1.06–1.17) for PM10 with reference to 70 μg/m3; 1.37 (lag 0–20 weeks, 95% CI: 1.16–1.62) for SO2 with reference to 60 μg/m3; and 1.29 (lag 0–22 weeks, 95% CI: 1.11–1.49) for NO2 with reference to 40 μg/m3. In the multipollutant model considering both PM10 and NO2, the association remained significant.
Conclusions
Our results revealed a potential association between outdoor exposure to PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and NO2 and active TB. Considering that people from developing countries continue to be exposed to both severe outdoor air pollution and high rates of latent TB infection, the association between worsening air pollution and active TB deserves further attention."

Mycobacterium bovis BCG is a live, attenuated tuberculosis vaccine. While the vaccine protects infants from tuberculosis, complications including disseminated infections have been reported following vaccination. Genetically diverse BCG sub-strains now exist following continuous passaging of the original Pasteur strain for vaccine manufacture. This genetic diversity reportedly influences the severity of disseminated BCG infections and the efficacy of BCG immunization.
Methods
M. bovis BCG was isolated from infants suspected of being infected with tuberculosis. The whole genome of the clinical isolates and BCG Moscow were sequenced using Illumina Miseq and the sequences were analysed using CLC Genomics Workbench 7.0, PhyResSE v1.0, and Parsnp.
Results and conclusions
Genetic variations between the clinical strains and the reference BCG Copenhagen were identified. The clinical strains shared only one mutation in a secretion protein. Mutations were identified in various antibiotic resistance genes in the BCG isolates, which suggests their potential as multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotypes. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the two isolates were distantly related, and the M1_S48 clinical isolate was closely related to M. bovis BCG Moscow. The phylogenomics results imply that two different BCG strains may be circulating in South Africa. However, it is difficult to associate the BCG vaccine strain administered and the BCG strain supplied with specific adverse events, as BCGiosis is under-reported. This study presents background genomic information for future surveillance and tracking of the distribution of BCGiosis-associated mycobacteria. It is also the first to report on the genomes of clinical BCG strains in Africa."

abstract = "Objectives
Relebactam is a small molecule β-lactamase inhibitor under clinical investigation for use as a fixed-dose combination with imipenem/cilastatin. Here we present a translational pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic mathematical model to support optimal dose selection of relebactam.
Methods
Data derived from in vitro checkerboard and hollow fiber infection studies of imipenem-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were incorporated into the model. The model integrates the effect of relebactam concentration on imipenem susceptibility in a semi-mechanistic manner using the checkerboard data and characterizes the bacterial time-kill profiles from the hollow fiber infection model data.
Results
Simulations demonstrated that the ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve for free drug to the minimum inhibitory concentration (fAUC/MIC) was the pharmacokinetic driver for relebactam, with a target fAUC/MIC=7.5 associated with 2-log kill. At a clinical dose of 250mg relebactam, greater than 2-log reductions in bacterial load are projected for imipenem-resistant strains with an imipenem/relebactam MIC≤4μg/mL.
Conclusions
The study confirms that the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic driver for relebactam is fAUC/MIC, that an fAUC/MIC ratio of 7.5 is associated with 2-log kill in vitro, and that a 250mg clinical dose of relebactam achieves this target value when delivered in combination with imipenem/cilastatin."

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) may pose a serious threat to immunocompromised patients (IMC). Herein, we evaluated the clinical outcomes of IMC patients with CDI.
Methods
All consecutive hospitalized patients between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2018 with laboratory confirmed CDI were included in the study. Subjects were divided into two groups: IMC patients and controls. Primary outcome was the recurrence rate of CDI (rCDI) at 30 and 90 days after the first CDI episode. Secondary outcomes included 30 and 90 day all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay (LOS) and readmission rates. A multivariate analysis adjusted other risk factors for recurrence. An analysis of IMC patient subgroups (based on type of IMC conditions) was also performed. Results are reported as odds ratios (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI).
Results
A total of 573 patients were included, amongst them 149 IMC patients (36 solid organ transplants, 38 undergoing chemotherapy, 62 haematological conditions, 13 receiving high dose prednisone) and 424 controls. IMC patients were younger, independent and exhibited less significant comorbidities. On multivariable analysis, the rate of rCDI was significantly higher in IMC patients (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.6–5). rCDI was also associated with vancomycin therapy, haemodialysis and previous hospitalizations. Mortality, LOS, CDI complications and rehospitalization rates were similar in both.
Conclusions
IMC patients with CDI have an increased risk of 90 days rCDI. Vancomycin treatment for CDI endangers recurrence in IMC patients. Further research should explore other therapies for IMC patients with CDI with alternative agents such as Fidaxomicin and Bezlotoxumab."

Results
Among 278 participants, 63.7% (95% CI: 58.0–69.3) were considered susceptible to HBV infection. The prevalence rate of HBV exposure was 10.1% (95% CI: 6.5–13.6) and 0.4% (95% CI: 0.1–0.6) were chronic carriers. Age ≥45 years (AOR=7.15), history of homosexual contact (AOR=5.29), tattoo (AOR=4.92) and history of surgery (AOR=2.89) were factors associated with ever infection. Age 18–25 years (AOR=4.63), educational level ≥9 years (AOR=1.98) and knowledge about HBV transmission (AOR=3.08) were associated with serological HBV vaccination like profile (26.2%; 95% CI: 21.1–31.4).
Conclusions
Despite the availability and efficacy of HBV vaccine, this study found high HBV exposure and proportion of susceptible adults in a low endemic area. Vaccination and screening campaigns using accessible language to the economically disadvantaged populations can reduce the number of people susceptible to HBV infection."

Community Treatment Initiative (CTI) was developed in northern Nigeria as an intervention to link a cohort of people living with HIV (PLHIV) who refused antiretroviral treatment through a conventional linkage method to care and treatment. The CTI attempted to take treatment to PLHIV in the community.
Methods
This was a non-control interventional study that evaluated the proportion of linkage-resistant PLHIV linked to treatment through the CTI in nine geographical areas. Data were collected between October and December 2015. Linkage-resistant PLHIV were identified and linked to treatment using the CTI. Data were analyzed using Excel and IBM SPSS version 20.0. The simple proportion was used to estimate the linkage-resistant PLHIV who were eventually linked and retained in care and who ultimately achieved virological suppression (viral load <1000 copies/ml). The Chi-square test was used and the level of significance set at a p-value of <0.05.
Results
An estimated 541 (20%) PLHIV (239 (44.2%) male, 302 (55.8%) female) seen from October to December 2015 refused linkage to treatment. This was statistically significant at a p-value of <0.0001. Three hundred and seventy-seven (69.7%) of the PLHIV who refused linkage to treatment eventually accepted treatment using an alternative community treatment method; this was significant (p<0.0001). The 6-month retention rate for PLHIV who accepted the alternative treatment method was 88.1% (n=332); this was significant (p<0.0001). Seventy-eight percent of those retained in care attained virological suppression.
Conclusions
The CTI improved linkage to care and treatment for a cohort of linkage-resistant PLHIV. Focus on this cohort of linkage-resistant positive clients is required to achieve HIV epidemic control."

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to describe the results of a systematic serological screening programme for strongyloidiasis.
Methods
A prospective serological screening programme for strongyloidiasis was performed between 2009 and 2014 for all immigrant patients attending the Tropical Medicine Unit. Three formalin-ether concentrated stool samples and an ELISA for anti-Strongyloides stercoralis antibodies were used as screening tools.
Results
Of 659 patients screened, 79 (12%) were positive for S. stercoralis regardless of the diagnostic method used. The prevalence of infection was 42.9% in East African patients, 16.3% in Central African patients, 10.9% in those from South America, and 10% in the case of West Africa. Univariate analysis showed that infection by S. stercoralis was significantly more frequent in patients from Central Africa (p=0.026; OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.03–2.85) and East Africa (p<0.001; OR 5.88, 95% CI 1.75–19.32). Taking West Africa as the reference (as the area of lowest prevalence among the positive prevalence areas), the statistical analysis showed that the risk of infection was higher in East Africa (p=0.001; OR 6.750, 95% CI 2.127–21.423) and Central Africa (p=0.065; OR 1.747, 95% CI 0.965–3.163).
Conclusions
Due to the potential complications of strongyloidiasis infection, we recommend that immigrant patients from developing countries be routinely screened for S. stercoralis, especially those from East Africa. A serological test is a highly appropriate screening tool."

abstract = "Background
The 2003 invasion of Iraq significantly undermined population health. However, there is a lack of understanding of how it undermined communicable disease control. This study was performed to assess the incidence trends of 32 communicable diseases in post-conflict Iraq.
Methods
Reported incidence data for 32 communicable diseases (2004–2016) were collected from routine reports sent to the Iraqi Ministry of Health by primary health centers, and general and tertiary hospitals. Incidence (per 100 000) was defined as the number of reported incident cases divided by the population size. Joinpoint regression was used to examine the incidence trends and average annual percentage change (AAPC) for each disease, and the overall incidence rate across the period.
Results
Communicable diseases increased significantly during the peak years of the war, especially during the US troop surge period (2007–2009). As US troops withdrew (after 2011), overall communicable diseases decreased. The incidence rate of nearly half of the 32 diseases decreased significantly, while the incidence rate of five increased significantly (hepatitis A, varicella, viral meningitis, cutaneous leishmaniasis, extrapulmonary tuberculosis).
Conclusions
The early foundational strength of Iraq’s health system may help explain why infectious disease failed to overwhelm the population following the invasion. Iraq’s federal government could exercise its legal authority to manage threats to public health security by expanding the disease surveillance system."

Methods
A descriptive observational study using a cross-sectional design and consecutive sampling method was conducted from May to July 2018. The study was conducted in Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia and included 32 men affected by leprosy and five healthy men as a control group. All patients were subjected to history-taking, dermatological and genital examinations, assessment of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and testosterone, and testicular ultrasonography examination. Semen analysis was performed for the 10 patients who consented.
Results
Testicular atrophy was observed in 93.75% of patients. Clinical manifestations of testicular atrophy were loss of libido (21.87%), female pubic hair pattern (9.38%), gynecomastia (6.25%), and secondary infertility (6.25%). Hormonal imbalance was seen in 16 patients, and all 10 patients who underwent semen analysis showed an abnormality.

Methods
A systematic literature search was carried out in Medline, Scielo, Lilacs, and Cochrane Library. The search strategy aimed at retrieving studies focusing on RSV prevalence, burden, risk factors, and the routine clinical practice in the prevention and management of RSV infections in Latin American countries. Only articles published between January 2011 and December 2017 were considered.
Results
Eighteen studies were included. Percentages of RSV detection varied highly across included studies for adult subjects with respiratory infections (0% to 77.9%), influenza-like illness (1.0% to 16.4%) and community-acquired pneumonia (1.3% to 13.5%). Considerable percentages of hospitalization were reported for RSV-infected adults with influenza-like illness (40.9% and 69.9%) and community-acquired pneumonia (91.7%).
Conclusions
Recent RSV data regarding adult populations in Latin America are scarce. RSV was documented as a cause of illness in adults and the elderly, being identified in patients with acute respiratory infections, influenza-like illness and community-acquired pneumonia. The studies suggest that RSV infections may be a significant cause of hospitalization in adult populations in Latin America, including younger adults."

To assess the effectiveness of single-dose rifampicin (SDR) after bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination in preventing leprosy in contacts.
Methods
This was a single-centre, cluster-randomized controlled trial at a leprosy control programme in northwest Bangladesh. Participants were the 14988 contacts of 1552 new leprosy patients who were randomized into the SDR−arm (n=7379) and the SDR+arm (n=7609). In the intervention group, BCG vaccination was followed by SDR 8–12 weeks later. In the control group, BCG vaccination only was given. Follow-up was performed at 1year and 2 years after intake. The main outcome measure was the occurrence of leprosy.
Results
The incidence rate per 10000 person-years at risk was 44 in the SDR−arm and 31 in the SDR+arm at 1year; the incidence rate was 34 in the SDR−arm and 41 in the SDR+arm at 2 years. There was a statistically non-significant (p=0.148; 42%) reduction for paucibacillary (PB) leprosy in the SDR+ arm at 1 year. Of all new cases, 33.6% appeared within 8–12 weeks after BCG vaccination.
Conclusions
In the first year, SDR after BCG vaccination reduced the incidence of PB leprosy among contacts by 42%. This was a statistically non-significant reduction due to the limited number of cases after SDR was administered. To what extent SDR suppresses excess leprosy cases after BCG vaccination is difficult to establish because many cases appeared before the SDR intervention.

In December 2018, routine surveillance identified an autochthonous outbreak of dengue fever in Muscat Governorate, Oman, a region previously free of dengue fever.
Methods
Routine surveillance confirmed locally acquired cases in the second week of December, leading to a rapid public health response including case management guidance and epidemiological investigations. The main activity was the vector survey using systematic sampling to assess extent of previously unreported Aedes aegypti presence followed by a campaign aimed to eliminate breeding sites of A. aegypti”.
Results
During a 5-month period, 343 suspected cases were reported from Muscat Governorate with 122 from the outbreak affected area. Out of 207 probable cases eligible for laboratory testing as per guidelines issued, 59 cases were confirmed. The vector elimination campaign started on January 8, 2019 after a media advocacy using television and social media and concluded on January 23. By the end of campaign, the case load had decreased significantly in the affected area with no reports of locally acquired cases from adjoining areas of Muscat Governorate, indicating no further spread.
Conclusions
Rapid notification and early community-wide, extensive vector control activities effectively contained the autochthonous dengue fever virus outbreak."

abstract = "Background
Achieving a high degree of diagnostic accuracy of infections in the emergency department (ED) is crucial since a delay in diagnosis can lead to increased mortality, whereas overdiagnosis can lead to antibiotic overprescription. Limited data are available as to ED diagnostic accuracy of infections. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the degree of discordance of an ED diagnosis of pneumonia in relation to an internal medicine ward’s discharge diagnosis of hospitalized adults.
Methods
We reviewed the records of all adults hospitalized in internal wards from November 2017-January 2018 diagnosed with an acute infection by an ED physician. The primary outcome was the discordance degree of an ED pneumonia diagnosis compared to the internal ward discharge diagnosis. The influence comorbidities and clinical characteristics on the diagnostic discordance were also evaluated.
Results
The study included 875 adults; 434 were admitted with an ED diagnosis of a specific infection. Pneumonia was the most frequent ED diagnosis (n = 195, 45%), of them, 56 (29%) were discordant diagnosis in the internal ward.
Conclusion
Interpretation of chest X-rays with the assistance of a radiologist might help in reducing overdiagnosis and minimize antibiotic overprescription, thus improving the ED diagnostic accuracy of pneumonia."

In 2014, this caused the World Health Organization to declare pertussis resurgent in some countries and led to recommendations regarding pertussis surveillance and national immunization programs. Despite the resurgence of pertussis, epidemiology of the disease in Southeast Asia has received little attention. In this narrative review, we describe pertussis surveillance systems, control measures, epidemiologic trends, and region-specific pertussis research in Southeast Asia.

Despite the considerable disease burden caused by the disease, rotavirus vaccine has not been introduced into routine national immunization schedule, and norovirus vaccines are being developed without a comprehensive understanding of gastroenteritis epidemiology. To bridge this knowledge gap, we investigated the disease burden of viral gastroenteritis in rural China.
Methods
Between October 2011 and December 2013, population-based surveillance was conducted in Zhengding and Sanjiang counties in China. Stool samples were collected from children <5 years of age with diarrhea. All specimens were tested for rotaviruses, noroviruses, sapoviruses, enteric adenoviruses, and astroviruses.
Results
The most common pathogen causing diarrhea was rotavirus (54.7 vs 45.6 cases/1,000 children/year in Zhengding and Sanjiang, respectively), followed by norovirus (28.4 vs 19.3 cases/1,000 children/year in Zhengding and Sanjiang, respectively). The highest incidence of these viruses was observed in children 6–18 months of age. Among the 5 viral pathogens, rotaviruses caused the most severe illness, followed by noroviruses.
Conclusion
Rotavirus and norovirus are the 2 most important viral pathogens causing childhood diarrhea in both northern and southern China; they should be the major targets for viral gastroenteritis prevention strategies among children in China."

To evaluate the epidemiological profile of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD), meningococcal meningitis, and Neisseria meningitidis carriers in Latin America.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted to identify and analyze studies published in 2008–2018. Incidence rates, case fatality rates (CFRs), and the relative distribution of cases per serogroup by country were assessed.
Results
Meningococcal surveillance in Latin America differs among countries, and most systems are based on passive sentinel surveillance. Thirty-nine studies were selected. In 2006, the incidence rate of IMD per 100 000 inhabitants was highest in Brazil (1.9), followed by Uruguay (1.3), Chile (0.8), Argentina (0.7), Colombia and Venezuela (0.3 each), and Mexico (0.06). Brazil reported the highest CFR (20%), followed by Uruguay (15%), Chile (11%), and Venezuela and Argentina (10% each). In 2012, the CFR in Chile increased to approximately 27%. The most frequent serogroups among IMD cases were C in Brazil (2007–2010) and Mexico (2005–2016), W in Chile (2012–2018), and B in Argentina (2012–2015). However, the true burden of IMD in Latin America is probably underestimated due to underreporting of cases.
Conclusions
Improvements in IMD notification, IMD registration, national surveillance programs (including active surveillance systems), diagnostic tools, and characterization of isolates may better elucidate the true epidemiological burden of IMD in Latin America."

Sri Lanka is a country where the molecular epidemiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is poorly explored. Therefore, this study was performed to identify circulating lineages/sub-lineages of MTB and their transmission patterns.
Methods
DNA was extracted from 89 isolates of MTB collected during 2012 and 2013 from new pulmonary tuberculosis patients in Kandy, Sri Lanka and analyzed by spoligotyping, large sequence polymorphism (LSP), mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit–variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing, and drug resistance-associated gene sequencing.
Results
The predominant lineage was lineage 4 (Euro-American, 45.9%), followed by lineage 1 (Indo-Oceanic, 29.4%), lineage 2 (East-Asian, 23.5%), and lineage 3 (Central-Asian, 1.2%). Among 26 spoligotype patterns, eight were undesignated or new types and seven of these belonged to lineage 4. Undesignated lineage 4/SIT124 (n=2/8) and SIT3234 (n=8/8) clustered together based on 24-locus MIRU-VNTR typing. The dominant sub-lineage was Beijing/SIT1 (n=19), with the isoniazid resistance katG G944C mutation (Ser315Thr) detected in two of them.
Conclusions
The population structure of MTB in Kandy, Sri Lanka was different from that in the South Asian region. The clonal expansion of locally evolved lineage 4/SIT3234 and detection of the pre-multidrug resistant Beijing isolates from new tuberculosis patients is alarming and will require continuous monitoring."

abstract = "Background
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotype 3 is endemic in Europe, and the infection is mostly subclinical or acute and self-limiting. However, persistent infection is described among HIV-infected individuals. The prevalence of antibodies against HEV (anti-HEV) among HIV-infected persons varies geographically and is unknown in Denmark. Rates of co-infection with HEV among HIV-infected individuals in Denmark over three decades, from the early 1980s to 2013, were investigated.
Methods
A total of 2506 HIV-infected persons were investigated from two cohorts followed at Hvidovre Hospital, Denmark. Blood samples were tested retrospectively for anti-HEV, including samples from 2216 persons who were enrolled in a prospective clinical cohort and followed between 1995 and 2013, as well as samples from 290 persons from a historical cohort followed between 1980 and 1994. For anti-HEV seroconverting individuals, serial samples were tested for HEV RNA. Factors associated with anti-HEV status were explored using multivariable logistic regression analysis.
Results
The overall HEV seroprevalence rates were stable during the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000–2013 (23.1%, 22.9%, and 23.7%, respectively). In all decades, rates of anti-HEV increased with older age, and anti-HEV seropositivity was associated with older generations, HIV risk group, and geographic origin. Persistent HEV infection was not detected in any of 57 individuals with anti-HEV seroconversion.
Conclusions
HEV seroprevalence rates were stable in HIV-infected individuals from the early 1980s to 2013. Rates increased with age. No evidence of persistent HEV infection was detected. Infection with HEV is frequent, but persistent HEV infection is rare among HIV-infected individuals."

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common medical complication experienced by patients with neurologic diseases. In this study, we established the microbial etiologies of UTI, and resistances to antibiotics in UTI as well as determining which appropriate empirical antibiotics should be used to treat UTI in neurological patients.
Designs and methods
We retrospectively reviewed microbial etiologies and antimicrobial resistance among patients experiencing UTI events in the neurology ward of Seoul National University Hospital from 2007 to 2016.
Results
The total number of UTI events observed was 301, and Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most common pathogen observed in UTIs. But in catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI), Enterococcus species were the most prevalent pathogens. Susceptibility to commonly-prescribed antibiotics decreased over 10 years, indicating increased antibiotic resistance in pathogens associated with UTI. ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae increased significantly, while increases of MDR K. pneumoniae, ESBL-producing E. coli, and VRE were not observed.
Conclusions
The worldwide trend of increasing drug-resistant pathogens should be considered, and further studies on antibiotics resistance in UTI are needed. These data will greatly assist physicians when they select antibiotics to treat UTIs in neurological patients."

In July 2018, recurrent hepatitis E cases were reported from a factory in Qingdao City, China. The aim of this study was to identify additional cases, and help prevent future incidents by identifying possible risk factors for infection.
Methods
Participants were asked to provide blood samples for hepatitis E virus (HEV) IgM and IgG antibodies screening, as well as liver function test. A questionnaire that assessed demographics, potential risk factors, and clinical symptoms was completed by participants. HEV RNA genotyping was performed using a nested Reverse Transcriptional Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) method. Adjusted Poisson regression model for participant characteristics and risk factors was constructed for multivariate analysis.
Results
Overall, 41(14.5%, 41/283) participants had recent acute infection (21 of these were symptomatic). The result of multivariate analysis demonstrated a significant association of acute HEV infection with consumption of pig liver within the past two months (Relative Risk 2.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10–6.17, p=0.0294). Sequencing of HEV RNA from seventeen acute cases indicated three HEV isolates of genotype 4 induced this outbreak.
Conclusions
This was probably a common-source foodborne hepatitis E outbreak, related to the consumption of undercooked pig liver."

No specific treatments for reducing mortality or morbidity are yet available. Deaths from COVID-19 will continue to rise globally until effective and appropriate treatments and/or vaccines are found. In search of effective treatments, the global medical, scientific, pharma and funding communities have rapidly initiated over 500 COVID-19 clinical trials on a range of antiviral drug regimens and repurposed drugs in various combinations. A paradigm shift is underway from the current focus of drug development targeting the pathogen, to advancing cellular Host-Directed Therapies (HDTs) for tackling the aberrant host immune and inflammatory responses which underlie the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and high COVID-19 mortality rates. We focus this editorial specifically on the background to, and the rationale for, the use and evaluation of mesenchymal stromal (Stem) cells (MSCs) in treatment trials of patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Currently, the ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) report a combined 28 trials exploring the potential of MSCs or their products for treatment of COVID-19. MSCs should also be trialed for treatment of other circulating WHO priority Blueprint pathogens such as MERS-CoV which causes upto 34% mortality rates. It’s about time funding agencies invested more into development MSCs per se, and also for a range of other HDTs, in combination with other therapeutic interventions. MSC therapy could turn out to be an important contribution to bringing an end to the high COVID-19 death rates and preventing long-term functional disability in those who survive disease."

abstract = "Objectives
The aim of this study was to assess the indirect effect of paediatric 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) vaccination on people ≥65 years of age with invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in Catalonia and to determine factors predictive of mortality.
Methods
During 2014–2016, 1285 IPD cases were reported to the Public Health Agency of Catalonia. The indirect effect of paediatric PCV13 vaccination was calculated by comparing the incidence rate (IR) in 2016 (PCV13 year) with that in 2009 (pre-PCV13). Predictors of mortality were determined using multivariate logistic regression.
Results
Comparing 2016 and 2009, IPD decreased by 19% (IR 40.1 and 32.5 per 100 000 person-years, respectively). PCV13 serotypes decreased by 57% (IR 23.7 and 10.1), while non-PCV13 serotypes increased by 36% (IR 16.4 and 22.4). During 2014–2016, the mortality rate was 17.5%, and mortality was associated with age ≥85 years (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.89, 4.48), meningitis (aOR 2.29, 95% CI 1.25, 4.19), non-focal bacteraemia (aOR 3.73, 95% CI 2.00, 6.94), and ≥1 high-risk condition (aOR 1.89, 95% CI 1.08, 3.32). PPV23non13 serotypes were associated with lower mortality than PCV13 serotypes (aOR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34, 0.86).
Conclusions
The incidence of IPD in people ≥65 years of age decreased after the introduction of paediatric PCV13, and this was due to a reduction in PCV13 serotypes, although an increase in non-PCV13 serotypes was observed. Mortality was associated with age, meningitis, non-focal bacteraemia, ≥1 high-risk condition, and PCV13 serotypes."

Bioaerosols from pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients are a quantitative predictor of transmission. Current methods involve sophisticated instruments and time-consuming techniques to assess viable TB bacteria in bioaerosols. We tested the feasibility of detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) specific RNA from bioaerosols retained on TB patients’ masks.
Methods
Adult PTB patients (n=33) were recruited at diagnosis before GeneXpert confirmation between April-2017 to February-2019 from private TB clinics in Mumbai. Face mask worn for 1 or 3h or N95 mask containing a cellulose acetate membrane worn for 5min by the patients were tested for the presence of Mtb RNA by quantitative PCR and bacterial load was estimated.
Results
Quantitative PCR targeting rpoB, sigA,16S and fgd1 and sequencing of rpoB confirmed the presence of Mtb specific RNA in mask samples including masks of two patients with unproductive sputum. Membrane samples had seven-fold higher RNA and bacterial load that correlated to bacterial load estimated by sputum GeneXpert.
Conclusion
The study demonstrates that patient masks can be used to sample bioaerosols for detection of viable Mtb. The findings have translational value in the diagnosis of TB and monitoring Mtb variations between and within patients useful for assessing infectiousness and treatment response."

abstract = "Background
Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in adults has rarely been reported in the literature, although its clinical significance is underestimated. This study was performed to systematically elucidate the epidemiological characteristics of adult HFMD.
Methods
A total of 266 adult patients with HFMD were recruited. The control group comprised 40 healthy adults. Swabs and serum samples were collected. Enterovirus strains were tested by RT-PCR, and cytokine expression was examined using commercial kits. Socio-demographic data were collected through follow-up telephone calls. Daily meteorological data were obtained from the China Meteorological Data Sharing Service System. Socio-economic data were collected from the statistical bureau.
Results
This study identified several unique spatiotemporal patterns in adult HFMD. Having a child recently diagnosed with HFMD was a risk factor for HFMD, whereas keeping pets was a protective factor against HFMD. The results of this study indicate the existence of subclinical carriers or misdiagnosed patients who might be the latent infectious source of HFMD. Further, this study also indicated that adults may act as the main infectious source of trans-regional spread of HFMD.
Conclusions
This study revealed the potential hazards of adult HFMD and is a reminder of the vital clinical significance of further research into adult HFMD."

This study was undertaken to determine the serotype distribution and drug susceptibility patterns in pneumococcal isolates recovered from patients with invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD).
Methods
All invasive pneumococcal isolates received between June 2014 and June 2016 were included in the study as part of a national laboratory-based IPD surveillance program. Isolates recovered from clinical specimens of normally sterile body sites were included.
Results
A total of 41 different serotypes were identified among the 132 pneumococcal isolates included in this study. The most prevalent serotypes/serogroups were 12 (8.3%), 15 (8.3%), 19F (7.6%), 3 (6.1%), and 19A (6.1%);. It was observed that overall vaccine coverage rates for pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV), PCV7, PCV10 and PCV13 were 15.9%, 24.2% and 37.1% respectively. 56.8% (n=75) of the isolates were non-susceptible to at least one antibiotic and 40.9% (n=54) of the isolates were resistant to PEN (M). 18.9% (n=25) of the isolates were multi-drug resistant (MDR).The case fatality rate was 15.9%.
Conclusion
Our study results call for broader vaccine coverage, emphasizes the need to introduce the conjugate pneumococcal vaccine for the high risk adult population and stress the importance of continuous surveillance of serotypes and antimicrobial resistance to guide vaccine development and antimicrobial stewardship activities."

A 45-year-old woman, HIV-positive for 17 years and on regular antiretroviral therapy, presented with a painful 2cm vulvar sessile lesion, a 1cm ulcerated lesion on the clitoral hood, and a slightly elevated lesion in the middle third of the tongue. Excisional biopsy and surgical removal of lesion were performed for histopathological exam. Histopathology of genital lesions showed evidence of chronic lymphoplasmacytic inflammation, intense ulcerated plasmacytosis, and squamous cells displaying HSV cytopathogenic effect. After three months, the patient presented with a new ulcerated perineal lesion. Histopathology showed evidence of chronic ulcerative-vegetative herpetic dermatitis. Consequently, topical 5% imiquimod was administered with successful results.

The aim of this study was to estimate the impact of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in secondary pneumococcal pneumonia infections on global mortality during the 2009 influenza pandemic, to estimate future pandemic mortality risk and to inform pandemic preparedness.
Methods
Risk analysis modelling was conducted using a multivariate risk formula. Literature reviews were conducted to generate global central estimates for each of the parameters of the risk formula in relation to the 2009 influenza pandemic, secondary pneumococcal pneumonia, rates of AMR, and pneumococcal vaccine efficacy as a component of pandemic preparedness.
Results
Global Streptococcus pneumoniae AMR was estimated at 21.8% to 27.6%, and contributed to 1.8% to 2.3% of deaths during the 2009 influenza pandemic. When directly applied to mortality due to multidrug resistance, pneumococcal vaccination could potentially prevent 1277 to 3754 deaths and could have reduced mortality from multidrug-resistant S. pneumoniae to 1% to 1.2%.
Conclusions
AMR in secondary pneumococcal infections contributed towards a small percentage of the global mortality during the 2009 influenza pandemic. Increased S. pneumoniae AMR could result in a three- to four-fold rise in mortality due to secondary pneumococcal infections in future influenza pandemics. Pneumococcal vaccination has an important role in preventing pneumococcal co-infections and combating AMR in all populations, and should be considered a key component of influenza pandemic preparedness or early action plans."

abstract = "Background
Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CR-BSI) is one of various complications related to hemodialysis (HD). As a result of the high rate of infection, the use of lock solutions for the prevention of CR-BSI has been studied. However, adverse effects of lock solution, such as increased emergence of strains resistant to antibiotics, which is an important concern, need to be investigated further. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of lock solution using a combination of cefazolin and gentamicin versus taurolidine and citrate in reducing CR-BSI in patients undergoing HD and to identify any adverse effects.
Methods
A prospective observational study was performed at two dialysis centers. Patients using new tunneled central venous catheters (CVC) for HD were included. Patients with a tunneled CVC were assigned to receive either antibiotic lock solution (group 1: gentamicin 7mg/ml+cefazolin 12mg/ml+heparin 3500IU/ml) or lock solution with TauroLock-Hep500 (group 2: taurolidine citrate 4%+heparin 500 IU/ml) during the inter-dialysis period. The patients were allocated to these groups according to the hemodialysis center they were attending.
Results
A total of 145 CVCs were implanted in 127 patients and were followed for 15 months: 77 CVCs (65 patients) were placed in group 1 and 68 CVCs (62 patients) in group 2. There was no difference between the two groups with regard to CR-BSI (events per 1000 catheter-days: group 1=0.79, group 2=1.10; p=0.18) or exit site infection rates (events per 1000 catheter-days: group 1=2.45, group 2=1.83; p=0.37). The groups differed in ESI pathogens, with gram-positive oxacillin-resistant pathogens more frequent in group 1 (31.8% vs. 5.0%; p=0.003). The two groups were similar in mechanical complications. In the Cox regression analysis, the internal jugular vein site was a protective factor for all catheter removal complications (hazard ratio (HR) 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19–0.91) and mechanical complications (HR 0.16, 95% CI 0.065–0.41); only ESI was a risk factor for all catheter removal complications (HR 1.79, 95% CI 1.04–3.07) and mechanical complications (HR 5.64, 95% CI 1.65–19.3).
Conclusions
The efficacy of both lock solutions was similar in preventing infections related to tunneled CVCs for HD. However, there were more oxacillin-resistant strains in patients who received antibiotic lock solution. Further studies are required to determine the optimal drug regimen and concentrations for lock solution and the associated adverse effects."

The early identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection can prevent tuberculosis (TB) transmission. A skin test with a tuberculosis recombinant allergen (Diaskintest) is a new method for identification that has been implemented in Russia. This study was performed to compare the performances of Diaskintest and QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT) in adults and children with suspected TB in Moscow, Russia.
Methods
Adults (n=85) and children (n=96) were tested using Diaskintest and QFT. Concordance and comparative analyses were performed.
Results
Diaskintest and QFT were concordant in 84% of adults and 90% of children (overall concordance 87%, κ>0.6, Kc>0.5). The concordance between QFT, Diaskintest, and the final diagnosis was good in adults (86% and 81%, respectively) and moderate in children (77% and 79%, respectively). In adults, QFT had a higher sensitivity for detecting TB than Diaskintest (82% and 68%, respectively); in children, Diaskintest was more sensitive (73% and 65%, respectively). In patients with a confirmed TB diagnosis, negative Diaskintest/QFT results were associated with low disease activity. Combined Diaskintest/QFT results identified TB patients with higher sensitivity and specificity than each test separately.
Conclusions
Diaskintest is a low-cost diagnostic tool that shows a test positivity rate similar to QFT and can be used in combination with QFT as an adjunctive test for TB diagnosis."

We report an unusual case of osteomyelitis of the left foot due to syphilitic bone involvement.
Case presentation
A 73-year-old man came to our attention with a four-month history of fever and a hypertrophic ulceration of the fifth metatarsal of the left foot. He had a history of syphilis treated years before. The CT scan showed an evident osteolytic area of the metatarsal phalangeal joint of the fifth left toe. The serological tests demonstrated a syphilitic reinfection. On suspicion of a bone localization of syphilis, an US-guided bone biopsy was performed. The histological examination with silver impregnation confirmed the diagnosis. The patient was treated with the traditional treatment of syphilis using penicillin, obtaining the complete resolution of the radiological and cutaneous alterations.

Chagas disease affects over six million people, but less than 1% are diagnosed and treated. Complicated diagnostic processes are a major barrier. Colombia’s previous diagnostic algorithm, using in-house tests, was difficult to scale up, creating significant access barriers for patients. A new algorithm using commercially manufactured immunoassays would potentially improve access, but these tests’ performance in Colombian patients with Chagas disease is not well known.
Methods
We assessed seven commercially available assays. Samples (n=501), 93.8% originating from Colombia, were characterized as positive or negative based on standard procedure at the National Reference Laboratory. Performance characteristics were calculated for individual assays and hypothetical test pairings, then compared to the existing algorithm.
Results
Five of seven assays exhibited sensitivity >98% while six showed specificity >97%. A total antigen ELISA paired with a recombinant assay provided similar performance to the current diagnostic process. Six of six assays tested proved capable of detecting different Trypanosoma cruzi genetic lineages.
Conclusions
The study indicated that several commercial assays accurately detect T. cruzi infection in Colombian patients. A simplified testing process with two commercial assays could perform comparably to the previous process, reducing cost and accessibility barriers and facilitating national scale-up."

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality; however, little is known about the prevalence and distribution of HBV in some populations and regions.
Methods
A total of 9791 participants, 15–49 years old, were enrolled in a household survey in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Peripheral blood samples were tested for markers of HBV (hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe)) and analysed, accounting for multilevel sampling and weighted to represent the population.
Results
Overall HBsAg prevalence was 4.0% (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.4–4.5%): 4.8% (95% CI 3.8–5.8%) in men and 3.2% (95% CI 2.5–3.9%) in women (p=0.01).

Methods
This multi-level analysis included both county-level data and individual-level data covering 31 provinces in mainland China. Multi-level logistic models were used to explore the factors associated with receiving TB information.
Results
This analysis included 205 990 migrants from 31 provinces and municipalities. Only 77 460 (37.60%) migrants reportedly received any TB information in mainland China. The center for disease control and prevention (CDC), the center for tuberculosis control (CTC), and the center for prevention and treatment of chronic diseases (CPTCD) were the most likely to provide TB information for migrants in comparison to other types of TB control institutes, such as general hospitals, specialized hospitals, and community healthcare centers. The odds ratios were calculated as: 1.563 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.246–1.959) for CDCs, 1.385 (95% CI 1.063–1.804) for CTCs, and 1.723 (95% CI 1.424–2.085) for CPTCDs.

Histoplasmosis is a systemic disease caused by the dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. Diagnosis is often delayed, or it is misdiagnosed as tuberculosis. In Brazil, the infection is common and cases of histoplasmosis have been described in all regions of the country; however, the real problem is underestimated since notification of histoplasmosis is not mandatory.
Methods
Human histoplasmosis cases diagnosed in Brazil and published up to December 2018 were identified through a search conducted in the PubMed/MEDLINE, SciELO, and Web of Science databases. Moreover, the isolation of H. capsulatum from animals or environmental sources in Brazil was also evaluated.
Results
A total of 207 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were evaluated, involving a total of 3530 patients with a diagnosis of histoplasmosis during the period studied. Of these patients, 78.3% were male, giving a male-to-female ratio of approximately 4:1. Histoplasmosis presented a higher frequency in individuals between the fourth and fifth decades of life. Disseminated disease was the most common form of histoplasmosis. Isolation of H. capsulatum on culture media and histopathology using staining methods were the diagnostic methods with the best efficiency. The best results in the identification of the H. capsulatum were achieved for samples from mononuclear phagocyte system components, skin and mucosa, and hematological samples. Regarding predisposing factors for histoplasmosis, HIV infection was the most common underlying condition. The overall mortality rate was 33.1%.

Optimizing antibiotic therapy has an important impact on the management of critically ill patients. Procalcitonin (PCT) is considered to be of possible use in the guidance of antibiotic stewardship; however, its efficacy remains controversial. Thus, a meta-analysis was performed to determine the efficacy of PCT-guided antibiotic therapy in critically ill patients.
Methods
The relevant literature was searched in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library covering the period from 2004 to August 2018. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included if critically ill patients were treated with PCT-guided antibiotic therapy or standard care. The primary outcome was short-term mortality; secondary endpoints were the duration of antibiotic treatment, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), and hospital LOS.
Results
Sixteen RCTs enrolling 6452 critically ill patients were included in this analysis. The pooled analysis demonstrated a comparable short-term mortality (rate ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80–1.01; p= 0.07), ICU LOS (mean difference (MD) 0.38, 95% CI −0.05 to 0.81; p=0.09), and hospital LOS (MD 0.19, 95% CI −1.56 to 1.95; p= 0.83) for PCT-guided antibiotic therapy and standard antibiotic therapy, and an antibiotic duration shorter by 0.99 days (95% CI −1.85 to −0.13 days; p= 0.02) for PCT-guided antibiotic therapy. In the subgroup analysis, patients with an average Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of <8 in the PCT-guided cessation of antibiotics group had a lower short-term mortality compared with the standard care group (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.66–0.99; p= 0.04), while no difference was found in the subgroup with an average SOFA score of >8 (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.66–1.11; p=0.23).
Conclusions
PCT-guided antibiotic therapy fails to decrease the mortality or LOS of critically ill patients with suspected or confirmed sepsis. PCT-guided cessation of antibiotic therapy could reduce the mortality in patients with an average SOFA score of <8, but not in those with an average SOFA score of >8."

Little is known about the birth prevalence and characteristics of congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in developing countries. To determine the prevalence and characteristics of congenital CMV infection in Indonesia, we conducted a prospective study in an urban birth cohort of neonates at a national referral hospital in 2016−2017, Jakarta, Indonesia.
Methods
Consecutively born neonates were screened for the presence of CMV by using pan-herpesvirus nested-PCR and Sanger sequencing in saliva and/or urine specimens. Both the neonatal clinical findings as well as maternal characteristics were also evaluated.
Results
From a total of 411 newborns screened, congenital CMV infection was confirmed in 5.8% of the neonates. These CMV-positive newborns were more likely to have ventriculomegaly and thrombocytopenia compared to CMV-negative neonates. Notably, 67% CMV-positive neonates in our study had clinical findings that required medical intervention, from which only nine presented with symptoms suggestive of congenital CMV infection. Furthermore, congenital CMV infected babies were almost four times more likely to be born to mothers that had placenta previa and placental abruption.
Conclusions
Our work highlights the high prevalence of congenital CMV infection in neonates born in one of the biggest referral hospitals in metropolitan Jakarta, Indonesia."

Tularemia is caused by Francisella tularensis and can occasionally establish foodborne transmission.
Methods
Patients were identified by active case detection through contact with the treating physicians and consent for publication was obtained. Clinical data were accumulated through a review of the patient charts. Serology, culture, and PCR methods were performed for confirmation of the diagnosis.
Case cluster
A 46-year-old patient was hospitalised in the University Hospital Frankfurt (a tertiary care hospital) for pharyngitis and cervical lymphadenitis with abscess. A diagnosis of tularemia was made serologically, but treatment with ciprofloxacin initially failed. F. tularensis was detected in pus from the lymph node using a specific real-time PCR. The use of RD1 PCR led to the identification of the subspecies holarctica. Antibiotic therapy with high-dose ciprofloxacin and gentamicin was administered and was subsequently changed to ciprofloxacin and rifampicin. During a must-tasting, five other individuals became infected with tularemia by ingestion of contaminated must. All patients required treatment durations of more than 14 days.
Conclusions
Mechanically harvested agricultural products, such as wine must, can be a source of infection, probably due to contamination with animal carcasses. The clinical course of tularemia can be complicated and prolonged and requires differentiated antibiotic treatment."

To investigate the prognostic value of phenylalanine and leucine in patients with severe infection.
Methods
Ninety-three patients with infection who had a quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score ≥2 were enrolled. Plasma phenylalanine, leucine, albumin, C-reactive protein, pre-albumin, and transferrin were measured and the SOFA score at enrollment was calculated after hospitalization.
Results
During the 3-month follow-up, 30 (32.3%) patients died. Death was associated with higher SOFA scores, a higher incidence of bacteremia and admission to the intensive care unit, higher C-reactive protein and phenylalanine levels, worse kidney function, and lower pre-albumin and transferrin levels. Patients were categorized into three groups: high-risk type 1 (phenylalanine ≥84μM), high-risk type 2 (phenylalanine <84μM and leucine <93μM), and low-risk (other). Compared to the low-risk type patients, high-risk type 1 and 2 patients had higher mortality rates (hazard ratio 10.1 (95% CI 2.33–43.5) and hazard ratio 5.56 (95% CI 1.22–25.4), respectively). Type 1 patients had higher SOFA scores, a higher incidence of admission to the intensive care unit, and higher C-reactive protein and leucine levels. Type 2 patients had lower albumin and hemoglobin levels. Multivariable analysis showed that both high-risk types were independent predictors of death.
Conclusions
Phenylalanine- and leucine-defined risk classifications provide metabolic information with prognostic value for patients with severe infection."

To describe the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of anidulafungin and to evaluate its concentration in the peritoneal fluid (PF) of patients suspected of suffering from peritoneal infection undergoing abdominal surgery, in order to ensure that therapeutic levels are achieved within the peritoneal cavity.
Methods
A descriptive, open, prospective, observational, multicentre and non-interventional study was performed. Anidulafungin was used at conventional doses. Blood and PF samples were obtained on day 2 of treatment or on any of the following days.
Results
A total of 31 patients in a serious clinical condition, as demonstrated by high mean clinical severity scale scores (APACHE II and SOFA scores), were included in the study. The mean area under the curve (AUC) in PF was 30% (31±19%) of that determined in the plasma and the maximum concentration (Cmax) reached in PF (mg/l) was close to 1 (0.9±0.5). No adverse effects were observed in any of the 31 patients.
Conclusions
Anidulafungin at conventional doses reaches PF concentrations that exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration of the usual Candida spp, which explains the proven efficacy of this echinocandin in the treatment of Candida peritonitis in critically ill patients."

Gram-negative Multi-Drug-Resistant Organisms (GNMDROs) cause an increasing burden of disease in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). We deployed a multifaceted intervention to control selection and transmission of GNMDROs and to estimate at which rate GNMDROs would decline with our interventional bundle.
Methods
Interventions implemented in 2015: in-ward Antimicrobial-Stewardship-Program for appropriate management of antimicrobial prescription; infection monitoring with nasal/rectal swabs and repeated procalcitonin assays; 24 h microbiological support (since 2016); prevention of catheter-related infections, VAPs and in-ward GNMDROs transmission; education of ICU personnel. In May 2017, epidemiological, clinical and microbiological data were collected and retrospectively analyzed. Rates of resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, as well as percentages of resistance among all Gram-negative bacteria were compared during the study period.
Results
Of 668 patients, at least one isolate was obtained from 399 patients. The proportions of patients with infection and with Gram-negative isolates were even across the 5 semesters (p = 0.8). For Klebsiella pneumoniae, the number of strains resistant to carbapenems fell from 94% to 6% (p < 0.001). Significant drops were also observed for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Percentages of resistance for all Gram-negative isolates fell from 91% to 13% (p < 0.0001). The reduction in antibiotic prescription translated in a considerable reduction of pharmacy costs. Multivariate models confirmed that the hospitalization semester was the most relevant independent predictor of resistance among Gram-negative bacteria.
Conclusions
Our experience provides further evidence that a multi-faceted intervention, aimed to reduce selection and transmission of GNMDROs with efficient microbiological support, may yield remarkable results in a short time interval."

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a rapidly developing high-income country that has experienced significant population growth, urbanization, and improvements in the standard of living since its formation in 1971. Published estimates on the prevalence of infectious intestinal diseases (IID) in the UAE are scarce and exclusively based on hospital data. The aim of this study was to provide the first prevalence estimates of IID in the UAE.
Methods
A population-based cross-sectional study design using a telephone-based questionnaire was used to estimate the IID prevalence in the previous 4 weeks in a representative sample of the Ras Al Khaimah (RAK) population from January to September 2017.
Results
Data were collected from 1254 participants (57.3% male; 25.2% <18 years). The prevalence of IID was 4.2% in the 4 weeks prior to the interview. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified that being female (odds ratio (OR) 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2–5.1) and having a middle-range monthly household income (approx. USD 4080–<6800: OR 5.42, 95% CI 1.15–25.48; approx. USD 6800–<9530: OR 7.13, 95% CI 1.47–34.57) were positively associated with IID. Age ≥6 years was negatively associated with IID (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.90–0.99). Forty-nine percent of participants with an IID sought medical care and 20.8% took over-the-counter medication.

The diversity of MenB strains and poor immunogenicity of the MenB capsular polysaccharide have made vaccine development challenging. Two MenB vaccines, including factor H binding protein (fHbp) as a major antigenic component, are now licensed for use. In addition to fHbp variant 1, the multicomponent vaccine 4CMenB contains neisserial heparin binding antigen, Neisseria adhesin A, and outer membrane vesicles containing porin A. The vast majority of circulating MenB strains contain genes encoding at least one 4CMenB component and many express genes for more than one vaccine antigen. Recent studies have suggested that serum bactericidal activity is enhanced against strains that express two or more vaccine antigens. Bacterial killing may also occur when antibodies to vaccine components are collectively present at levels that would individually be sub-lethal. The evaluation of immune responses to separate vaccine components does not take cooperative activity into account and may underestimate the overall protection. Available data on 4CMenB effectiveness indicate that this multicomponent vaccine affords broad coverage and protection against MenB disease. 4CMenB also has the potential to protect against disease caused by non-MenB meningococci and Neisseria gonorrhoeae."

abstract = "Background
Scrub typhus has emerged as a major cause of acute febrile illness in India in recent years. The causative agent, Orientia tsutsugamushi has more than 20 prototype strains due to a variable 56-kDa outer membrane protein. It is crucial to know the prevailing types in India for the success of diagnostic immunoassays and prospective vaccine candidates. In north India, the principal types circulating are largely unknown. Our tertiary care hospital caters to a large area of north India (around 7 states and one union territory). Therefore, the current study was planned to identify the genotypes of O. tsutsugamushi strains circulating in this wide area of north India.
Materials and methods
Adults and children presenting with suspected scrub typhus between July 2013 and December 2013 were included in this study. DNA was extracted from whole blood and a nested PCR was used to amplify a 483-bp region of the 56-kDa antigen gene of O. tsutsugamushi. The PCR products were purified and DNA sequencing was performed and aligned using the CLUSTAL_X2 program. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using neighbour- joining algorithms and analysed using the sequences obtained in this study and those obtained from the GenBank database.
Results
A total of 34 samples were positive for PCR. The amplicons were sequenced and analyzed. Karp-like strains predominated in all states studied (64.7%) followed by Gilliam-like (26.47 %) and 8.82% similar to Hualien 1 or S072. We did not find any Kato or Kawasaki-like strain. Karp like strains showed >99% similarity to TH2033, TH2191, TH2208, Xinjiang & Neimeng strains and Gilliam-like strains showed >99% similarity to Clone ISS -11.
Conclusion
Orientia tsutsugamushi shows a great diversity in its strains over a large geographical area of north India. This has implications in the production of both diagnostic assays and vaccine for scrub typhus."

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) represent a major clinical problem in Colombia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk factors associated with MRSA SSTI in Colombia.
Methods
A multicenter cohort study with nested case–control design was performed. Patients with an SSTI with at least 48h of inpatient care were included. Patients with an MRSA SSTI were considered the case group and patients with either a non-MRSA SSTI or with an Methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) SSTI were the control groups. A multivariate logistic regression approach was used to evaluate risk factors associated with MRSA SSTI with two different statistical models.
Results
A total 1134 patients were included. Cultures were positive for 498 patients, of which 52% (n=259) were Staphylococcus aureus. MRSA was confirmed in 68.3% of the S. aureus cultures. In the first model, independent risk factors for MRSA SSTI were identified as the presence of abscess (P<0.0001), cellulitis (P=0.0007), age 18–44 years (P=0.001), and previous outpatient treatment in the previous index visit (P=0.003); surgical site infection was a protective factor (P=0.008). In the second model, the main risk factor found was previous outpatient treatment in the previous index visit (P=0.013).
Conclusions
Community-acquired SSTIs in Colombia are commonly caused by MRSA. Therefore, clinicians should consider MRSA when designing the initial empirical treatment for purulent SSTI in Colombia, although there seems to be low awareness of this fact."

abstract = "Objective
The nucleic acid-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay is commonly applied to detect infection with Zika virus (ZIKV). However, the time- and labor-intensive sample pretreatment required to remove inhibitors that cause false-negative results in clinical samples is impractical for use in resource-limited areas. The aim was to develop a direct reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (dirRT-qPCR) assay for ZIKV diagnosis directly from clinical samples.
Methods
The combination of inhibitor-tolerant polymerases, polymerase enhancers, and dirRT-qPCR conditions was optimized for various clinical samples including blood and serum. Sensitivity was evaluated with standard DNA spiked in simulated samples. Specificity was evaluated using clinical specimens of other infections such as dengue virus and chikungunya virus.
Results
High specificity and sensitivity were achieved, and the limit of detection (LOD) of the assay was 9.5×101 ZIKV RNA copies/reaction. The on-site clinical diagnosis of ZIKV required a 5μl sample and the diagnosis could be completed within 2h.
Conclusions
This robust dirRT-qPCR assay shows a high potential for point-of-care diagnosis, and the primer–probe combinations can also be extended for other viral detection. It realizes the goal of large-scale on-site screening for viral infections and could be used for early diagnosis and the prevention and control of viral outbreaks."

abstract = "Background
Hepatitis E virus genotype 3 (HEV-3) infection usually causes self-limited acute hepatitis. In immunosuppressed patients, HEV-3 infection can rapidly progress to chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. In southern Brazil, data on HEV seroprevalence are scarce.
Methods
Testing for HEV RNA and antibodies (anti-HEV) was performed for 320 HIV-infected patients followed at the HIV/AIDS Service of the Federal University of Rio Grande between 2012 and 2013, as well as 281 blood donor samples obtained in 2015. Variables associated with anti-HEV positivity were assessed by multivariable logistic regression analysis.
Results
HIV and blood donor groups showed similar HEV seroprevalence (6.7% and 7.1%, respectively). Risk factors associated with anti-HEV detection were older age, marital status, a higher number of sexual partners, poor sanitation, and alcohol use (HIV group), and living in a rural area (blood donors). HEV RNA was detected in eight serum samples from HIV-infected patients and in one blood donor, who was also positive for anti-HEV IgM and IgG.
Conclusions
The prevalence rates of HEV infection were comparable between HIV-seropositive patients who were not severely immunocompromised and blood donors. The blood donor’s HEV isolate showed high similarity with swine HEV strains from Brazilian herds in the same region, thus indicating a potential risk of foodborne and parenteral transmission via blood transfusion."

Treatment outcomes of patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) are suboptimal and treatment options remain limited. Linezolid is associated with improved outcomes but also substantial toxicity, and details about the relationship between these are lacking from resource-poor HIV-endemic settings.
Methods
This was a prospective follow-up study of 63 South African XDR-TB patients (58.7% HIV-infected; median CD4 131 cells/μl) between 2014 and 2018. The frequency and severity of linezolid-associated adverse events and the impact on treatment outcomes were compared between linezolid interrupters and non-interrupters.
Results
Twenty-two patients (34.9%) discontinued or underwent dose reduction due to presumed linezolid-associated toxicity. Anaemia (77.3% vs. 7.3%; p< 0.001), peripheral neuropathy (63.6% vs. 14.6%; p= 0.003), and optic neuritis (18.2% vs. 9.8%; p= 0.34) occurred more frequently in linezolid interrupters than in non-interrupters. Anaemia, peripheral neuropathy, and optic neuritis occurred at a median of 5, 18, and 23 weeks, respectively, after treatment initiation. Linezolid interruption was not associated with unfavourable outcomes but was strongly associated with HIV co-infection (adjusted hazard ratio 4.831, 95% confidence interval 1.526–15.297; p= 0.007) and bacterial load (culture days to positivity; adjusted hazard ratio 0.824, 95% confidence interval 0.732– 0.927; p= 0.001).
Conclusions
Linezolid-related treatment interruption is common, is strongly associated with HIV co-infection, and system-specific toxicity occurs within predictable time frames. These data inform the clinical management of patients with drug-resistant TB."

Pertussis is a highly contagious respiratory illness mainly caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Bordetella pertussis. The infection of B. pertussis has been increasing and the current diagnosis of pertussis in children is challenging; little is known of B. pertussis infection in Chongqing.
Methods
There were 25,441 children (14,863 male and 10,578 female) with suspected pertussis enrolled in our retrospective study from December 2012 to November 2018. Then 800 children with suspected B. pertussis infection were randomly chosen to be evaluated by simultaneous amplification and testing in this prospective study.
Results
Infants younger than 12 months had the greatest burden of pertussis, and the incidence of pertussis in Chongqing appeared to have a periodic pattern. The problem of vaccine quality in China was more serious than previously reported based on the fluctuation of infection rates from 2012 to 2018. Simultaneous amplification and testing to detect B. pertussis RNA (Area Under Curve: 0.900 and Kappa value: 0.831) had better diagnostic performance than real-time PCR for B. pertussis DNA (Area Under Curve: 0.869 and Kappa value: 0.690).

We revealed the characteristics of B. pertussis infection and vaccine issues in Chongqing. Simultaneous amplification and testing could be a potential novel assay for measuring B. pertussis infection in the future."

This study delineated the clonal lineages, antibiotic resistome and plasmid replicon types in multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates from a teaching hospital in Ghana.
Methods
Identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing were done using the MALDI-TOF MS and Vitek-2 automated system. Genomic DNA extraction was carried out using the NucliSens easyMAG® (BioMérieux) kits and the DNA was subjected to whole genome sequencing (WGS) using the Illumina MiSeq platform.
Results
Of the 200 isolates obtained, 37 were identified as K. pneumoniae of which 9 were resistant to all second and third-generation cephalosporins. These 9 isolates selected for further genomic analysis were characterized by the presence of 8 diverse sequence types (STs), capsular polysaccharide serotypes (K types and wzi allelic types) and multiple genes encoding resistance to β-lactams (blaCTX-M-15, blaSHV-11, blaTEM-1B, blaOXA-1), aminoglycosides (aac(3)-IIa, strB, strA, aadA16), fluoroquinolones/quinolones (qnrB66, oqxA, oqxB) and other antibiotic classes. Resistance genes were associated with plasmids, predominantly IncFIB(K) and ColRNAI. Multiple and diverse mutations in quinolone resistance-determining regions of gyrA (S83Y, D87A) and parC (S80I, N304S) in isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin (MIC ≥ 4 mg/mL) were found. Global phylogenomic analysis affirmed the diverse clonal clustering and origin of these isolates.
Conclusions
The varied clonal clusters and resistome identified in the multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates is a major threat to the management of infections in Ghana. The molecular characterization of antibiotic resistance is thus imperative to inform strategies for containment."

A major regulatory peptide in iron metabolism, hepcidin, has been shown to predict mortality in HIV-infected tuberculosis patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether plasma hepcidin levels on admission can be used to predict the treatment outcome of patients with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) without HIV co-infection.
Methods
In this prospective observational study, a total of 35 PTB patients with Mycobacterium tuberculosis-positive sputum smears were enrolled. The relationship between plasma hepcidin levels on admission and the time period to sputum culture-negative was explored.
Results
Plasma hepcidin levels of PTB patients were significantly higher than those of healthy subjects (p<0.001). A positive correlation between hepcidin level on admission and the period until culture-negative was also observed (r=0.46, p=0.006). Furthermore, the hepcidin level showed a negative correlation with spot numbers in the positive control wells of the T-SPOT.TB assay; thus the effect of the peptide on interferon-gamma production in T cells was explored. Hepcidin reduced interferon-gamma gene transcription and interferon-gamma production in a dose-dependent manner in Jurkat cells stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin, an antigen non-specific stimulation.
Conclusions
These findings indicate that hepcidin alters immunological reactions against M. tuberculosis infection and has an influence on the outcomes of PTB patients without HIV co-infection."

Myelopathy is a well-established long-term clinical manifestation of HTLV-1 infection. Besides motor dysfunction, cognitive impairment may be another consequence of HTLV-1 infection. Moreover, inflammatory markers may be associated with cognitive impairment in these patients. The present study compared the cognitive performance of HAM/TSP patients with healthy controls and investigated the associations between cognitive performance, proviral load and blood inflammatory markers.
Methods
Eighty-three patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria for HAM/TSP were submitted to a comprehensive clinical, cognitive and functional evaluation, brain magnetic resonance imaging and determination of levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, immunoglobulins and HTLV-1 proviral load in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. The control group was composed of 88 cognitively healthy subjects, matched for age, sex and educational level.
Results
Compared to healthy subjects, HAM/TSP patients displayed significant global cognitive impairment and executive function deficits. HAM/TSP cognitive impairment was significantly associated with altered levels of IgM, IgG, IL-6 and TNF-α in blood. There was no association between HAM/TSP cognitive impairment and HTLV-1 proviral load.
Conclusions
This study suggests cognitive impairment may be a long-term clinical manifestation of HTLV-1 infection, which seems to be linked to the persistent inflammatory activity that is found in the disease."

Pneumolysin (Ply), as a major virulence factor of Streptococcus pneumoniae, has attracted increased attention for its potential value in the development of next-generation protein-based pneumococcal vaccines. This study aimed to analyze the genetic and antigenic diversity that can influence the immunogenicity of vaccines.
Methods
A total of 96 pneumococcal isolate samples were obtained from children of 1–35 months old with invasive pneumococcal diseases in Shanghai Children’s Medical Center (Shanghai, China). After DNA amplification by PCR and Sanger sequencing, Ply DNA sequences were analyzed by bioinformatics tools, including ClustalX, BioEdit and MEGA7.
Results
Two alleles, allele 1 and 2, and 10 subtypes, of which were 6 novel subtypes, were identified. Nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity among these pneumococcal isolates were >99%. Subtypes with the same amino acid sequence were more closely evolutionarily related in the phylogenetic tree. Only minor differences in the B-cell epitopes were identified in the antigenicity plots of alleles 1 and 2. The most common serotype was serotype 19A.
Conclusions
The sequence diversity of Ply is limited although some allelic variations are detected. Different alleles exhibit similar antigenic patterns. Development of Ply-based vaccines may be a promising method to combat pneumococcal infection in the future."

We collected respiratory samples from outpatients with influenza-like illness (ILI) and intensive care unit (ICU)-admitted patients with complications (pulmonary or neurological complications, myocarditis/pericarditis or invasive bacterial infection) for virus isolation and lineage typing. Demographics, epidemiological features, and vaccination history from ICU-admitted patients with complications were analyzed.
Results
From July 2013–June 2017, 21% of 11517 influenza isolates were influenza B. B/Victoria was the predominant circulating strain in 2013–2014, accounted for 56% of all influenza B positive samples and B/Yamagata was predominant in 2014–2017 (82%, 69%, and 85%, respectively). Among all typed viruses, the proportion of B/Yamagata was higher among specimens from ICU-admitted patients with complications (77%, 154/199) than from ILI outpatients (66%, 276/418, p<0.005). Compared to B/Victoria, B/Yamagata infected ICU-admitted patients with complications were older, median age (71 vs. 59 years, p<0.05), had longer durations of hospitalization (15 vs. 7.5 days, p<0.05) and ICU stays (8.5 vs. 5.5 days, p<0.05).

As is the case for all of Southeast Europe, Serbia is an area traditionally endemic for Taenia saginata and Taenia solium infections. This study was performed to analyse the epidemiological data on taeniosis and cysticercosis in Serbia for the period 1990–2018.
Methods
Data on cases of T. saginata and T. solium infection were collected via a systematic search of published articles, the grey literature, and official reports, as well as by performing clinical observational studies of patients treated in the departments for infectious diseases of hospitals and university clinics in Serbia.
Results
A total of 212 cases of taeniosis were reported, all between 1997 and 2004 when taeniosis was notifiable (incidence range 0.04–0.9/100 000 population/year). From 1990 to 2018, 170 cases of cysticercosis (all but one of neurocysticercosis), were registered (incidence range 0–0.29/100 000 population/year), with a strong decrease since 2000 and a single case in the last 9 years. The annual number of cases of both taeniosis (Pearson’s r = 0.914, p =  0.001) and cysticercosis (Pearson’s r = 0.582, p = 0.014) correlated with the consumer price index.
Conclusions
In Serbia, T. saginata and T. solium infections are autochthonous but occur only sporadically. However, the potential for re-emergence exists, depending on the socio-economic state of the country."

ERIC-PCR revealed one large clone including most carbapenemase-producing isolates indicating clonal dissemination.
Conclusion
This is the first study on carbapenem-nonsusceptible P. aeruginosa from Dubai, incriminating VIM production as well as outer membrane permeability and efflux systems as resistance mechanisms. Further studies on carbapenem-nonsusceptible P. aeruginosa in Dubai are warranted for containment of such health hazard."

Histoplasma capsulatum and Pneumocystis jirovecii are respiratory fungal pathogens that principally cause pulmonary disease. Coinfection with both pathogens is scarcely reported. This study detected this coinfection using specific molecular methods for each fungus in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of patients from a tertiary care hospital.
Materials and methods
BAL samples from 289 hospitalized patients were screened by PCR with specific markers for H. capsulatum (Hcp100) and P. jirovecii (mtLSUrRNA and mtSSUrRNA). The presence of these pathogens was confirmed by the generated sequences for each marker. The clinical and laboratory data for the patients were analyzed using statistical software.
Results
The PCR findings separated three groups of patients, where the first was represented by 60 (20.8%) histoplasmosis patients, the second by 45 (15.6%) patients with pneumocystosis, and the last group by 12 (4.2%) patients with coinfection. High similarity among the generated sequences of each species was demonstrated by BLASTn and neighbor-joining algorithms. The estimated prevalence of H. capsulatum and P. jirovecii coinfection was higher in HIV patients."

abstract = "Background and aims
It has been demonstrated that 1,25-hydroxyvitamin-D3-24-hydroxylase, encoded by CYP24A1 gene, is a key enzyme that neutralizes the active vitamin D3 metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] in response to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. This study aimed to investigate whether CYP24A1 genetic variation is associated with HCV infection outcomes.
Methods
848 HCV chronically infected subjects, 507 natural clearance subjects, and 1017 uninfected controls were enrolled. Nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in theCYP24A1 gene were genotyped using the Sequenom MassARRAY platform.
Results
After adjusting for age, gender, and routes of infection, logistic regression analyses showed that rs6013897-A was associated with an elevated risk of HCV infection (P<0.05). In addition, this study has also demonstrated that rs6068816-T significantly reduced the risk of chronic HCV infection, while rs3787557-C, rs6022999-G, and rs2248359-T significantly increased the risk of chronic HCV infection (all P<0.05). Haplotype analysis suggested that, compared to the most frequent Trs6068816Trs3787557Ars6022999Crs2248359 haplotype, the CTGT haplotype (adjusted OR=1.376, 95% CI=1.092-1.735, P=0.007) and CCAC haplotype (adjusted OR=1.483, 95% CI=1.139-1.929, P=0.003) were associated with an increased risk of chronic HCV infection.
Conclusion
These findings indicate that SNPs in CYP24A1 gene may contribute to the risk of HCV infection and chronic HCV infection among a high-risk Chinese population."

A high risk of tuberculosis (TB), chronic lung disease, and mortality have been reported among people with a history of previous TB treatment, but data from high-incidence settings remain limited. The aim of this study was to characterize general morbidity and mortality among adults who had successfully completed TB treatment in the past 5 years in a high-incidence setting in South Africa.
Methods
Adults (≥18 years) who had completed treatment for pulmonary TB between 2013 and 2017 were randomly selected from TB treatment registers. Household visits were conducted to locate and interview former TB (FTB) patients, and bacteriological testing for TB was offered. Additional data sources were used to ascertain the vitality status of FTB patients who could not be located.
Results
Addresses were located for 200 of the 223 FTB patients sampled and 89 FTB patients were contacted of whom 51 agreed to be interviewed. Approximately half reported persistent respiratory symptoms, such as shortness of breath and wheezing, and repeated lung infections. One (3.6%) of 28 patients who provided a sputum sample had culture-positive TB and another two were currently on re-treatment for TB. Fifteen deaths post treatment were ascertained, resulting in a standardized mortality ratio of 3.8 (95% confidence interval 2.3–6.3) after successful TB treatment relative to the general population.
Conclusions
In this high-incidence setting, locating and interviewing FTB patients was challenging. The study findings are consistent with a high rate of respiratory disease, including recurrent TB, and substantially elevated mortality among FTB patients."

Methods
Data were analyzed from a series of 1 phase Ib, 3 phase II, and 2 phase III studies involving 11,942 children aged 6 months through 5years.
Results
The clinical data showed that aIIV3 had statistically significantly greater immunogenicity and efficacy in the prevention of influenza compared to conventional inactivated trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines (IIV3s). The safety profile of aIIV3 was generally similar to that of nonadjuvanted IIV3, apart from an increased frequency of solicited adverse events (AEs) following vaccination. The majority of solicited AEs were mild or moderate in severity and resolved within 1 to 3 days.
Conclusions
aIIV3 was well tolerated, with immunogenicity and efficacy exceeding that of conventional IIV3 in children 6 months through 5years of age. The MF59-adjuvanted vaccine has the potential to fulfill an unmet clinical need in the prevention of seasonal influenza in this age group."

We investigated the impact of obesity (proxied as body mass index (BMI)), on short- and long-term mortality in sepsis patients.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective analysis with adult sepsis ICU patients in a US medical institution from 2001 to 2012 in the MIMIC-III database. The WHO BMI categories were used. Multivariate logistic regression assessed the relationships between BMI and 30-day and 1-year mortality.
Results
In total, 5563 patients were enrolled. Obese patients tended to be younger (P<0.001), to be female (P<0.001), to acquire worse SOFA scores (P<0.001), and to receive more aggressive treatment compared with their normal weight counterparts. Obese patients had notably longer mechanical ventilation periods and ICU and hospital lengths of stay (LOSs). In the final model, overweight and obese patients had lower 30-day (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66–0.91; OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.56–0.77, respectively) and 1-year (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71–0.96; OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.60–0.81, respectively) mortality risks than normal weight patients. In contrast, underweight patients had worse 30-day and 1-year outcomes compared with normal weight patients (P=0.01, P<0.001, respectively). In morbidly obese, severe sepsis and septic shock patients, obesity remained protective.
Conclusions
Obesity was correlated with short- and long-term survival advantages in sepsis patients."

Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) usually has its onset in the community (CO-IPD), but it can commence following hospitalization (HO-IPD). This study compared HO-IPD and CO-IPD cases during the implementation of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) program for children in Israel.
Methods
This was a nationwide retrospective cohort study of adult (age >18 years) IPD patients covering the period from the implementation of the PCV7/13 program in 2009/2010 through 2015. HO-IPD and CO-IPD were defined as IPD with onset ≥4 and ≤2 days from admission, respectively. Patient characteristics, outcome measures, serotypes, and antimicrobial susceptibility were compared for the entire cohort, followed by a matched case–control analysis.
Results
The study included 114 patients with HO-IPD and 2180 with CO-IPD. After matching HO-IPD to CO-IPD patients by age, sex, and comorbidities, the mortality rate and discharge to long-term care facility rate were significantly higher for HO-IPD patients than for CO-IPD patients (44.6% vs. 26.3% and 26.5% vs. 8.2%, respectively). HO-IPD isolates were less often covered by PCV13 (39.6% vs. 49.0%) and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine PPSV23 (56.6% vs. 71.3%) and more often resistant to penicillin (9.3% vs. 3.6%), ceftriaxone (3.8% vs. 0.75%), and levofloxacin (9.3% vs. 0.8%).
Conclusions
HO-IPD was associated with higher morbidity and mortality than CO-IPD and was more often caused by non-vaccine serotypes (primarily non-PCV13 types) and antibiotic-resistant strains."

To determine antimicrobial nonsusceptibility rates for Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter spp. in US hospitals.
Methods
We analyzed antimicrobial susceptibilities of non-duplicate Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter spp. isolates reported in 2017 from 375 US hospitals in the BD Insights Research Database. Logistic and Poisson regression modeling methods were used to estimate proportions of resistant isolates and rates per 1000 hospital admissions. National projections were generated based on raking (weighting) methods.
Results
The nationwide proportions of resistant isolates in inpatients were an estimated 12.6%, 6.6%, and 1.2% for Enterobacteriaceae with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), multidrug resistant (MDR), and carbapenem-nonsusceptible (Carb-NS) phenotypes, respectively, and 42.4% and 34.5% for Acinetobacter spp. with MDR and Carb-NS phenotypes. Resistance varied by geographic region and hospital size/type. Estimated nationwide rates per 1000 hospital admissions ranged from a high of 7.1 for ESBL Enterobacteriaceae to a low of 0.3 for Carb-NS Acinetobacter spp. The estimated number of isolates occurring in US inpatients each year was 290,220 ESBL, 173,984 MDR, and 30,194 Carb-NS for Enterobacteriaceae and 12,274 MDR and 9,991 Carb-NS for Acinetobacter spp.

Bacteraemia due to carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria is challenging. This study examined the burden of carbapenem and colistin resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii bacteraemia in Oman.
Methods
Adult patients admitted to Sultan Qaboos University Hospital between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2016 with positive blood cultures for P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, or K. pneumoniae were identified. Rates of carbapenem resistance, trends in prevalence, and 30-day all-cause mortality were examined.
Results
Two hundred and twenty-seven (29.8%) of 761 bacteraemia cases due to these three isolates were carbapenem-resistant, with 87.2% being healthcare-associated. A. baumannii caused 52% of all carbapenem-resistant bacteraemia, K. pneumoniae caused 30%, and P. aeruginosa caused 18%. Rates of carbapenem resistance in P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, and K. pneumoniae bacteraemia increased from 20%, 67%, and 0%, respectively, in 2007 to 25%, 86%, and 35%, respectively, in 2016. Seventeen (7.9%) carbapenem-resistant bacteraemia cases were also colistin-resistant.

Conclusions
The prevalence of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, and P. aeruginosa bacteraemia is increasing alarmingly in Oman, with a large proportion of K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa demonstrating additional resistance to colistin.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of de-escalation in patients under treatment with carbapenems and its impact on clinical outcomes.
Methods
A prospective observational study was conducted for 1year. Patients administered active carbapenems for at least 24h were included. Primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, mortality at 30 days after carbapenem prescription, and infection-related readmission within 30 days. De-escalation was defined as the substitution of carbapenem with narrower spectrum antimicrobial agents or its discontinuation during the first 96h of treatment.
Results
The study included 1161 patients, and de-escalation was performed in 667 (57.5%) of these. In the de-escalation group, 54.9% of cultures were positive. After propensity score matching, 30-day mortality was lower (17.4% vs. 25.7%, p=0.036), carbapenem treatment was 4 days shorter (4 vs. 8 days, p<0.001), total antibiotic therapy duration was 2 days longer (12 vs. 10 days, p=0.003), and length of hospital stay was 5 days shorter (8 vs. 13 days, p=0.008) in the de-escalated versus non-de-escalated patients. In-hospital mortality and 30-day readmission rates did not differ significantly between these groups.

abstract = "Background
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are essential in the metabolism of most drugs used today. Single nucleotide polymorphism(s) occurring in CYP genes can adversely affect drug pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety. Individuals carrying the CYP2C8*2 c.805A > T (CYP2C8*2; rs11572103) allele have impaired amodiaquine metabolism, increased risk of amodiaquine-related adverse events, and may promote the selection of drug-resistant parasite strains. This study investigated the distribution of the CYP2C8*2 allele in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo, where artesunate + amodiaquine is used as the second-line treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
Methods
A total of 285 febrile children visiting the Marien Ngouabi paediatric hospital were genotyped for CYP2C8*2 using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The allele frequencies and genotype distribution were determined.
Results
The CYP2C8*2 allele was successfully genotyped in 75% (213/285) of the study participants. The CYP2C8*2A allele had a frequency of 63%, whereas the CYP2C8*2T allele had a frequency of 37%. Genotypes CYP2C8*2AA (rapid metabolizer), CYP2C8*2AT (intermediate metabolizer), and CYP2C8*2TT (poor metabolizer) were observed in 44%, 38%, and 18% of the investigated participants, respectively.
Conclusions
This study gives the first description of CYP2C8*2 allele distribution in the Republic of Congo and highlights the potential risk of amodiaquine-related adverse events. Information from this study will be beneficial during pharmacovigilance investigations."

Experience in the region shows that in some countries there is very good surveillance of Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in health services, but there is no national data consistently in all countries. Therefore, we set to estimate the total burden of HAIs and antimicrobial use in acute care hospitals in Brazil, Venezuela, Mexico, and Colombia using the one-day point prevalence methodology.
Methods
The survey was conducted between June and July 2016. In each ward or unit, HAIs and antimicrobial use data were collected on a single day by a trained team of researchers. Also, for each patient, we collected data on risk factors for infections.
Results
One out of ten individuals surveyed had at least one healthcare-associated infection (HAI). Pneumonia and surgical site infections were the most relevant among the surveyed countries. Most of the surveyed participants, regardless of their HAI status, received antibiotics except the individuals managed in Brazil. Carbapenems and third-generation Cephalosporins were among the most frequently used antibiotics.
Conclusion
Our results add to WHO’s recent efforts to understand HAIs prevalence and antibiotic consumption in low and middle-income countries, of which we studied three that were not included in their last report."

Lassa fever (LF) causes annual outbreaks in endemic regions with high mortality of symptomatic patients. Ribavirin is recommended as standard treatment for LF in national and international guidelines but the evidence base for this recommendation has been questioned recently.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review and included 6 studies providing efficacy data of ribavirin treatment for LF (PROSPERO protocol CRD42018103994).
Results
Besides retrospective case series, the evidence mostly relies on a single prospective clinical trial with critical risk of bias. In this trial, LF associated mortality is reduced for patients with elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) when treated with ribavirin (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.23–0.73), while mortality is higher for patients without elevated AST (OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.07–5.25).
Conclusions
Based on the available data, current treatment guidelines may therefore put patients with mild LF at increased risk of death. The role of ribavirin in the treatment of LF requires urgent reassessment."

Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is usually caused by EVA71 and CVA16 except for a few cases that are caused by non-EVA71 non-CAV16 enteroviruses. Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is mostly associated with myocarditis, occasionally with HFMD.
Methods
The partial VP1 gene of enteroviruses were amplified and sequenced from 610 throat swabs from clinically confirmed HFMD children. All available CVB3 near full-length genomic and VP1 sequences were downloaded from GenBank. Phylogenetic and distance analyses were performed using MEGA 7.0.
Results
A total of 238 partial VP1 sequences were obtained, including 93 EVA71 (39%), 79 CAV16 (33%), 29 CVB3 (12%), 24 CVA6 (10%), and 13 other enterovirus serotypes (5.5%). CVB3 is classified into seven genotypes A–G according to phylogenetic and distance analyses. All CVB3 strains from Zhenjiang belonged to genotype A. In contrast to other genotypes that are prevalent in Europe and other regions of China, and often associated with aseptic meningitis and myocarditis, CVB3 genotype A strains identified in Zhenjiang were only detected among HFMD patients.
Conclusions
This high prevalence of CVB3 genotype A among HFMD children has never been reported. This phenomenon has revealed a new epidemic trend of CVB3 among HFMD in China, and it has epidemiological implications for monitoring the epidemic risk of CVB3."

Pertussis is a highly transmissible acute respiratory infection caused by the bacterial pathogen Bordetella pertussis. The purpose of this study was to develop a rapid, simple and sensitive diagnostic test for detecting this pathogen.
Methods
Here we present a recombinase aided amplification (RAA) assay incorporating competitive internal amplification control (IAC) to detect Bordetella pertussis using the DNA obtained by boiling. This assay was performed in a single closed tube at 39°C within 30min. A total of 115 clinical samples suspected of pertussis were collected and tested by the internally controlled RAA assay using both extracted DNA with the commercial kit and the DNA obtained by boiling. For comparison, the real-time PCR (RT-PCR) was also performed with DNA extraction in parallel.
Results
The sensitivity of the internally controlled RAA assay was 101 copies or 10CFU/ml per reaction in detecting plasmid DNA or B. pertussis strain. The optimum concentration of the IAC plasmid was determined to be 100 copies, and the introduction of IAC effectively reduced the occurrence of false negatives. Compared to the RT-PCR, RAA results with DNA extraction obtained 100% sensitivity and specificity, and the RAA results with heat-treated DNA showed 85.96% sensitivity and 100% specificity.
Conclusion
With the advantages of 45min turn-around time and simple steps of DNA purification, this assay could become a useful diagnostic tool for Bordetella pertussis detection and is potentially suitable for point-of-care identification to guide prompt clinical treatment."

The optimal treatment of streptococcal prosthetic joint infections (PJIs) is unclear.
Methods
A cohort of streptococcal PJIs was reviewed retrospectively in seven reference centers for the management of complex bone and joint infections, covering the period January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2012.
Results
Seventy patients with monomicrobial infections were included: 47 had infections of total hip arthroplasty and 23 had infections of total knee arthroplasty. The median age was 77 years (interquartile range (IQR) 69–83 years), the median Charlson comorbidity score was 4 (IQR 3–6), and 15.6% (n=11) had diabetes. The most commonly identified streptococcal species were Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus dysgalactiae (38.6% (n=27) and 17.1% (n=12), respectively). Debridement, antibiotics and implant retention (DAIR) was performed after a median time of 7 days (IQR 3–8 days), with polyethylene exchange (PE) in 21% of cases. After a minimum follow-up of 2 years, 27% of patients had relapsed, corresponding to 51.4% of DAIR treatment cases and 0% of one-stage (n=15) or two-stage (n=17) exchange strategy cases. Rifampicin or levofloxacin in combination therapy was not associated with a better outcome (adjusted p= 0.99). S. agalactiae species and DAIR treatment were associated with a higher risk of failure. On multivariate analysis, only DAIR treatment and S. agalactiae were independent factors of relapse. Compared to DAIR without PE, DAIR with PE was only associated with a trend towards a benefit (odds ratio 0.33, 95% confidence interval 0.06–1.96; adjusted p= 0.44).
Conclusions
Streptococcal PJIs managed with DAIR have a poor prognosis and S. agalactiae seems to be an independent factor of treatment failure."

Children with cystic fibrosis (CF) are susceptible to chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) infection. Early eradication of PA has proven short-term efficacy. No studies have evaluated the long- term impact of early eradication for CF patients, particularly those diagnosed by newborn screening (NBS). Our objective was to quantify the long-term impact of early PA eradication on the risk of chronic PA infection in children (0–18 years old) with CF prior to and following the introduction of a province-wide NBS program.
Methods
This 20-year retrospective cohort study compared 94 patients eligible for treatment with inhaled tobramycin at first PA isolation (“recent cohort”) with 27 historical controls (“historical cohort”).
Results
A smaller proportion of patients in the recent cohort developed chronic PA (24% versus 78%; P<0.001); the adjusted risk of chronic infection was 2.90 (95%CI 1.47, 5.76; P=0.002) in the historical vs recent cohort. However, NBS was not independently associated with the risk of chronic PA infection after its introduction.
Conclusions
Early eradication of PA, irrespective of early diagnosis, is associated with reduced risk of chronic PA. However, concomitant improvements in medical care since the introduction of early eradication protocols may have contributed to these long-term observed benefits."

Nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae underpins disease development and transmission. This study was performed to examine pneumococcal carriage dynamics, including density and multiple serotype carriage, in Indonesian infants during the first year of life.
Methods
Two hundred healthy infants were enrolled at 2 months of age. Eight nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from enrolment until 12 months of age. Pneumococci were detected using quantitative PCR and serotyped by microarray. Regression models assessed factors influencing pneumococcal carriage and density.
Results
Eighty-five percent of infants carried pneumococci at least once during the study. The median age at first acquisition was 129 days (interquartile range 41–216 days). The median duration of carriage was longer for the first pneumococcal acquisition compared with subsequent acquisitions (151 days vs. 95 days, p<0.0001). Of the 166 infants who carried pneumococci during the study, the majority (63.9%) carried a single pneumococcal serotype at a time. Pneumococcal carriage density was higher when upper respiratory tract infection symptoms were present, lower during antibiotic usage, decreased with age, and tended to decrease over time during a carriage episode.

abstract = "Objectives
Daptomycin has shown clinical efficacy in diabetic foot infections (DFI). However, only limited data are available on its bone penetration in this particular population. The aim of this study was to determine daptomycin bone concentrations in patients with DFI undergoing surgery after multiple daptomycin infusions and to determine bone daptomycin inhibitory quotients (IQs) for the predominant gram-positive species involved in DFI.
Methods
Fourteen adult patients hospitalized with DFI treated with daptomycin and requiring surgical bone debridement and amputation were included in this single-centre prospective study. Daptomycin concentrations in serum and bone were determined by HPLC at steady state. Bone IQs were then calculated according to different minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs; range 0.25–4mg/l) that are representative of the main MICs for Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), and Enterococcus sp populations.
Results
Residual and peak concentrations varied from 4.5mg/l to 39.9mg/l and from 31.8mg/l to 110.9mg/l, respectively. Bone daptomycin concentrations at the moment of surgery varied from 1.2mg/l to 17mg/l. Up to a MIC of 1mg/l, which is the epidemiological cut-off value (ECOFF) and breakpoint value for S. aureus and CoNS, all bone daptomycin IQs were positive. The highest bone IQs were observed with Staphylococcus species. Calculated bone IQs for Enterococcus species were often weak at MIC values near the ECOFF.
Conclusions
Daptomycin penetrates bone well in patients treated for DFI. At an initially recommended dosage of 6mg/kg, bone concentrations are likely to be effective against staphylococcal infections and infections due to low-MIC Enterococcus."

Candida auris emerged as a human pathogen in 2009 and has subsequently been identified around the world as a cause of invasive candidiasis. We did an analysis from a single institution in order to analyze risk factors and outcomes for C. auris candidemia.
Methods
Patients with candidemia were identified by the electronic medical record and reviewed for risk factors and outcome. Candida isolates were identified by Vitek2 as Candida haemulonii, but species determinations for 21 of the isolates using published molecular and proteomic methods identified all as C. auris.
Findings
From September 2010 to December 2016, C. auris accounted for 38% of 201 patients with candidemia, while C. albicans contributed 25%. C. auris patients had been hospitalized longer (mean 32 days vs. 13 days; p<0.001), were more likely to have central lines preceding candidemia than C. albicans patients (84% vs. 54%; p=<0.001) and had more commonly been treated with carbapenems (83% vs 61% for C. albicans [p=0.01]). The crude mortality was 29%, compared to 36% for C. albicans.
Conclusions
These findings suggest an opportunistic pathogen that may be less virulent, but difficult to eradicate and that control efforts should focus on antimicrobial usage."

With the increasing use of TDF in women for treatment and prevention of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV), or the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV, many nursing mothers have to understand the risk of exposure to tenofovir via breastmilk and make the decision about breastfeeding while on TDF treatment. Despite the safety record of TDF in pregnancy, some guidelines recommend against its use during breastfeeding. In this paper, we compared the dosage levels of tenofovir exposure in fetuses, breastfed infants, and children receiving tenofovir treatment. We found that breastfed infants were exposed to only 0.5%–16% of the tenofovir dosage that fetuses experienced via placental transfer, and 0.01–0.04% of the recommended weight-adjusted therapeutic dose. The assessment of toxicity risk from the dose perspective is an important and natural way of addressing safety concerns about exposure to tenofovir via breastfeeding. Based on the safety data from fetuses and children with tenofovir exposure, and the comparatively negligible exposure dosage from breastfeeding, our study supports mothers on TDF treatment should be encouraged to breastfeed."

Microscopic examination of the biopsy revealed fungal hyphae and culture was positive to a grey to black mould that lacked characteristic elements to be identified. Nucleic acid sequencing targeting the internal transcribed spacer of the ribosomal DNA identified this mould as Medicopsis romeroi. The patient benefited of an antifungal therapy with voriconazole associated with surgical excision of the lesion. No relapse of the lesion was observed during a six-month follow-up. In solid organ transplants, phaeohyphomycosis caused by Medicopsis romeroi are very rare with only 12 cases reported. The clinical history should be well assessed since the lesion can appear several years after a cutaneous trauma that happened in a tropical region.

To explore the epidemiological dynamics of dengue fever.
Methods
Epidemiological dynamics of imported and indigenous dengue cases during 2014-2018, including demographic, time-series, spatial and spatio-temporal features, were analyzed.
Results
There were 5 458 imported dengue cases and 59 183 indigenous dengue cases during 2014-2018. Both imported and indigenous dengue cases show seasonal patterns from August to November. 12.9% (12.9/100) of dengue cases were from businessmen. 58.2% (58.2/100) of dengue cases were from individuals between 21-50 years old. Imported dengue cases, mainly from Southeastern Asia, had doubled, and were distributed in 734 counties, 29 provinces, with 50% (50/100) in Yunnan. Except in 2014, indigenous dengue cases were under 5 000 every year, but the number in counties increased dramatically from 51 to 127. The total cases were distributed in 314 districts, 13 provinces. They were clustered in Yunnan border and southern Guangdong. They emerged gradually from southwestern and southern provinces to southeastern coastal provinces, and then to central and northern provinces every year. They spread from the southern regions to the central and northern regions in 2014-2018.
Conclusions
The findings of epidemiological dynamics of dengue fever are helpful to formulate targeted, strategic plans and implement effective public health prevention and control measures."

Results
Eight eligible RCTs were included. In the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, patients who switched to TAF-containing regimens had significantly better viral suppression than those continuing TDF-containing regimens at weeks 48 and 96 (RR, 1.02; 95CI, 1.00–1.03; p<0.05), but no significant difference in the per-protocol (PP) analysis (RR, 1.00; 95CI, 0.99–1.01; p>0.05).

Following the launch of the Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS), antimicrobial resistance (AMR) rates in many countries remain poorly described. This review provides an overview of published AMR data from Cambodia in the context of recently initiated national human and food-animal surveillance.
Methods
PubMed and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for articles published from 2000 to 2018, which reported antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) data for GLASS specific organisms isolated from Cambodia. Articles were screened using strict inclusion/exclusion criteria. AST data was extracted, with medians and ranges of resistance rates calculated for specific bug-drug combinations.
Results
Twenty-four papers were included for final analysis, with 20 describing isolates from human populations. Escherichia coli was the most commonly described organism, with median resistance rates from human isolates of 92.8% (n=6 articles), 46.4% (n=4), 55.4% (n=8), and 46.4% (n=5) to ampicillin, 3rd generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and gentamicin respectively.
Conclusions
Whilst resistance rates are high for several GLASS organisms, there were insufficient data to draw robust conclusions about the AMR situation in Cambodia. The recently implemented national AMR surveillance systems will begin to address this data gap."

Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be the commonest infectious disease cause of death worldwide. Tuberculosis is an important infectious disease cause of morbidity and death in renal transplant recipients. Tuberculosis can also cause loss of kidney allograft.
Objectives
The purpose of this viewpoint is to highlight the issues related to prevention, diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis in renal transplant recipients.
Methods
The PubMed database was searched for publications and guidelines on diagnosis and management of LTBI in renal transplantation. Publications on renal allograft recipients with LTBI and TB in post-operative period were also analysed. Specialist Society guidelines were also used.
Findings
Tuberculosis is one of the most important infectious disease-related causes of morbidity and death in transplant recipients. LTBI in allograft recipients continues to be a clinical management problem. It can occur either from donor kidney or from endogenous reactivation of latent tuberculosis infection or from acquiring new Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Tuberculosis can also cause loss of kidney allograft.
Conclusions
Kidney transplantation is now universally performed in high and low Tuberculosis endemic countries. A high index of awareness of the possibility of TB disease or LTBI is required prior to renal transplant aligned to reduce renal allograft damage, morbidity and death due to tuberculosis. WHO Management recommendations for LTBI screening and treatment should be followed."

abstract = "Background
In China, tuberculosis (TB) is still a major infectious disease threatening people’s health. Smear positive pulmonary TB is one of the most common infectious forms of TB and it might easily cause the outbreak in some areas. With a better understanding of the spatial-temporal variations of smear positive PTB, we would reach the targets for TB prevention and controlling, identify high-risk areas and periods. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the spatial-temporal variations of smear positive PTB.
Methods
Provincial level data of reported smear positive PTB monthly cases and incidence from January 2004 to December 2015 were obtained from the National Scientific Data Sharing Platform for Population and Health of China. Purely spatial-temporal descriptive analysis was used to characterize the distribution patterns of smear positive PTB. The global spatial auto-correlation statistics (Moran’s I) and the local indicators of spatial association (LISA) were conducted to identify the spatial auto-correlation and high risk areas of smear positive PTB cases. Furthermore, the space-time scan statistic was adopted to detect the spatial-temporal clusters in different periods.
Results
A total of 4,711,571 smear positive PTB cases were notified in China with an average annual incidence of 29.59/100,000. The proportion of male in different age groups were obviously higher than that of women. The largest number of cases was reported in the 20–24 years age group. Time-series analysis indicated that monthly incidence appeared a clearly seasonality and periodicity, which the seasonal peaks occurred in January and March. Smear positive PTB cases had a positive global spatial auto-correlation in 2013–2015 (Moran‘s I=0.186, P=0.046). Spatial clusters were identified in four periods, located in the different regions. The time period of 2004–2006, the most likely spatial-temporal cluster (RR=1.69, P<0.001) was mainly located in Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi and Anhui of central China, clustering in the time frame from January 2005 to June 2006. During 2007–2009, the most likely spatial-temporal cluster (RR=5.65, P<0.001) was located in Guizhou, clustering in the time frame from January to December 2009. The spatial-temporal clustering in the years 2010–2012 showed the most likely cluster (RR=1.44, P<0.001) was distributed in Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi and Guangdong with the time frame from January 2010 to June 2011. During 2013–2015, the most likely cluster (RR=1.86, P<0.001) was detected in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi and Guangdong from February 2013 to June 2014.
Conclusions
This study identified the spatial-temporal patterns of smear positive PTB in China and demonstrated the capability and utility of the spatial-temporal approach in epidemiology. The results of this study would contribute to estimating the high risk periods and areas, and to providing more useful information for policy-making."

High-risk human papilloma viruses (hrHPV) are the causative agents of cervical cancer, the leading cause of cancer deaths among Zimbabwean women. The objective of this study was to describe the hrHPV types found in Zimbabwe for consideration in cervical cancer screening and vaccination efforts.
Design and methods
To determine hrHPV prevalence and type distribution in Zimbabwe we implemented a community-based cross-sectional study of self-collected cervicovaginal samples with hrHPV screening using near-point-of-care Cepheid GeneXpert HPV.
Results
The hrHPV prevalence was 17% (112/643); 33% (41/123) vs. 14% (71/520) among HIV-1-positive and -negative participants, respectively (p=2.3E-07). Typing via Xpert HPV showed very good overall agreement (77.2%, kappa=0.698) with the Seegene Anyplex II HPV HR Detection kit. The most common types were HPV16, HPV18, HPV35, HPV52, HPV58, HPV68, HPV18, and HPV51, each of which appeared in 14–20% of infections. 37% (28/76) of women with positive cytology results (ASCUS+) had a type not included in the basic vaccine and 25% (19/76) had a type not currently in the nine-valent vaccine.
Conclusions
hrHPV type distribution includes less common high-risk types in rural Zimbabwe. The distribution and carcinogenicity of hrHPV type distribution should be considered during screening assay design, program development, as well as vaccine distribution and design."

To determine the antibiotic susceptibility and serotype distribution of colonizing Streptococcus pneumoniae in Tanzanian children. Serial cross-sectional surveys were performed following the national introduction of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in December 2012.
Methods
A total of 775 children less than 2 years of age were recruited at primary health centres in Moshi, Tanzania between 2013 and 2015, and samples were obtained from the nasopharynx. S. pneumoniae were isolated by culture and tested for antibiotic susceptibility by disc diffusion and E-test methods; molecular testing was used to determine serotype/group.
Results
Penicillin non-susceptibility in the isolated pneumococci increased significantly from 31% (36/116) in 2013, to 47% (30/64) in 2014 and 53% (32/60) in 2015. Non-susceptibility to amoxicillin/ampicillin and ceftriaxone was low (n=8 and n=9, respectively), while 97% (236/244) of the isolates were non-susceptible to trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole. The majority of the children (54%, n=418) had been treated with antibiotics in the past 3 months, and amoxicillin/ampicillin were overall the most commonly used antibiotics. Carriage of penicillin-non-susceptible pneumococci was more common in children with many siblings. The prevalence of PCV13 serotypes among the detected serotypes/groups decreased from 56% (40/71) in 2013 to 23% (13/56) in 2015.
Conclusions
Penicillin non-susceptibility in S. pneumoniae colonizing Tanzanian children increased during an observation period shortly after the introduction of PCV13. Measures to ensure rational use of antibiotics and more effective systems for surveillance of antibiotic resistance and serotype distribution are needed to assure continued effective treatment of pneumococcal disease."

This was a cross-sectional study of patients from Tbilisi, Georgia with cavitary DR-TB and an outcome of cure. Participants had a chest X-ray (CXR), St. George Respiratory Quality (SGRQ) survey, and pulmonary function tests (PFTs) performed. Correlations between SGRQ and PFT results and factors associated with pulmonary impairment were examined.
Results
Among 58 subjects (median age 31 years), 40% used tobacco, 59% had prior TB, and 47% underwent adjunctive surgical resection. The median follow-up time was 41 months. Follow-up CXR revealed fibrosis in 30 subjects (52%) and bronchiectasis in seven (12%). The median forced expiratory volume (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio was 0.72, with 24 subjects (41%) having a ratio of ≤0.70. Significant correlations existed between PFT measures and overall and component SGRQ scores. In linear regression, age, prior TB, and CXR fibrosis or bronchiectasis were significantly associated with decreased pulmonary function. Adjunctive surgery was significantly associated with a higher percent predicted FEV1 and FVC.
Conclusions
A high proportion of DR-TB subjects had residual pulmonary impairment, particularly with recurrent TB and severe radiological disease. The association of surgical resection with improved lung function deserves further study. PFTs and SGRQ may both be useful to evaluate lung health."

abstract = "Introduction
Oropouche fever is an under-reported and emerging infectious disease caused by Oropouche virus (OROV). Its incidence is under-estimated mainly due to clinical similarities with other endemic arboviral diseases and the lack of specific diagnostic tests. We report the first outbreak of Oropouche fever in a western region of the Peruvian Amazon in Huanuco, Peru.
Methods
A transversal study was carried out during an outbreak in the western Region of Huanuco, Peru between January and July of 2016. Blood samples of 268 patients with acute febrile syndrome were collected and analyzed for OROV via RT- PCR and genetic sequencing.
Results
Of all 268 patients, 46 (17%) cases tested positive for OROV. The most common symptoms reported were headache with a frequency of 87% (n = 40) followed by myalgia with 76% (n = 35), arthralgia with 65.2% (n = 30), retro-ocular pain 60.8% (n = 28) and hyporexia with 50% (n = 23). Some patients showed a clinical presentation suggestive of severe OROV infection, of which 4.3% (n = 2) had low platelet count, 8.6% (n = 4) had intense abdominal pain, and 2.1% (n = 1) had a presentation with thoracic pain.
Conclusion
This study reports an outbreak of OROV in a region where this virus was not previously identified. The disease caused by OROV is an emerging, underdiagnosed infection that requires further research to determine its virulence, pathogenesis, host range and vectors involved in the urban and sylvatic cycles as well as identifying new genotypes to implement sensitive and specific diagnostic tools that can be applied to endemic regions."

To assess the safety and immunogenicity of the MF59-adjuvanted seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV3; Fluad) in children aged 6 months through 5 years who are at risk of influenza complications.
Methods
A retrospective analysis was performed to examine unsolicited adverse events (AEs) in an integrated dataset from six randomized clinical studies that compared aIIV3 with non-adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV3). The integrated safety set comprised 10 784 children, of whom 373 (3%) were at risk of influenza complications.
Results
The at-risk safety population comprised 373 children aged 6 months through 5 years: 179 received aIIV3 and 194 received non-adjuvanted IIV3 (128 subjects received a licensed IIV3). The most important risk factors were respiratory system illnesses (62–70%) and infectious and parasitic diseases (33–39%). During the treatment period, unsolicited AEs occurred in 54% of at-risk children and 55% of healthy children who received aIIV3; of those receiving licensed IIV3, 59% of at-risk and 62% of healthy subjects reported an unsolicited AE. The most common AEs were infections, including upper respiratory tract infection. Serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in <10% of at-risk subjects, and no vaccine-related SAEs were observed. In the immunogenicity subset (involving 103 participants from one study), geometric mean titers (GMTs) were approximately 2- to 3-fold higher with aIIV3 than with IIV3 for all three homologous strains (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B). Seroconversion rates were high for both aIIV3 (79–96%) and IIV3 (83–89%).
Conclusions
In young children at risk of influenza complications, aIIV3 was well-tolerated and had a safety profile that was generally similar to that of non-adjuvanted IIV3. Similar to the not-at-risk population, the immune response in at-risk subjects receiving aIIV3 was increased over those receiving IIV3, suggesting aIIV3 is a valuable option in young children at risk of influenza complications."

abstract = "Objectives
To describe the direct cost of illness in pediatric and adult inpatients at a referral hospital in India.
Methods
Inpatients who tested positive for dengue were identified in the hospital records of a single private non-profit hospital over a period of 1 year and line-listed. Hospital discharge bills were obtained for pediatric and adult patients and the median costs by severity of illness for bed and treatment were estimated. Costs were also converted to US dollars (1 USD=64.6 Indian rupees (INR)).
Results
The median and interquartile range (IQR) direct costs for pediatric dengue without warning signs, dengue with warning signs, and severe dengue were 179.80 (IQR 85.51–428.51) USD, 145.06 (IQR 90.89–321.86) USD, and 933.51 (IQR 400.50–1117.43) USD, respectively. The median and IQR direct costs for adult dengue without warning signs, dengue with warning signs, and severe dengue were 312.75 (IQR 174.55–531.03) USD, 287.22 (IQR 210.96–389.34) USD, and 720.39 (IQR 389.23–1035.51) USD, respectively.
Conclusions
Children and adults with dengue incur high costs when hospitalized for dengue. Since most medical costs in India are out-of-pocket expenses, these illnesses can impact households."

abstract = "Background
Increasing rate of resistant infections is a challenge to healthcare negatively impacting therapeutic and financial outcomes. Targeted antimicrobial stewardship interventions are needed to counteract this global crisis. On large scale, we sought to identify the prevalence of resistant pathogens and their susceptibility pattern in Northern Oman.
Material and method
Retrospective analysis of all isolates processed by Suhar Hospital microbiology laboratory between Jan1st, 2016 and Dec31st, 2017. Organism identification, susceptibility and phenotyping were performed following CLSI standards and duplicate isolates were excluded. Pertinent microbiological data were collected and analyzed.
Results
Of 15,733 samples included, Gram-negative bacteria predominate by 67.76%, Gram-positive (29%) and Candida species (2.63%). Frequently isolated Gram-negative bacteria were Escherichia coli (32.39%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.16%), Klebsiellapneumoniae (19.97%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (5.22%), there was virtually no resistance to colistin and tigecycline, while a growing resistance toward ciprofloxacin and meropenem was observed. Resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae were isolated from bloodstream infection (12%). While Gram-positives were MSSA (27.23%), Streptococcus agalactiae (25.36%), MRSA (16.10%) and CoNS (12.1 %), they were almost universally susceptible to daptomycin and linezolid with low resistance (8˜20%) to clindamycin. Approximately, 50% of Staphylococci (MRSA and CoNS) required vancomycin treatment.
Conclusion
Study findings should guide targeted stewardship interventions to optimize antibiotic prescriptions. Empirical treatment options should be revised, drug-bug match therapy instituted promptly and newer agents considered. Prescribing restriction of formulary antimicrobials that still retain their activity towards bugs – like colistin, linezolid and tigecycline- is a mandatory action. Review empiric use of ciprofloxacin and meropenem to counteract growing resistance."

This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic role of PCR detection of Aspergillus DNA in the broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid in a large cohort of patients suspected to have invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA).
Methods
Consecutive immunocompromised patients who underwent bronchoscopy with BAL sampling and PCR detection of Aspergillus DNA for the diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrates were included in the study. Galactomannan (GM) antigen testing in BAL and serum and BAL fungal culture were also performed. Patients were classified as having IPA (proven/probable/possible) or no-IPA according to the EORTC/MSG diagnostic criteria.
Results
During 12 years (2005–2016), 1248 bronchoscopies were performed for 1072 patients. 77% had hematological malignancy, of them 40% had AML and 35.6% underwent HSCT. IPA was diagnosed in 531 patients (42.5%), 7-proven, 280-probable and 244-possible. PCR was positive in 266 cases, of them 213 had IPA, indicating a true positive rate of 80% (213/266) and a false positive rate of 20% (53/266). These results establish the diagnostic performance of PCR to have sensitivity of 40%, specificity of 93%, PPV- 80% and NPV-68%. Of 244 patients with possible IPA, 80 had positive PCR. Including PCR in the diagnostic criteria would move 80 cases from the possible group to the probable one. A combination of positive PCR and/or BAL-GM increases sensitivity to 74%, while positivity of both tests elevates PPV to 99.4%.
Conclusions
Inclusion PCR for the detection of Aspergillus-DNA in BAL in the mycological criteria of the EORTC/MSG definitions increases the rate and the certainty of IPA diagnosis."

A rubella epidemic has been ongoing in Japan since August 2018. In the present study, we aimed to predict the likely size of a congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) epidemic during 2018–19.
Methods
The expected number of CRS cases was estimated using an integral equation based on age-specific incidence of rubella among adult women, the time delay from gestational age of infection to diagnosis of CRS, and distribution of the mothers’ age at delivery. We used epidemic data during 2012–14 to parameterize the model and applied this in the prediction for 2018–19.
Results
In analyzing the 2012–14 epidemic data, the mean delay from the mother’s infection to diagnosis was estimated at 24.2weeks (95% confidence interval (CI): 20.7, 28.1). Applying the parameterized model, together with the more than 480 rubella cases in women in 2018 as well as delayed mother’s age at delivery in 2017, we determined that the expected number of CRS cases would be 9.7 (95% CI: 6.5, 12.5) cases. As the epidemic is ongoing, the cumulative number of CRS cases could potentially reach 96.8 (95% CI: 65.3, 125.5) cases, if rubella cases in adult women rose to 10 times the number by week 49 in 2018.
Conclusions
CRS is expected to occur an average of 24weeks following the mother’s infection with rubella virus. Accounting for an increase to 650 cases in women by week 5 in 2019, the expected number of CRS cases during 2018–19 has already exceeded 13 cases, as of week 5 in 2019."

This review discusses the results of these studies and compares them with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of common pathogens implicated in bone and joint infections in order to determine which antibiotics may have a greater potential in the treatment of such infections. Clinical outcomes were also evaluated as data were available. More than 30 antibiotics were evaluated. Overall, most antibiotics, including amoxicillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, cloxacillin, cephalosporins, carbapenems, aztreonam, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, doxycycline, vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, clindamycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, fosfomycin, rifampin, dalbavancin, and oritavancin, showed good penetration into bone and joint tissues reaching concentrations exceeding the MIC90 and/or MIC breakpoints of common bone and joint infections pathogens. Few exceptions include penicillin and metronidazole which showed a lower than optimum penetration into bones, and the latter as well as flucloxacillin had poor profiles in terms of joint space penetration. Of note, studies on joint space penetration were fewer than studies on bone tissue penetration. Although clinical studies in osteomyelitis and septic arthritis are not available for all of the evaluated antibiotics, these pharmacokinetic results indicate that agents with good penetration profiles would have a potential utilization in such infections."

To investigate the reasons for the high prevalence of epilepsy (>6%) discovered in 2015 in the Aketi health zone in the north of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Methods
Persons with epilepsy (PWE) diagnosed in a door-to-door survey in 2015 were traced and re-examined in 2017 by a neurologist. Confirmed PWE were paired with matched controls. For onchocerciasis assessment, children 7–10 years old were tested for IgG4 Onchocerca volvulus (OV16) antibodies, a rapid epidemiological mapping of onchocerciasis (REMO) study was performed, and ivermectin coverage was investigated.
Results
Forty-three (61.4%) previously diagnosed PWE were traced; the neurologist confirmed the epilepsy diagnosis in all of them. The overall OV16 positivity rate was 64.5%. Poor ivermectin coverage (55.9%) and a high prevalence of onchocercal nodules (>70%) were observed. The prevalence of epilepsy was 5.7% in Aketi rural town, with nine PWE (13.8%) experiencing head nodding seizures. A case-control study showed that PWE had lower body weight and higher ivermectin coverage in 2017 than healthy controls.
Conclusions
The high prevalence of epilepsy in the Aketi health zone, despite 14 years of community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI), was found to be associated with high onchocerciasis transmission and low ivermectin use. An awareness programme to increase ivermectin coverage and the introduction of a bi-annual CDTI programme should be considered."

The study was performed in a hospital with 300 beds. All patients who applied with URTI from 1st to 30th of April 2017 were included and the appropriateness of the antibiotics were compared with the patients in the same period in 2016. A checklist for the clinical pathway of URTI was completed by the ED physicians.
Results
351 patients were included, 176 these patients were in pre-ASP period and 175 patients were in post-ASP period. The rate of prescriptions including antibiotics was 49% in pre-ASP period and has decreased to 29% in post-ASP period (p < 0.001). Adherence to clinical pathway has increased from 50% to 80% (p < 0.001). In the post-ASP period, clinical pathway was used in 133 out of 175 patients (76%) and the consequently rate of appropriate antibiotic use was 82%.

Between 2013 and 2015, the Minawao refugee camp in Cameroon received about 51000 refugees fleeing Boko Haram. A rapid increase in population and inadequate sanitary installations increase the risk of diarrheal disease. This study was performed to assess the structure and attributes of the surveillance system in Minawao.
Methods
Updated US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines were used to evaluate the public health surveillance system. Information sources included health registers, surveillance reports, and key informant interviews. Scorecards were used to assess the simplicity, flexibility, data quality, acceptability, sensitivity, timeliness, stability, and usefulness of the system.
Results
Surveillance in Minawao is both passive and active, integrating four diseases reported weekly/immediately. All key informants agreed that surveillance was part of their routine work. Of 138 surveillance reports reviewed, all were complete; 91 (66%) were timely. Overall, 143 (100%) cases of diarrheal disease identified in health registers were reported to the next level. Only two (20%) surveillance personnel could correctly state standardized case definitions (SCD); three (30%) were unable to identify cases of diarrheal disease based on SCD.
Conclusions
In Minawao, diarrheal disease surveillance is acceptable, flexible, sensitive, and useful. To improve timeliness and the use of SCD, we recommend the use of mobile phones to report and display SCD in health facilities."

There is considerable uncertainty regarding the optimal use of rifampicin for the treatment of tuberculous (TB) meningitis. A pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation study of rifampicin concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during TB meningitis treatment was performed in this study.
Methods
Parameters for rifampicin pharmacokinetics in CSF were estimated using individual-level rifampicin pharmacokinetic data, and the model was externally validated in three separate patient cohorts. Monte Carlo simulations of rifampicin serum and CSF concentrations were performed. The area under the rifampicin CSF concentration-versus-time curve during 24 h (AUC0–24) relative to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) served as the pharmacodynamic target.
Results
Across all simulated patients on the first treatment day, 85% attained the target AUC0–24/MIC ratio of 30 under a weight-based dosing scheme approximating 10 mg/kg. At the rifampicin MIC of 0.5 mg/l, the probability of AUC0–24/MIC target attainment was 26%. With an intensified dosing strategy corresponding to 20 mg/kg, target attainment increased to 99%, including 93% with a MIC of 0.5 mg/l.
Conclusions
Under standard dosing guidelines, few TB meningitis patients would be expected to attain therapeutic rifampicin exposures in CSF when the MIC is ≥0.5 mg/l. Either downward adjustment of the rifampicin MIC breakpoint in the context of TB meningitis, or intensified rifampicin dosing upwards of 20 mg/kg/day, would reflect the likelihood of pharmacodynamic target attainment in CSF."

Vibrio vulnificus, Aeromonas hydrophila, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), group A Streptococcus, and group B Streptococcus are commonly detected causative agents of necrotizing fasciitis (NF) in Chia-Yi Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a multiplex PCR method for the simultaneous detection of five of the most important human pathogens involved in NF by using a novel combination of species-specific genes.
Methods
The samples used were collected from 99 patients with surgically confirmed NF of the extremities who were hospitalized consecutively between June 2015 and November 2017. Two sets of blood and tissue samples were collected from all patients; one set was sent to a microbiology laboratory for bacterial identification and the other set was sent to an immunohistochemistry laboratory for PCR amplification.
Results
The multiplex PCR results for the blood samples showed negative findings. The multiplex PCR results for the tissue specimens showed 28 positive findings. Fourteen (87.5%) of the 16 V. vulnificus culture-positive tissue specimens, six (75%) of the eight A. hydrophila culture-positive tissue specimens, and four (100%) of the four MRSA culture-positive tissue specimens were positive by PCR. Similarly, two (100%) of the group A Streptococcus and two (100%) of the group B Streptococcus were PCR-positive.
Conclusions
The accuracy rate of the multiplex PCR presenting positive results in these culture-positive tissue samples was 87.5% (28/32). This suggests that multiplex PCR of tissue specimens may be a useful and rapid diagnostic tool for the detection of these lethal microorganisms in patients with NF."

In 2014, South Korea expanded its national health insurance coverage to include newer antifungal agents, such as echinocandins. This study aimed to investigate the effects of policy change on the prescription patterns of antifungals, medical costs and clinical outcomes of candidemia.
Methods
This retrospective cohort enrolled hospitalized patients with candidemia at three tertiary care hospitals in South Korea from January 2012 to December 2015. The utilization of antifungal agents, medical costs, length of hospital stay (LOS), and mortality before and after the health-care benefit expansion were compared, and the factors associated with all-cause 28-day mortality during the study period were analyzed.
Results
A total of 769 candidemia cases were identified. The incidence of candidemia did not significantly vary during the study period (P = 0.253). The proportion of echinocandins, as the initial antifungal agent, and medical costs associated with candidemia significantly increased since the change in insurance coverage (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in LOS and mortality associated with candidemia before and after the health-care benefit expansion (P =  0.696 and 0.931, respectively). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that initial treatment with caspofungin was associated with decreased mortality (adjusted odds ratio: 0.784; 95% confidence interval: 0.681–0.902; reference: fluconazole).
Conclusions
Although the utilization of newer antifungal agents and medical cost for candidemia has significantly increased since the health-care benefit expansion, there has been no change in the outcome of candidemia. However, the further increased use of newer antifungals may improve the outcome of candidemia in this country."

abstract = "Background
Analysis of the molecular characteristics of isolates is very important for clinical and epidemiological study of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
Methods
Between 2010 and 2012, an epidemic period, M. pneumoniae was isolated from oropharyngeal swabs of consecutive CAP patients. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of macrolides, 23S rRNA gene sequencing, P1 gene and multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) genotyping was conducted.
Results
88.3% (181/205) of the isolates were macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae (MRMP) and all harbored an A2063 G mutation. The strains were clustered into 7 MLVA types, and P1 type 1 and type 2 lineages were co-circulated (86.3% and 13.7%). Compared with adults, no specific MLVA type contributed to higher M. pneumoniae infection in children (p =  0.14). Similar macrolide profile and genotypes of M. pneumoniae was found between outpatients and inpatients. Significant differences in proportion of P1 types and two main MLVA types 4/5/7/2 and 3/5/6/2 were observed between MRMP and macrolide-sensitive M. pneumoniae (MSMP) (p <  0.001).
Conclusions
This study demonstrates a comprehensive profile of M. pneumoniae molecular characterization among CAP patients of all age, and provides more evidences on a correlation between MLVA type 4/5/7/2 and macrolide resistance in the setting of high incidence of MRMP."

Screening for active and latent TB among migrants in low TB incidence countries may constitute an important contribution to TB elimination. E-DETECT TB, a European multi-county collaboration, aims to address the present lack of evidence on effectiveness of migrant TB screening by collating data in an international database and perform cross-country pooled and comparative analyses of screening coverage, results and linkage to care.
Method
A database was established using migrant TB screening data from participating countries’ national screening programs, national screening pilots and local research projects. All partner countries contributed to a common agreed protocol with standardized variables, pooling available numerator and denominator screening data from participating countries and sites.
Results
All collaborating members drafted and agreed upon a data sharing accord as well as a protocol that clearly defined responsibilities and data governance principles. The database has been created and data transfer is ongoing.
Conclusion
By persistence and focus the project has overcome considerable administrative, practical and legal challenges. This international collaboration provides greater power of analysis of harmonized data and thereby a unique opportunity to contribute migrant TB screening evidence. E-DETECT TB has started to invite other countries to contribute data to the database."

As a result, the breakpoints for several key drugs (i.e. amikacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin) were too high, resulting in the systematic misclassification of a proportion of resistant strains as susceptible. Moreover, a recent systematic review of clinical outcome data prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to make significant changes to its treatment guidelines. For example, capreomycin and kanamycin are no longer recommended for TB treatment because their use correlates with worse clinical outcomes. This history notwithstanding, robust breakpoints still do not exist for bedaquiline and delamanid six years after their approval. This was compounded by the fact that access to both agents for drug-susceptibility testing had initially been restricted. It is incumbent upon the European Medicines Agency, the United States Food and Drug Administration, and WHO to ensure that drug developers generate the necessary data to set breakpoints as a prerequisite for the approval of new agents."

With the appearance of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs), sofosbuvir (SOF)-based DAAs are recommended for patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) recurrence after liver transplantation (LT). Whether ribavirin (RBV) is needed by patients after LT in combination with SOF-based DAAs remains to be determined. This meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the necessity of RBV with SOF-based DAAs for post-LT patients.
Methods
PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and EMBASE databases were systematically searched for eligible studies from the databases’ inceptions until November 2018. We accepted the studies that included HCV recurrence in post-LT patients who were treated with SOF-based DAAs ± RBV, and evaluated the rate of sustained virological response 12 weeks (SVR12) after the end of treatment.
Results
Twelve studies, comprising a total of 1466 LT recipients, were included in this study. The pooled SVR12 of these patients was 91% (95% CI: 84% to 95%). There was no statistical difference of SVR12 in the patients treated with SOF-based DAAs + RBV versus –RBV group (risk ratio [RR] = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.03; P = 0.35) by different therapy duration (P = 0.26), with different targets of DAAs (P = 0.13) and in different regions (P = 0.34) but a tendency for a higher incidence of anemia in the +RBV group than in the −RBV group (RR = 5.18; 95% CI: 3.41 to 7.86; p < 0.00001).
Conclusion
The addition of RBV may not contribute to a higher SVR rate and could increase the incidence of anemia, so RBV is not necessary in SOF-based DAAs for patients with HCV recurrence after LT."

The hepatitis A vaccine (HepA) has been included in the national expanded program on immunization (EPI) in China since 2008. This study was performed to evaluate the change in dynamics of the seroepidemiology of hepatitis A virus (HAV) before and after the introduction of the program.
Methods
The trends in seroepidemiology of anti-HAV antibodies were examined in Shandong Province, China, drawing on two population-based samples of persons aged 1–59 years, one obtained in the year 2006 (n = 6682) and the other in 2014 (n = 5095).
Results
A dramatic increase in seroprevalence of anti-HAV antibodies from 30.76% (95% confidence interval (CI) 26.24–35.28%) to 77.46% (95% CI 74.04–80.87%) among children aged 1.5–7 years (born after HepA was recommended for routine childhood immunization), as well as an increase from 35.32% (95% CI 29.31–41.33%) to 66.69% (95% CI 55.59–77.80%) in subjects aged 8–14 years, was observed in 2014 when compared with 2006. By contrast, a decline in seroprevalence among subjects aged 15–29 years, as seen particularly in those 20–29 years of age, from 85.72% (95% CI 80.29–91.14%) to 69.24% (95% CI 62.02–76.45%), was found in this study. There was no statistically significant difference in seroprevalence between 2006 and 2014 among the subjects older than 30 years of age.
Conclusions
The national HepA routine immunization program has had a positive effect, leading to an increase in anti-HAV seroprevalence among children in Shandong Province, China. More attention should be paid to young adults in the province."

Chikungunya (CHIKV) is an arbovirus that causes acute, debilitating polyarthritis. Its diagnosis can be difficult for clinicians not used to managing joint diseases or detecting synovitis. Joint Doppler ultrasonography (DUS) is a simple, non-invasive examination, able to visualize synovitis. Its diagnostic and prognostic value in rheumatoid arthritis is well-established.
Methods
Patients with serologically proven acute arbovirosis where included. Clinical examination and joint count were performed (DAS score). Ultrasound examination was performed by another clinician — experienced in joint DUS — who also performed ultrasound joint score. Joints were examined by DUS in B-mode looking for: subcutaneous infiltration, effusion, tenosynovitis, erosion and Doppler signal.
Results
In our experience, joint DUS is able to detect effusions in 92.8% of painful joints, with 28.3% of the effusions emitting a high-power Doppler signal. No erosion was observed. Subcutaneous inflammatory infiltration of the ankles (aseptic cellulitis) was found in 28.6% of patients.
Conclusion
Joint DUS is able to detect objective signs responsible for joint pain, which can be useful for practitioners not accustomed to this type of pathology. It also makes possible distinction between articular and periarticular manifestations."

Although pleural effusion is a common clinical manifestation, the differential diagnosis of the cause of pleural effusion is often challenging, especially in the early differentiation of tuberculous pleurisy (TP) from other pleural effusion. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of commonly used laboratory tests for the early diagnosis of difficult cases of pleural effusion.
Methods
Patients with undiagnosed pleural effusion were enrolled and subjected to five laboratory tests including thoracoscopy, pleural fluid adenosine deaminase assay (ADA), serum tuberculosis antibody test (TB-antibody), tuberculin skin test (TST), and T-SPOT.TB assay. The diagnosis of TP was established based on pleural histology and mycobacterial culture. The different tests were compared for diagnostic performance.
Results
A total of 106 patients were enrolled; their mean age was 53 years and 70.8% were male. Seventy-two (68%) of them were confirmed to have TP. When used individually, the five laboratory tests showed highly variable performance parameters, including sensitivity ranging from 46% to 92% and specificity ranging from 33% to 82%. When used in different combinations, thoracoscopy combined with TST or TB-antibody showed the optimal performance parameters, with a sensitivity of 80.8% and a specificity of 85.7%.
Conclusions
The results of this study suggest that the combination of thoracoscopy with TST or TB-antibody test is the best choice for the early diagnosis of difficult cases of TP in high TB burden countries."

The aim of our study was to characterize anal Ureaplasma positivity among a cohort of HIV positive MSM and evaluate possible association with papillomavirus infection at the same site.
Methods
Anal swab samples, collected as part of routine screening for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhea, were additionally tested for HPV genotypes as well as for Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma using nucleic acid amplification method.
Results
Out of a total of 222 study participants, 195 (89%, 95% CI (84.9–93.2)) were positive for HPV, approximately three quarter being high-risk genotypes. Forty three individuals (19.4%, 95% CI (14.4–24.3)) harbored Ureaplasma spp. Infection with high-risk HPV types was significantly associated with co-presence of Ureaplasma with an odds ratio (95% confidence-interval) of 2.59 (1.03–6.54), P = 0.04.
Conclusion
Besides a high predominance of HPV infection, asymptomatic HIV positive MSM had a high prevalence of anal Ureaplasma positivity. Concomitant infections with high-risk HPV genotypes were common and statistically significant. The role of this co-existence as a potential risk factor for anal carcinogenesis needs further elucidation."

Information arising from cancer studies and other modalities – where local chronic inflammation leads to immunopathology – can help provide insights into the biological pathways at play in LTBI granulomas. Translational studies using patient material as well as LTBI+ donor-derived tissue samples are instrumental in understanding the various components of granuloma dynamics, immunological landscapes therein and how this could help to identify therapeutic targets. Deep sequencing technologies may aid to decipher the genetic changes in lung granuloma and blood samples from LTBI+ individuals associated with progression to active TB disease.

To evaluate the contribution of a multiplex PCR for respiratory viruses on antibiotic and antiviral prescription, ancillary test prescription, admission and length of stay of patients.
Methods
Two hundred ninety-one adult and pediatric patients visiting the emergency department during the 2015–2016 influenza epidemic were prospectively included and immediately tested 24/7 using the FilmArray Respiratory Panel. The results were communicated to the practitioner in charge as soon as they became available. Clinical and biological data were gathered and analyzed.
Findings
Results from the FilmArray Respiratory Panel do not appear to impact admission or antibiotic prescription, with the exception of a lower admission rate for children who tested positive for influenza B. Parameters that account for the clinical decisions evaluated are CRP level, white blood cell count, suspected or proven bacterial infection and, for adult patients only, signs of respiratory distress. Length of stay is also not significantly different between patients with a positive and a negative result. A rapid influenza test result permits a more appropriate prescription of oseltamivir."

The clinical manifestations of Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) are not fully known, for example its effect on birth weight. This study estimated the prevalence of low birth weight (LBW) among children with CZS, and identified associated factors.
Methods
Cross-sectional study involving 393 children with CZS living in Bahia, Brazil, in 2015–2017. Official Information Systems were the data sources. We calculated LBW prevalence and applied Logistic Regression to assess associated factors.
Results
Prevalence of LBW among children with CZS was 37.2%. Excluding pre-term births the proportion was 29.9%. This prevalence was 81.0% and 28.0% among children born pre-term and term/post term, respectively. There was a higher proportion (53.2%) in female children, and in those delivered by cesarean section (51.4%). Most mothers were single/separated (62.1%) and had a low level of schooling (70.0%). In the model adjusted for type of delivery, preterm births presented a 10.8 times greater chance of presenting LBW than term/post-term ones. However, the Confidence Interval was very wide. Adjusting for gestation duration, children born by cesarean section had a 1.63 higher probability of presenting LBW than those born by vaginal delivery (OR=1,63; CI95% 1.01, 2.63).
Conclusions
The prevalence of LBW among children with CZS was very elevated, both preterm and term/post-term live births. This can contribute to increasing their risk for morbimortality. The association of LBW with prematurity and cesarean deliveries is known, but in children with CZS, it has not been clarified whether or not this is related to pathological conditions caused by fetal infection by the Zika virus."

To make an informed viewpoint on the usefulness of Tuberculin Skin test (TST) compared to Interferon Gamma Release Assays (IGRAs) for diagnosis of Latent TB Infection (LTBI) in different geographical settings.
Methods
We reviewed the current literature on TST compared to IGRA, including national implementation of WHO LTBI recommendations and retrospective data over the past 7 years at the National Institute for Infectious Diseases “L. Spallanzani” as indirect indicator of usage of both tests under actual programmatic conditions.
Results
Current national guidelines vary considerably, reflecting the uncertainty and rapidly evolving evidence about the potential use of these tests. Data from Institute “L. Spallanzani” showed IGRA concordance in TST positive subjects only in 54.74% of subjects, while there was strong concordance between two tests in TST negative subjects (93.78%).
Conclusion
Neither IGRAs nor TST can distinguish active TB from LTBI. TST will continue to be clinically useful in low and high TB endemic areas until more accurate and predictive tests will become available. Clinical judgment remains fundamental in choosing between IGRA/TST tests and interpreting their results."

abstract = "Background
Russia, together with other former Soviet Union countries, is characterized by one of the highest burdens of drug-resistant tuberculosis. Published data on the drug-resistant tuberculosis for these countries are limited, and it is not clear whether current treatment regimens remain effective against constantly evolving drug-resistant strains.
Objectives
The aim of the study was to evaluate treatment efficacy of patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR), extensively drug-resistant (XDR) and drug-susceptible (DSTB) tuberculosis in the most populous region of Russia (Bashkortostan) that borders with Central Asia.
Methods
A retrospective cohort study was performed on 436 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis who were enrolled between January 1, 2016, and February 28, 2018, and received treatment according to WHO recommendations. Altogether, 369 patients completed the full course of chemotherapy. Clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of DSTB, MDR, and XDR-TB patients were analyzed.
Results
Of 436 patients, 169 (39%) had XDR-TB, 94 (22%) had MDR-TB and 173 (40%) had DSTB. Half of the MDR-TB patients (44%) and 82% of XDR-TB patients failed treatment. Patients with DSTB had unexpectedly poor treatment efficacy: only 67% had treatment success. We found that most of the MDR isolates from our patients were resistant to all first-line drugs, and a majority of the XDR isolates were resistant to more than 6–7 anti-TB drugs. While this can explain poor treatment efficacy in drug-resistant cases, causes of poor treatment efficacy in DSTB patients remain unclear. Finally, a considerable fraction (46%) of newly diagnosed patients had MDR-TB (27%) and XDR-TB (19%), suggesting that drug-resistant Mtb is being transmitted in the general population. To our best knowledge, this study is the first one to report XDR-TB prevalence in Russia in recent years (2016–2018).
Conclusions
MDR and XDR-TB became more common in recent years and treatment efficacy is declining at the face of more extensive drug resistance. There is evidence for the transmission of resistant strains in the general population, which calls for urgent changes not only in clinical practice but also in measures to prevent spread in the general population."

Compare the immunogenicity of MF59-adjuvanted trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV3; Fluad™) versus conventional trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) in an integrated dataset using a meta-analysis.
Methods
In a meta-analysis, the immunogenicity of aIIV3 in subjects ≥65 years of age was compared with IIV3 immunogenicity using hemagglutination inhibition assay results from 23 phase I through III randomized controlled trials, including 16 first-dose vaccination studies and 7 revaccination studies assessing immunogenicity after second or third annual vaccination.
Results
The full analysis set consisted of 11,105 subjects (5869 aIIV3 and 5236 IIV3). In the revaccination studies, 822 individuals received 2 consecutive annual influenza vaccinations (492 aIIV3 and 330 IIV3), and 237 received 3 (150 aIIV3 and 87 IIV3). Overall, across all strains, the meta-analyzed point estimates for seroconversion (SC) and geometric mean titer (GMT) ratio were significantly higher for aIIV3 versus IIV3. The meta-analyzed percent differences in SC with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B strain were 9.5% (5.2–13.9), 10.5% (6.6–14.5), and 12.7% (8.6–16.8), respectively. The meta-analyzed GMT ratios with corresponding 95% CI for A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B strain were 1.15 (1.01–1.31), 1.30 (1.18–1.44), 1.23 (1.15–1.31). Antibody responses against heterologous influenza strains were also significantly higher with aIIV3. Revaccination studies showed continued robust immune response to aIIV3 with repeated vaccination.
Conclusions
aIIV3 elicited a statistically significantly greater immune response compared to conventional IIV3 in older adults, increasing the breadth and duration of the immune response."

To evaluate the utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with an advanced motion correction technique in characterizing lung tissue changes and lesions induced by pulmonary tuberculosis (TB).
Methods
Sixty-three subjects with computed tomography (CT) features of pulmonary TB underwent lung MRI. All subjects with pulmonary TB were confirmed by acid-fast bacillus (AFB) testing or the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. T2-weighted turbo spin echo (TSE) sequence MRI with the MultiVane motion correction technique was used to image the lungs. Routine lung CT images were obtained as reference. MRI and CT images were reviewed by multiple readers independently. The performance of MRI in depicting abnormalities induced by pulmonary TB and their morphological changes were evaluated and compared with the performance of CT.
Results
Lung MRI found pulmonary abnormalities in all 63 TB subjects, with satisfactory quality. With the implementation of MultiVane for T2-weighted TSE sequences to reduce the motion correction effect, MRI showed excellent agreement with CT in detecting abnormal imaging features of pulmonary TB (κ=0.88, p<0.001), such as tree-in-bud sign, ground-glass opacity, consolidation, mass, and cavitation. MRI was advantageous in identifying caseation and liquefactive necrosis based on inhomogeneous signal distribution within consolidations and also in identifying mild pleural effusion. The optimized lung MRI was comparable to CT in detecting non-calcified nodules (κ=0.90), with overall sensitivity of 50.0%, 91.1%, and 100% for nodules of size <5 mm, 5–10 mm, and >10 mm, respectively. However, MRI was less effective in identifying lesions with calcification.
Conclusions
The clinical implementation of an optimized MRI protocol with the MultiVane motion correction technique for imaging pulmonary TB is feasible. Lung MRI without ionizing radiation is a promising alternative to the clinical standard CT, especially for pregnant women, children, adolescents, and patients requiring short-term and repeated follow-up observations."

Novel formulations (gastro-resistant tablet and intravenous solution) of posaconazole (POS) have been approved in prophylaxis and therapy of invasive fungal diseases (IFDs). Study aim was to analyze treatment strategies and clinical effectiveness.
Methods
We set up a web-based registry on www.ClinicalSurveys.net for documentation of comprehensive data of patients who received novel POS formulations. Data analysis was split into two groups of patients who received novel POS formulations for antifungal prophylaxis (posaconazole prophylaxis group) and antifungal therapy (posaconazole therapy group), respectively.
Results
Overall, 180 patients (151 in the posaconazole prophylaxis group and 29 in the posaconazole therapy group) from six German tertiary care centers and hospitalized between 05/2014 – 03/2016 were observed. Median age was 58 years (range: 19 – 77 years) and the most common risk factor for IFD was chemotherapy (n = 136; 76%). In the posaconazole prophylaxis group and posaconazole therapy group, median POS serum levels at steady-state were 1,068 μg/L (IQR 573–1,498 μg/L) and 904 μg/L (IQR 728–1,550 μg/L), respectively (P = 0.776). During antifungal prophylaxis with POS, nine (6%) probable/proven fungal breakthroughs were reported and overall survival rate of hospitalization was 86%. The median overall duration of POS therapy was 18 days (IQR: 7 – 23 days). Fourteen patients (48%) had progressive IFD under POS therapy, of these five patients (36%) died related to or likely related to IFD.
Conclusions
Our study demonstrates clinical effectiveness of antifungal prophylaxis with novel POS formulations. In patients treated for possible/probable/proven IFD, we observed considerable mortality in patients receiving salvage treatment and with infections due to rare fungal species."

Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination of girls was introduced in Germany in 2007. However, data on the distribution of vaccine-relevant HPV types in the general population in Germany in the prevaccine era are limited.
Methods
Serum samples collected during the German National Health Interview and Examination Survey 1998 (GNHIES98), a nationally representative study including men and women aged 18–79 years, were tested for antibodies to 19 mucosal and cutaneous HPV types. Multivariable regression models were developed to identify associations between demographic and behavioral characteristics and HPV seropositivity.
Results
Of the 6517 serum samples tested, almost a quarter was seropositive for at least one of the nine HPV vaccine types with no clear age-pattern. HPV-6 and HPV-59 were the most common mucosal types, while HPV-1 and HPV-4 were the most common cutaneous HPV types. Factors independently associated with HPV-16 seroprevalence were seropositive to other sexually transmitted infections and lifetime number of sex partners, as well as urbanity (only among females).
Conclusions
Prevalence of naturally acquired antibodies to HPV types which can be prevented by vaccination is high in both sexes and all age groups. These data can serve as baseline estimates to evaluate the population-level impact of the current vaccination strategy."

Nigeria has the highest rate of mother to child transmission of HIV (MTCT) in the world. By 2015, all Global Plan priority countries, except Nigeria, had adopted the Option B+ programme. Nigeria finally adopted Option B+ in 2016 with full implementation reported in 2017. We examined adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among pregnant women since the rollout of Option B+ in Nigeria.
Methods
A cross sectional approach was adopted that involved dissemination of a survey (Adult AIDS Clinical Trial Groups [AACTG] standardised survey) to HIV positive pregnant women, to assess adherence to ART. This study was conducted from February to June, 2018 in four health care sites in Akwa Ibom State, in the South-South region of Nigeria. Bootstrapping was used to estimate the 95% confidence interval of the prevalence of adherence. Bivariate associations between patient demographic characteristics and medication taking behaviours, and the outcome variable of ART adherence were examined using Chi-square tests. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors independently associated with adherence.
Results
Of the 275 women (response rate=92.6%), 32.7% (95% CI: 26.9–38.5) self-reported taking all ART doses in the past 96 hours. In the multivariable logistic regression analyses, there were positive associations between an increased education level (OR=1.7, p=0.006) and disclosure of HIV status (OR=2.3, p=0.024), and medication adherence. For women who had previous prevention of MTCT exposure, the odds of medication adherence were 2.5 times higher compared with those with no previous MTCT exposure (OR=2.5, p=0.005).
Conclusion
Adherence to ART among pregnant women in Nigeria is low. There is a need to improve adherence during pregnancy under the Option B+ programme in Nigeria."

abstract = "Background
Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease endemic in Nigeria. The 2018 Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria was unprecedented, with 8% of all cases occurring among healthcare workers (HCWs). A disproportionately high number of these infections occurred in HCWs working in a tertiary health facility in Nigeria. This paper describes the cluster of Lassa fever infections among HCWs in a treatment centre and the lessons learnt.
Methods
We analysed clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data from surveillance and laboratory records kept during the 2018 outbreak. Interviews were conducted with surviving HCWs using a questionnaire developed specifically for the investigation of Lassa fever infections in HCWs. Descriptive analysis of the data was performed in Microsoft excel.
Results
The index case was a 15-year-old male who presented at the health facility with fever and uncontrolled nasopharyngeal bleeding, following a recent uvulectomy by a traditional healer. Overall, 16 HCWs were affected (15 confirmed and 1 probable) with five deaths (CFR-31.6%). Of the 15 confirmed cases, five (33.3%) were asymptomatic. Nine HCWs were direct contacts of the index case; the remaining six HCWs had no direct contact with the index case. HCW interviews identified a low index of suspicion for Lassa fever leading to inadequate infection prevention and control (IPC) practices as possible contributing factors to nosocomial transmission.
Conclusion
Maintaining a high index of suspicion for Lassa fever in all patients, especially in endemic areas, is essential in adhering to adequate IPC practices in health facilities in order to prevent nosocomial transmission of Lassa fever among HCWs. There is a need to continually train and sensitise HCWs on strict adherence to IPC measures while providing care, irrespective of a patient’s provisional diagnosis."

Linkage points out 12.1% (115/944) of under-reporting in the 944 deaths identified. Early deaths accounted for 74.6% (705/944). The male sex (75.8%) was associated with the early death group. Almost half of the deaths reported in notification system (414/829) had one or more vulnerabilities. Early death were associated with respiratory system diseases and symptoms (p=0.0001) and mental and behavioral disorders (p=0.0001).
Conclusion
High number of early deaths due TB indicate the need to seek out the respiratory symptomatic and use faster diagnostic methods. Strategies for treatment adherence, adequate monitoring of comorbidities and multisectorial support may prevent early and late death. The presence of vulnerabilities indicates that efforts beyond the health sector are needed in order to eliminate tuberculosis as public health problem."

abstract = "Objectives
The epidemiology of disease caused by group B Streptococcus (GBS; Streptococcus agalactiae) outside pregnancy and the neonatal period is poorly characterized. The aim of this study was to quantify the role of GBS as a cause of surgical site and non-invasive infections at all ages.
Methods
A systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42017068914) and meta-analysis of GBS as a proportion (%) of bacterial isolates from surgical site infection (SSI), skin/soft tissue infection (SSTI), urinary tract infection (UTI), and respiratory tract infection (RTI) was conducted.
Results
Seventy-four studies and data sources were included, covering 67 countries. In orthopaedic surgery, GBS accounted for 0.37% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08–1.68%), 0.87% (95% CI 0.33–2.28%), and 1.46% (95% CI 0.49–4.29%) of superficial, deep, and organ/space SSI, respectively. GBS played a more significant role as a cause of post-caesarean section SSI, detected in 2.92% (95% CI 1.51–5.55%), 1.93% (95% CI 0.97–3.81%), and 9.69% (95% CI 6.72–13.8%) of superficial, deep, and organ/space SSI. Of the SSTI isolates, 1.89% (95% CI 1.16–3.05%) were GBS. The prevalence of GBS in community and hospital UTI isolates was 1.61% (1.13–2.30%) and 0.73% (0.43–1.23%), respectively. GBS was uncommonly associated with RTI, accounting for 0.35% (95% CI 0.19–0.63%) of community and 0.27% (95% CI 0.15–0.48%) of hospital RTI isolates.
Conclusions
GBS is implicated in a small proportion of surgical site and non-invasive infections, but a substantial proportion of invasive SSI post-caesarean section."

abstract = "Background
Amhara Region has the largest at-risk population in Ethiopia, with widespread traditional practices that are likely to increase transmission of HIV. However, the identification and characterization of HIV hotspots within this region have not been undertaken. This study aimed to explore and describe the geographical pattern of HIV infection using notification data in Amhara Region, Ethiopia.
Methods
Data on HIV infection at the district level were obtained from the Amhara Regional Health Bureau. A Bayesian conditional autoregressive (CAR) model was used to explore the association between HIV infection and socio-demographic variables in OpenBUGS.
Results
A total of 35 210 new HIV cases were reported during 2015–2017 in Amhara Region, Ethiopia. Metema and Mirab Armacho districts were found to be hotspots throughout the study period. There was a decrease in HIV infection in 2016 (odds ratio 0.77, 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.72–0.82) and 2017 (odds ratio 0.71, 95% CrI 0.60–0.76) as compared with HIV infection in 2015. HIV infection increased by 1.004 (95% CrI 1.001–1.008) and 1.47 (95% CrI 1.11–3.59) for a one-unit increase in the proportion of the population who had never attended school and migrants, respectively.
Conclusions
This study identified spatial clustering of HIV infection in Amhara Region, with a slight reduction in the annual infection rates from 2015 to 2017. The proportion of the population who were migrants or who had a low educational status was associated with a high risk of infection. Access to HIV counselling and the promotion of condom utilization, integrated with other health care services, targeting those with a lower level of education and seasonal migrants, are important strategies for the prevention of new HIV infections."

The Guide to Infection Control in the Hospital (Guide) is an open access resource produced by the International Society for Infectious Diseases (ISID) to assist in the prevention of infection acquisition and transmission worldwide. A survey was distributed to 8055 current Guide users to understand their needs.
Methods
The survey consisted of 48-questions regarding infection prevention and control (IPC) availability and needs. Dichotomous questions, Likert scale-type questions, and open-and closed-ended questions were used.
Results
Respondents (n=1121) from 194 countries and six WHO regions participated in the survey. 43% (488) identified as physicians. Personal protective equipment (PPE) availability, training, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing varied between regions. Only 11% of respondents from low-income countries reported consistent access to respiratory equipment, 12% to isolation gowns, 4% to negative pressure rooms or personnel trained in IPC, and 20% to antimicrobial resistance testing. This differed significantly to high and upper middle-income resource settings (p<0.05). 80% of all respondents used smartphones or tablets at the workplace.
Conclusions
This survey demonstrates varied access to IPC equipment and training between high and low-income settings worldwide. Our results demonstrated many respondents across all regions utilize mobile technology, providing opportunities for rapid distribution of resource specific, up-to-date IPC content."

abstract = "Objective
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) encephalitis is a disease that primarily affects immunocompromised hosts. Only a few cases have been reported in immunocompetent individuals, especially in children. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of immunocompetent children with CMV encephalitis attending a single medical center in southwest China over a 15-year period.
Methods
The medical records of children with confirmed CMV encephalitis who were hospitalized in the Children’s Hospital of Chongqing Medical University during the years 2002–2017 were reviewed. An analysis of the clinical features, laboratory data, and the treatment response to antiviral therapy was performed.
Results
The median age of the patients (n = 18) was 5.1 months. ‘Seizures’ was the earliest and most common neurological symptom, while fever and poor feeding were also present in most patients. Elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein was the most noticeable biochemical finding. After treatment with two-stage ganciclovir, all patients showed a steady clinical improvement. The total adverse drug reaction (ADR) rate was 27.3%, mainly presenting as effects on the hematopoietic system and liver. During follow-up ranging from 3 to 36 months, nine patients showed a complete recovery. At the stage of diagnosis, CMV PCR of CSF was positive in all patients, while anti-CMV IgM was positive in 77.8% of patients. After treatment with two-stage ganciclovir, all patients showed a negative result for CMV genome in the CSF and a clear decrease in the urine.
Conclusions
The possibility of CMV encephalitis in the immunocompetent child should be kept in mind, especially in those younger than 6 months of age. Suspicion for a diagnosis of CMV encephalitis is needed in the presence of unexplained prominent seizure, fever, poor feeding, and a marked elevation of protein level in the CSF. CMV PCR assays of CSF are necessary to determine the etiology. Furthermore, measurement of the CMV load in CSF and urine may be useful for evaluating the response to treatment and the outcome. Ganciclovir may lead to clinical improvement with limited ADR. CMV encephalitis in the immunocompetent infant does not necessarily indicate a poor short-term prognosis."

The Japanese Respiratory Society recently updated its prognostic guidelines for pneumonia, recommending that pneumonia severity be evaluated using the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) and quick SOFA (qSOFA) scoring systems in a therapeutic strategy flowchart. However, the efficacy and accuracy of these tools are still unknown.
Methods
All patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) who were admitted to the study institution between 2014 and 2017 were enrolled in this study. Pneumonia severity on admission was evaluated by A-DROP, CURB-65, PSI, I-ROAD, qSOFA, and SOFA scoring systems. Prognostic factors for 30-day mortality were also analyzed.
Results
This study included 406 patients, 257 male (63%) and 149 female (37%). The median age was 79 years (range 19–103 years). The 30-day and in-hospital mortality rates were both 5%. With respect to the diagnostic value of the predictive assessments for 30-day mortality, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) value for the SOFA score was 0.769 for CAP patients and 0.774 for HCAP patients. Further, the AUROC values for the SOFA score in CAP and HCAP patients with a qSOFA score ≥2 were 0.829 and 0.784, respectively, for 30-day mortality.
Conclusions
qSOFA and SOFA scores were able to correctly evaluate the severity of CAP and HCAP."

We observed that the expression of these genes was associated with pathogenicity and virulence of mycobacteria as infection with Mycobacterium bovis BCG failed to significantly induce OAS expression. Further, we observed that after silencing of these genes, M. tb CFU counts increased significantly 96h post-infection in comparison to the respective controls. Luminex revealed that OAS silencing significantly decreased IL-1β, TNF-α and MCP-1 and had no effect of IL-10 secretion. We show for the first time that OAS1, 2 and 3 restrict intracellular pathogenic mycobacterial replication and enhance pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion."

Clinical data are limited in these settings.
Objectives
To evaluate indications, safety, tolerability and long-term outcomes of dalbavancin-treated patients. Patients and methods Our multicenter, retrospective study includes patients who received dalbavancin in Austria from September 2016 to March 2018. 90-day outcomes and tolerability were determined.
Results
A total of 101 patients were included in 3 centers (57% male, median age 65 years). The treated infections were PJI (31%), osteomyelitis (29%), endocarditis (25%) and acute bacterial skin and soft tissue infections (12%). Concomitant use of other antimicrobial substances was common (63%). The mean total cumulative dose of dalbavancin was 3,357mg (±2,283mg). Clinical success rate was 89%. Side effects occurred in 3/101 patients.
Conclusion
In this real-life study dalbavancin was primarily used in off-label indications for treatment of PJI, osteomyelitis and endocarditis. Success rate was high (89%), tolerability and safety were excellent in this setting. Dalbavancin may therefore be used in these off-label indications as alternative treatment approach."

To determine potential associations of the rs2296651 variant (c.800C>T, S267F) of NTCP with HBV and HBV plus concomitant HDV infection as well as with the progression of related liver diseases.
Methods
The S267F variant was genotyped by DNA sequencing in 620 HBV-infected patients and 214 healthy controls (HCs). Among the patients, 450 individuals were tested for HDV by a nested PCR assay. Logistic regression was applied to examine the association.
Results
The S267F variant was found more frequently among HCs (16%) compared to HBV-infected (6%) and HBV-HDV co-infected patients (3%) (HBV patients vs HC: OR=0.32, P=0.00002 and HDV patients vs. HC: OR=0.17, P=0.018). The frequency of S267F variant was inversely correlated with CHB, LC or HCC patients compared with HCs (OR=0.31, P=0.001; OR=0.32, P=0.013; OR=0.34, P=0.002, respectively). S267F variant was also associated with decreased risk of the development of advanced liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Child B and C vs. Child A, OR=0.26, adjusted P=0.016; BCLC B,C,D vs. BCLC A, OR=0.038, P=0.045, respectively). In addition, patients with the genotype CT had lower levels of AST, ALT, total and direct bilirubin as well as higher platelet counts, indicating an association with a more favorable clinical outcome.
Conclusion
The NTCP S267F variant of the SLC10A1 gene exhibits protective effects against HBV and HDV infection and is associated with a reduced risk of developing to advanced stages of LC and HCC."

abstract = "Objectives
Macrolides have been reported to be associated with improved outcomes in patients with viral pneumonia related to influenza and other viruses, possibly because of their immune-modulatory effects. Macrolides have frequently been used in patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). This study investigated the association of macrolides with 90-day mortality and MERS coronavirus (CoV) RNA clearance in critically ill patients with MERS.
Methods
This retrospective analysis of a multicenter cohort database included 14 tertiary-care hospitals in five cities in Saudi Arabia. Multivariate logistic-regression analysis was used to determine the association of macrolide therapy with 90-day mortality, and the Cox-proportional hazard model to determine the association of macrolide therapy with MERS-CoV RNA clearance.
Results
Of 349 critically ill MERS patients, 136 (39%) received macrolide therapy. Azithromycin was most commonly used (97/136; 71.3%). Macrolide therapy was commonly started before the patient arrived in the intensive care unit (ICU) (51/136; 37.5%), or on day1 in ICU (53/136; 39%). On admission to ICU, the baseline characteristics of patients who received and did not receive macrolides were similar, including demographic data and sequential organ failure assessment score. However, patients who received macrolides were more likely to be admitted with community-acquired MERS (P=0.02). Macrolide therapy was not independently associated with a significant difference in 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] :0.47–1.51; P=0.56) or MERS-CoV RNA clearance (adjusted HR: 0.88; 95% CI:0.47–1.64; P=0.68).
Conclusions
These findings indicate that macrolide therapy is not associated with a reduction in 90-day mortality or improvement in MERS-CoV RNA clearance."

Diagnosis of paradoxical tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS) is challenging and new tools are needed for early diagnosis as well as to understand the biochemical events that underlie the pathology in TB-IRIS.
Methods
Plasma samples were obtained from participants from a randomized HIV/TB treatment strategy study (AIDS Clinical Trials Group [ACTG] A5221) with (n = 26) and without TB-IRIS (n = 22) for an untargeted metabolomics pilot study by liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry. The metabolic profile of these participants was compared at the study entry and as close to the diagnosis of TB-IRIS as possible (TB-IRIS window). Molecular features with p < 0.05 and log2 fold change ≥0.58 were submitted for pathway analysis through MetaboAnalyst. We also elucidated potential metabolic signatures for TB-IRIS using a LASSO regression model.
Results
At the study entry, we showed that the arachidonic acid and glycerophospholipid metabolism were altered in the TB-IRIS group. Sphingolipid and linoleic acid metabolism were the most affected pathways during the TB-IRIS window. LASSO modeling selected a set of 8 and 7 molecular features with the potential to predict TB-IRIS at study entry and during the TB-IRIS window, respectively.
Conclusion
This study suggests that the use of plasma metabolites may distinguish HIV-TB patients with and without TB-IRIS."

abstract = "Objectives
Influenza A(H7N9) virus has emerged and resulted in human infections in Chongqing, southwestern China since 2017. This study aimed to describe the epidemiological characteristics of the first epidemic in this region.
Methods
The epidemiological data of patients were collected. Live poultry markets (LPMs), commercial poultry farms (CPFs) and backyard poultry farms (BPFs) were monitored, and poultry sources were registered. Samples derived from the patients, their close contacts, and the environments were tested for influenza A(H7N9) virus by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Genetic sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were also conducted.
Results
Since the confirmation of the first patient infected with influenza A(H7N9) virus on March 5, 2017, nine patients had been identified within four months in Chongqing. Their mean age was 45 years, 77.8% were male, 66.7% were urban residents and 55.6% were of poultry related occupation. All patients became infected after exposure to live chickens. The median time interval from initial detection of influenza A(H7N9) virus in Chongqing to the patients’ onset was 75 days. Since initial detection in February 2017, influenza A(H7N9) virus was detected in 21 (53.8%) counties within four months. The proportion of positive samples was 2.94% (337/11,451) from February 2017 to May 2018, and was higher (χ2=75.78, P<0.001) in LPMs (3.66%, 329/8979) than that in CPFs (0.41%, 5/1229) and BPFs (0.24%, 3/1243). The proportion of positive samples (34.4%, 22/64) at the premises to which the patients were exposed was significantly higher than that (5.7%, 257/4474) in premises with no patients. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the viruses isolated in Chongqing belonged to the Yangtze River Delta lineage and resembled those circulated in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces between late 2016 and early 2017.
Conclusion
Influenza A(H7N9) virus was newly introduced into Chongqing most likely between late 2016 and early 2017, which swept across half of Chongqing territory and resulted in human infections within months. The most impacted premises and population were LPMs and poultry related workers respectively in the epidemic."

Medical records of 57 children who were diagnosed with PE due to paragonimiasis and underwent surgery at Children’s Hospital of Chongqing Medical University between January 2012 and August 2018 were retrospectively reviewed.
Results
The average age of this group was 7.6 ± 3.0 years. Patients were mainly from Chongqing and Sichuan areas. ELISA for Paragonimus skrjabini in all 57 patients showed positive results. Moderate or large PE were identified in 12 and 45 patients, respectively. All patients underwent surgery either by pericardectomy or thoracoscopic surgery. Pathological exams indicated massive eosinophil infiltration in all 57 specimens. After 3–4 courses of praziquantel therapy, the clinical outcomes were satisfactory.
Conclusions
Typical endemic history, eosinophilia and multiple serous effusion raise suspicions of paragonimiasis. Once moderate to large PE is identified in patients with paragonimiasis, surgical treatment is necessary."

This study was conducted to analyzed in detail the dynamic changes and functional properties of circulating follicular CXCR5+CD8+ T cells to explore their effects on DENV2 infection.
Methods
Circulating follicular CXCR5+CD8+ T cells and cytokines were analyzed by flow cytometry in DENV2 patients at difference days after DENV2 infection. CD8+ T cells were isolated and purified from DENV2 patients, then were stimulated with NS1 peptides and TCR stimulant. After cultivation, multiple parameters were tested.
Results
(1) CXCR5+CD8+ T cells emerged after DENV2 infection, with high PD-1 expression, and were correlated with the reduction in DENV2 RNA viral loads. (2) PD-1+CXCR5+CD8+ T cells were negatively associated with disease progression. (3) Serum IFN-γ, IL-6 and IL-10 levels were increased late in the course of DENV2 infection. (4) CXCR5+CD8+ T cells from DENV2 patients exhibited increased cytotoxicity and IFN-γ and IL-10 secretion.
Conclusion
CXCR5+CD8+ T cells could play a protective role in dengue pathogenesis and may be a novel strategy for controlling DENV2 infection and vaccine development."

The direct, indirect, and bidirectional effects of these risk factors on infant neurodevelopment across the three stages were critically examined. These factors ultimately culminate in an infant phenotype that not only leads to adverse birth outcomes, but also to increased risks of neurological, cognitive, and behavioural deficits that may impact the quality of life in this high-risk population. Multiple risk factors were identified in this conceptual framework; nonetheless, based on current evidence, a key knowledge gap is the uncertainty regarding which are the most important and how exactly they interact."

MDR-TB is a major threat to global TB control. In 2015, 580,000 were treated for MDR-TB worldwide. The worldwide roll-out of GeneXpert MTB/RIF® has improved diagnosis of MDR-TB; however, in many countries laboratories are unable to assess drug resistance and clinical predictors of MDR-TB could help target suspected patients. In this study, we aimed to determine the clinical factors associated with MDR-TB in Bamako, Mali.
Methods
We performed a cross-sectional study of 214 patients with presumed MDR-TB admitted to University of Bamako Teaching Hospital, Point-G between 2007 and 2016. We calculated crude and adjusted odds ratios for MDR-TB disease diagnosis using SPSS.
Results
We found that age ≤40years (OR=2.56. 95% CI: 1.44–4.55), two courses of prior TB treatment (OR=3.25, 95% CI: 1.44–7.30), TB treatment failure (OR=3.82, 95% CI 1.82–7.79), sputum microscopy with 3+ bacilli load (OR=1.98, 95% CI: 1.13–3.48) and a history of contact with a TB patient (OR=2.48, 95% CI: 1.11–5.50) were significantly associated with confirmation of MDR-TB disease. HIV was not a risk factor for MDR-TB (aOR=0.88, 95% CI: 0.34–1.94).
Conclusion
We identified several risk factors that could be used to identify MDR-TB suspects and prioritize them for laboratory confirmation. Prospective studies are needed to understand factors associated with TB incidence and clinical outcomes of TB treatment and disease."

Methods
Data from 36 primary vaccination and 7 re-vaccination Phase I through III trials were analyzed; 7532 subjects received aIIV3 and 5198 subjects a nonadjuvanted trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3). These trials were evaluated in 2 data poolings: first-dose randomized controlled trials (FD-RCT) and revaccination trials. Spontaneously reported adverse events (AEs) from post-marketing surveillance were also analyzed.
Results
The percentages of subjects reporting AEs following vaccination were similar between aIIV3 and IIV3: 24.8% for aIIV3 vs 26.7% for IIV3 (relative risk [RR] 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87–1.01). The percentage of subjects with serious AEs was 6.7% for aIIV3 vs 7.0% for IIV3 (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.82–1.09). Percentages of subjects with AEs leading to withdrawal, hospitalizations, adverse events of special interest (AESIs), and deaths between vaccination groups were similar. There was no signal of disproportionality for AESIs associated with aIIV3 compared to IIV3 in the post-marketing database.

Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) have an important role in the appropriate utilization of antibiotics. Some of the core strategies recommended for ASPs are pre-authorization and prospective audit and feedback. In Turkey, a unique nationwide antibiotic restriction program (NARP) has been in place since 2003. The aim of this study was to measure the effect of a prospective audit and feedback strategy system along with the NARP.
Methods
A prospective quasi-experimental study was designed and implemented between March and June 2017. A computerized pre-authorization system was used as an ASP strategy to approve the antibiotics. During the baseline period, patients with intravenous (IV) antibiotic use ≥72 h were monitored without intervention. In the second period, feedback and treatment recommendations were given to attending physicians in the case of IV antibiotic use ≥72 h. The modified criteria of Kunin et al. and Gyssens et al. were followed for appropriateness of prescribing. Days of therapy (DOT) and length of stay (LOS) were calculated and compared between the two study periods.
Results
A total of 866 antibiotic episodes among 519 patients were observed. A significant reduction in systemic antibiotic consumption was observed in the intervention period (575 vs. 349 DOT per 1000 patient-days; p <  0.001). On multivariate analysis, prospective audit and feedback (odds ratio 1.5, 95% confidence interval 1.09–2.04; p = 0.011) and pre-authorization of restricted antibiotics (odds ratio 1.7; 95% confidence interval 1.2–2.31; p =  0.002) were the predictors of appropriate antimicrobial use. Mean LOS was decreased by 2.9 days (p =  0.095).
Conclusions
This study showed that the antimicrobial restriction program alone was effective, but the system should be supported by a tailored ASP, such as prospective audit and feedback."

Phylogenetic characteristics of circulating Indian dengue viruses (DENV) were analysed using partial pre-membrane (PrM) and envelope (E) sequences. An immunodominant region was analysed for mutations, and alignment with common DENV PCR primers and probes was determined.
Methods
Published Indian PrM and E DENV sequences were analysed with hitherto unpublished PrM sequences from this study site. Alignments of DENV were checked for mutations in an immunodominant region and against the commonly used PCR primers and probes.
Results
All four serotypes of DENV circulate in India. Genotype (G) GIII and GI of DENV-1 co-circulated in the south with significant PrM mutations before and after 2012. DENV-2 American genotype was first reported after which the Cosmopolitan genotype co-circulated with it in the southwest. The Cosmopolitan strain has been the only DENV-2 genotype circulating, although an Asian American genotype was recently reported. Significant mutations were found in the E region of DENV-2 strains. DENV-3 strains were GIII across the country. DENV-4 GI from the south and west has now spread across India. No significant mutations were found for DENV-3 or DENV-4. Indian strains showed mutations in an immunodominant region of the E gene and in the regions targeted by commonly used PCR primers and probes.
Conclusions
The genetic variability of Indian DENV with co-circulation of multiple genotypes suggests that genotype surveillance is crucial to determining the composition of dengue vaccines and understanding their contribution to epidemiology, virus fitness and pathogenesis. Some mutations seen in an immunodominant region of the E gene may allow these viruses to evade host immune cells. The mutations in the regions targeted by commonly used primers and probes necessitate higher degeneracy."

Methods
We analyzed data from 706 asymptomatic HIV-infected Ethiopian women initiating ART during pregnancy between February 2012 and October 2016. The outcomes evaluated were CD4 gain, CD4 normalization (CD4 count ≥750cells/mm3) and occurrence of HIV-related clinical events after twelve months of treatment.
Result
On average, CD4 count (cells/mm3) increased from 391 (95% CI: 372–409) at baseline to 523 (95% CI: 495–551) after twelve months of treatment. Rate of CD4 gain was higher among women with baseline CD4 between 350 and 499 compared to CD4 ≥500 (207 versus 6, p<0.001). But women with baseline CD4 between 350 and 499 could not catch up with women with CD4 ≥500. Women with baseline CD4 ≥500 had significantly higher likelihood of achieving CD4 normalization as compared to those with CD4 between 350 and 499 (AOR=0.32, 95% CI: 0.13–0.76). No strong evidence of differential risk in the occurrence of HIV-related clinical events.

abstract = "Background
The purpose of this study was to identify global trends in Listeria monocytogenes epidemiology using ProMED reports. ProMED is a publicly available, global outbreak reporting system that uses both informal and formal sources. In the context of Listeria, ProMED reports on atypical findings such as higher than average case counts, events from unusual sources, and multinational outbreaks.
Methods
Keywords “Listeria” and “listeriosis” were utilized in the ProMED search engine covering the years 1996–2018. Issue date, countries involved, source, suspected and confirmed case counts, and fatalities were extracted. Data unique to each event, including commentary by content experts, were evaluated. When multiple reports regarding the same outbreak or recall were obtained, the last report pertaining to that outbreak was utilized. Rates of Listeria events over time were compared using a normal approximation to the Poisson distribution; p <  0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
Results
From 1996 through 2018, 123 Listeria events were identified in the ProMED database. Eighty-one events (65%) were associated with two or more human cases (outbreak events), 13 events (11%) were associated with only one human case (sporadic cases), and 29 events (24%) were precautionary food product recalls due to the presence of bacterial contamination without associated human cases. The implicated food vehicle was identified in 69 (85%) outbreak events and in 10 (77%) sporadic case events. Listeria contaminated foods were identified in all precautionary recall events. Overall, 28 events (23%) implicated novel food vehicles/sources. Events associated with novel food vehicles increased over the study period (p <  0.02), as did international events with more than one country involved (p <  0.02). Ten reports (8%) described hospital-acquired events.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates the use of publicly available data to document Listeria epidemiological trends, particularly in settings where foodborne disease surveillance is weak or non-existent. Over the last decade, an increasing number of events have been associated with foods not traditionally recognized as vehicles for Listeria transmission, and a rise in international events was noted. Informing high-risk individuals such as pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals of safe food handling practices is warranted. To ensure timely recall of contaminated food products, open data sharing and communication across borders is critical. Changes in food production and distribution, and improved diagnostics may have contributed to the observed changes."

abstract = "Objectives
Based on pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of tigecycline (TGC), dose increases have been advocated to maximize the efficacy against pneumonia that is suspected to be due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria in an intensive care unit. This practice-based study explored the relationship between the predicted PK parameter, the ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve to the 24 h of dosing/minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC0–24/MIC or AUIC), and the clinical and microbiological outcomes in critically ill patients with pneumonia due to MDR bacteria.
Methods
We conducted a prospective cohort study of the treatment of pneumonia due to MDR bacteria in an intensive care unit. The study patients were recruited and assigned to either TGC standard dose (SD, 50 mg q12 h) or high dose (HD, 100 mg q12 h) for the treatment of pneumonia due to MDR bacteria depending on the doctors’ decisions. The relationships between the PK/PD parameters and outcomes were examined.
Results
Over the study period, 105 patients were included in the study. Whereas C1/2, Cmin, MIC and AUC were dramatically higher in the HD group than in the SD group (all P < 0.05), the Cmax and AUIC had no difference in both groups (all P > 0.05). The patients in the HD group had a higher clinical cure rate than those in the SD group (P = 0.029), but the bacterial eradication rate and survival rate of the patients in the HD group were not better than those in SD group (P = 0.279 and 0.416, respectively). The Cmax, C1/2, Cmin and AUC in the cured group were higher than those in failure group (all P < 0.05). The MICs were dramatically higher in the failure group than those in cure group (P = 0.0001), which led to significantly lower AUICs (P = 0.0001). In the ROC analysis, the areas of Cmax, C1/2, Cmin, AUC, negative-MIC and AUIC under the ROC curve were 0.64, 0.69, 0.67, 0.66, 0.73 and 0.82, respectively. The sensitivity was ascertained to be 75% and the specificity was 89% when the AUIC cut-off value was considered to be 10.12. Moreover, the sensitivity was ascertained to be 63% and the specificity was 80% when the MIC cut-off value was considered to be 1.75 mg/L.
Conclusions
The AUIC and MIC are associated with tigecycline treatment outcomes in pneumonia due to MDR bacteria, and aiming to achieve an individualized AUIC ≥ 10.12 when MIC < 1.75 mg/L could improve outcomes."

Ultraorthodox Jewish populations living in towns with good sanitary infrastructure but with conditions of crowding have been the epicenter of Shigella sonnei shigellosis outbreaks. In this study, the incidence and risk factors of S. sonnei shigellosis in children living in an ultraorthodox community were determined.
Methods
Data for the years 2000–2013 for all reported culture-proven S. sonnei shigellosis cases in children aged 0–59 months in the city of Elad were compared with data for the rest of the sub-district. Environmental factors obtained through parental interviews were evaluated for 78 incident cases of S. sonnei shigellosis and 141 community controls, matched by age, sex, and neighborhood. Conditional logistic regression models were performed.
Results
Cyclic epidemics of S. sonnei shigellosis occurred every 2 years. The mean annual incidence was 10.0 per 1000 children in Elad (95% confidence interval 7.9–12.6) vs. 3.8 per 1000 children (95% confidence interval 3.3–4.4) in the sub-district (p<0.001). Concurrent diarrheal disease in family members, having the same person in the daycare center responsible for food handling and changing diapers, and more rooms and sinks in the center, were positively associated with S. sonnei shigellosis, while children’s hand-washing before meals was inversely associated.
Conclusions
The burden of S. sonnei shigellosis in ultraorthodox communities is high. Enhanced hygiene interventions are required for epidemic control."

To determine the proportion of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB) patients who accessed second-line drug susceptibility testing (SL-DST) results following introduction of the Hain technology in southern provinces, Zimbabwe.
Design
Cohort study using secondary data.
Results
Xpert MTB/RIF results were used to identify 133 RR-TB patients for this study. Their mean age (SD) was 37.9 (11.1) years, 83 (62%) were males and 106 (80%) were HIV-infected. There were 6 (5%) participants who had pre-treatment attrition. Of the 133 pulmonary TB (PTB) patients, 117 (80%) had additional sputum specimens collected; 96 (72%) specimens reached the National TB Reference Laboratory (NTBRL); 95 (71%) were processed; 68 (51%) had SL-DST results. Only 53 (40%) SL-DST results reached the peripheral facilities. Median time from specimen reception at the NTBRL to SL-DSTs was 40 days, interquartile range (IQR: 28–67). Median time from presumptive diagnosis of RR-TB by health care worker to SL-DST results was 50days (IQR: 39–80), and increased to 79days (IQR: 39–101) in facilities >250km from the NTBRL. The proportion with any fluoroquinolone resistance was 9 (13.2%).
Conclusion
Although RR-TB patients with PTB were initiated timely on treatment, access to SL-DSTs by facilities needs improvement. Health inequities exist as remote areas are less likely to get SL-DST results in time."

Protocols for HIV care are widely accepted by all international organizations and are proven to reduce mortality and complications from living with HIV. Unfortunately, executing best practice recommendations in Sierra Leone is difficult due to shortages in staff, training, and medications.
Methods
From June 2016 to August 2016, we implemented both an HIV guideline-based clinical evaluation protocol and a patient-centered workflow for TB screening and CD4 testing in the HIV clinic at Koidu Government Hospital (KGH) in rural Sierra Leone. The primary outcome of interest was how often this service center resulted in a clinically significant change in the patients’ HIV regimen. Reasons for changing regimen included diagnosis of co-infection with tuberculosis (TB), diagnosis of clinical or presumed immunologic treatment failure of antiretroviral (ART) medications and, need for adherence to weight-based dosing in pediatric patients.
Findings
A total of 188 patients with HIV were seen in the clinic; 49 (26%) of these patients had a clinically significant change in their HIV regimen. The most common reason for regimen change was TB co-infection diagnosis in 38 (20%) patients. The other reasons for HIV regimen changes included: eight children whose ART was adjusted to meet appropriate levels for weight-based guidelines, five patients diagnosed with presumed immunologic treatment failure (some also co-infected with tuberculosis), and two patients with a serious side effect to ART. Interpretation: A comprehensive, patient-centric HIV clinic can result in high rates of case detection for tuberculosis and recognition of immunological ART failure."

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global public health problem. Recent studies have implicated long non-coding RNAs and their variants as possibly playing important roles in TB. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical relevance of lnc-AC145676.2.1-6 and lnc-TGS1-1 and their variants in a western Chinese population.
Methods
This case–control study included 467 TB patients and 473 healthy controls from West China Hospital. The expression levels of lnc-AC145676.2.1-6 and lnc-TGS1-1 were analyzed by reverse transcriptase quantitative real-time PCR. Single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping was performed using a custom-designed 2 × 48-Plex SNPscan kit.
Results
It was observed that lnc-AC145676.2.1-6 and lnc-TGS1-1 expression levels were both obviously down-regulated in TB patients. In addition, a lower expression level of lnc-TGS1-1 was associated with the presence of thrombocytopenia in TB patients during anti-TB treatment, and the homozygous CC genotype of rs4737420 correlated with a decreased risk of leukopenia, compared with individuals with the T allele (TT/CT genotype), in the dominant mode.
Conclusions
For the first time, potential TB-associated promoting effects were identified for the decreased expression levels of lnc-AC145676.2.1-6 and lnc-TGS-1, while lnc-TGS1-1 and its variant rs4737420 may be predictive indicators of anti-TB drug-induced adverse drug reactions. Larger validation studies on different populations are warranted to confirm these findings."

Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) is the most common cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in developing countries, including Haiti. Our objective was to detect pathogens found in children with ARI in rural Haiti to help develop evidence-based guidelines for treatment and prevention.
Methods
Retrospective study of students with ARI at four schools in rural Haiti. Viral and/or bacterial pathogens were identified by qPCR in 177 nasal swabs collected from April 2013 through November 2015.
Results
Most common viruses detected were Rhinovirus (36%), Influenza A (16%) and Adenovirus (7%), and bacteria were Streptococcus pneumoniae (58%) and Staphylococcus aureus (28%). Compared to older children, children aged 3–5 years had more Influenza A (28% vs. 9%, p=0.002) and Adenovirus detected (14% vs. 3%, p=0.01). Similarly, S. pneumoniae was greatest in children 3–5 years old (71% 3–5yrs; 58% 6–15 years; 25% 16–20 years; p=0.008). Children 3–10 years old presented with fever more than children 11–20 years old (22% vs 7%; p=0.02) and were more often diagnosed with pneumonia (28% vs 4%, p<0.001).
Conclusions
Younger children had increased fever, pneumonia, and detection of Influenza A and S. pneumoniae. These data support the need for influenza and pneumococcus vaccination in early childhood in Haiti."

The diagnostic value of bronchoalveolar lavage in patients with negative sputum/smear for tuberculous bacilli has been well studied. However, its value in the subset of patients with both negative sputum/smear and culture is seldom reported.
Methods
A retrospective study of patients referred for diagnostic bronchoscopy for the suspicion of pulmonary tuberculosis during the period from April 1st, 2015 to March 30th, 2016, and who had negative sputum/smear and culture for tuberculous bacilli.
Results
One hundred and ninety patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Bronchoalveolar lavage detected further 61/190 (32.1%) pulmonary tuberculosis cases. Bronchoalveolar lavage mycobacterial culture and polymerase chain reaction (positive in 60/190 (31.6%) and 58/190 (30.5%) of patients respectively) provided the highest diagnostic yield, whereas direct smear provided the lowest yield. Bronchoalveolar lavage had a sensitivity of 89.7%, a specificity of 100%, a positive predictive value of 100%, a negative predictive value of 94.6%, and a test accuracy of 96.3% in suspected pulmonary tuberculosis cases with negative sputum/smear and culture. Positive bronchoalveolar lavage yield for tuberculosis was significantly associated with a positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test, positive purified protein derivative skin test, radiological evidence of upper zone abnormality and patient’s origin being from the Indian subcontinent.
Conclusion
Bronchoalveolar lavage should be pursued as a useful diagnostic tool for suspected pulmonary tuberculosis cases when sputum/smear and culture are negative. Its value is higher in the subset of patients with positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test, positive purified protein derivative skin test, upper zone abnormality on radiograph or being from the Indian subcontinent."

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is an important component of antiretroviral therapy (ART) that has been widely used. The aim of this study was to observe the long-term impact of TDF-based ART on lipid metabolism profiles and renal functions in Chinese patients.
Methods
414 and 124 HIV-infected, ART-naïve patients who initiated TDF-based regimens and non-TDF regimens respectively were retrospectively included. Demographic characteristics and clinical information of each patient was collected. Changes of lipid profiles and renal function, as well as the risk factors of hyperlipidemia and renal dysfunction were analyzed.
Results
After 96 weeks of ART, HIV viral loads were undetectable in 97.34% (403/414) of patients exposed to TDF. The plasma total cholesterol (TCH) increased from 3.97 ± 0.83 mmol/L to 4.53 ± 0.87 mmol/L (P < 0.001), which did not show a significant difference comparing with non-TDF exposed group. By contrast, the plasma triglyceride (TG) levels increased, but were still lower than that in the non-TDF exposed group (0.26 ± 1.24 vs. 0.89 ± 1.78, P < 0.001). The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decreased from 127.29 ± 24.04ml∙min−1∙1.73 m−2 at baseline to 118.84 ± 22.74 ml∙min−1∙1.73 m−2(P < 0.001) in the TDF exposed group, while it increased in the non-TDF exposed group. In the TDF group, high body mass index (BMI) (OR = 1.13, P = 0.01), high baseline TG (OR = 2.33, P<0.001) and receiving protease inhibitors (PIs) (OR = 7.58, P < 0.001) were associated with hypertriglyceridemia after ART, while high baseline TCH predicted hypercholesterolemia (OR = 3.58, P < 0.001). MSM (OR = 0.22, P = 0.02) and baseline eGFR (OR = 0.90, P < 0.001) was associated with renal dysfunction after ART.
Conclusions
TDF-based regimens are of good therapeutic effect among Chinese people. These regimens showed a better plasma lipid profile but mild renal dysfunction as compared to non-TDF based regimens. Patients with high BMI, high baseline TG, high baseline TCH and low baseline eGFR should be closely monitored when using TDF-based ART."

The cytochrome P450 CYP2B6*6 (CYP2B6 c.516G>T; rs3745274) is one of the genetic factors that alters the drug metabolism in antimalarial, antiretroviral and TB first-line drugs. In Central African populations, the distribution of the CYP2B6*6 variant is poorly documented. This study investigated the distribution of CYP2B6 c.516G>T variant among Congolese individuals.
Methods
A total of 418 patients with HIV-1 mono-infection, HIV-1 and Tuberculosis coinfection and symptomatic P. falciparum malaria were genotyped for the CYP2B6 c.516G>T SNP using Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP). The allele frequencies and genotype distributions were determined.
Results
The CYP2B6 c.516G>T was successfully analysed in 69% (288/418) of the study participants. Among the investigated individuals, the distribution of the major allele CYP2B6*G was 45% and the minor CYP2B6*T allele was 55%. Significant differences in genotype distribution were also observed among the studied individuals. The CYP2B6*GG (rapid metabolizer) genotype was observed in 17% (49/288) followed by CYP2B6*GT (intermediate metabolizer) 55% (159/288) and CYP2B6*TT (poor metabolizers) 28% (80/288).
Conclusion
This study contributes to increasing understanding on population pharmacogenetics and may help policy makers regulate treatment guidelines in the Congolese population with a high burden of HIV, Malaria and TB."

abstract = "Background
The immunological and clinical impact of trypanocidal treatment in chronic Chagas’ disease (CCD) is unclear.
Methodology and findings
Several cytokines were measured in plasma of 66 patients with CCD. Thirty-three patients had been previously treated with benznidazole and 33 had never been treated. The treated group exhibited higher levels of IL-17 (median 142.45×1.22pg/ml, P=0.025), which was the only one significantly associated with Bz treatment, especially after adjusting for time of disease and NYHA class (P=0.024; OR 1.006, 95% CI 1.001-1.010). Compared to untreated patients, the treated group exhibited higher median values of mitral annular E’ lateral (13.0×10.0cm/s, P=0.038), S’ infero-lateral (8.9×7.6cm/s, P=0.013), S’ septal (8.5×7.4cm/s, P=0.034), mean S’ (9.0×7.9cm/s, P=0.013) and tricuspid annular S’ (13.3×11.1cm/s, P=0.001) and lower values of E/E’ septal (7.2×9.5cm/s, P=0.049). After adjustment for time of disease and NYHA class, S’ infero-lateral (P=0.031), mean S’ (P=0.049) and S’ tricuspid (P=0.024) persisted as significantly associated with treatment.
Conclusion
The present findings suggest that the group of CCD patients treated with Bz displayed increased plasma levels of IL-17 and preserved myocardial function, reinforcing the idea that Bz treatment may be beneficial."

The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review to better understand the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of listeriosis patients in mainland China.
Methods
The six most widely used Chinese and English language databases were searched. The records of patients with listeriosis in mainland China reported during the years 2011–2017 were extracted. The clinical data of patients and information on clinical isolates of Listeria were collected and analyzed.
Results
In total, 136 records were identified, reporting 562 patients with listeriosis. The number of patients was much higher than that reported in the previous decade. The 227 non-perinatal listeriosis patients included had a mortality rate of 23.78%. Of the 231 perinatal listeriosis patients, 32.68% resulted in abortion and/or newborn death. All listeriosis cases were reported as being sporadic. The listeriosis was traced to infection via a meat product in only three patients, while 33.12% were healthcare-associated infections.
Conclusions
The number of patients with listeriosis in mainland China may have been underestimated previously. Perinatal cases in mainland China account for a much higher proportion than is usually described. Considering the high number of listeriosis patients in China, a comprehensive monitoring system for Listeria is urgently needed."

abstract = "Objective
To compare the clinical and epidemiological features, treatments, and outcomes of patients with isolated right-sided and left-sided fungal endocarditis and to determine the risk factors for in-hospital mortality in patients with Candida sp endocarditis.
Methods
A retrospective review of all consecutive cases of fungal endocarditis from five hospitals was performed. Clinical features were compared between patients with isolated right-sided and left-sided endocarditis. In the subgroup of fungal endocarditis due to Candida species, binary logistic regression analysis was performed to determine variables related to in-hospital mortality.
Results
Seventy-eight patients with fungal endocarditis were studied. Their median age was 50 years; 55% were male and 19 patients (24%) had isolated right-sided endocarditis. Overall, cardiac surgery was performed in 46 patients (59%), and in-hospital mortality was 54%. Compared to patients with left-side fungal endocarditis, patients with isolated right-sided endocarditis had lower mortality (32% vs. 61%; p=0.025) and were less often submitted to cardiac surgery (37% vs. 66%; p=0.024). The most frequent etiology was Candida spp (85%). In this subgroup, acute heart failure (odds ratio 5.0; p=0.027) and exclusive medical treatment (odds ratio 11.1; p=0.004) were independent predictors of in-hospital death, whereas isolated right-sided endocarditis was related to a lower risk of mortality (odds ratio 0.13; p=0.023).
Conclusions
Patients with isolated right-sided fungal endocarditis have particular clinical and epidemiological features. They were submitted to cardiac surgery less often and had better survival than patients with left-sided fungal endocarditis. Isolated right-sided endocarditis was also a marker of a less harmful illness in the subgroup of Candida sp endocarditis."

The aim of this study was to investigate brain bioelectrical activity disturbances in HCV-positive patients before and 24 weeks after interferon-free therapy (DAA), using visual (VEP) and brainstem (BAEP) evoked potentials and advanced magnetic resonance techniques.
Materials and methods
11 HCV-infected patients (6 women, 5 men, mean age 51 years old) and 30 healthy controls, sex and age-matched, were studied. Clinical neurological examinations, VEP, BAEP, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) were performed.
Results
11 patients achieved a sustained viral response, and liver fibrosis regression in APRI and in elastography were observed. The mean P100 latency was significantly shorter in HCV-patients after therapy compared to the values before treatment (p<0.05). The mean wave BAEP V latency and I–V interpeak latency were significantly longer in the HCV-infected patients before therapy compared to HCV-patients after therapy.
Conclusions
This study confirms that treatment with DAA in patients with chronic HCV infection positively affects the bioelectrical activity of the brain. An increase in the amplitude of EP after treatment indicates an improvement in the activity of the cerebral cortex. EP examination may be a useful method of assessing the function of the nervous system before and after antiviral treatment."

This study investigated the adverse pregnancy outcomes among pregnant women with acute Rubella infections in the city of Mwanza, Tanzania.
Methods
A longitudinal study was conducted between 2014 and 2016 among pregnant women attending antenatal clinics. Women were screened for Rubella IgG and IgM antibodies using enzyme immunoassay (EIA). IgM seropositive pregnant women were followed up until the end of the pregnancy to determine Congenital Rubella Syndrome, congenital infections and other pregnancy outcomes.
Results
The median age of 685 enrolled pregnant women was 23 (IQR: 19–27) years. A total of 629(91.8%) were Rubella IgG seropositive while 61 (8.9%) were IgM seropositive. The IgM seropositivity was found to decrease significantly from first trimester to third trimester, p<0.001. Forty six (83.6%) of 55 Rubella IgM seropositive women had adverse pregnancy outcomes and 6 (10.9%) delivered neonates with CRS, making the overall incidence of CRS to be 6/685 (0.87%). First trimester IgM seropositive women had significantly higher adverse pregnancy outcomes than those in second/third trimesters (70.4% vs. 35.7, p=0.01).
Conclusion
There is one case of CRS in every 100 pregnancies necessitating additional strategies to reach a goal of elimination of CRS in developing countries."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of earlier intervention by an antimicrobial stewardship team (AST) on antimicrobial use, antimicrobial resistance rates, and the clinical outcomes, without changing the weekly intervention schedule.
Methods
A retrospective study was conducted at Fukuoka University Hospital between April 2013 and March 2016. The effects were compared among three study periods (SP): SP1 (patients receiving anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus agents and carbapenems for ≥14 days), SP2 (patients receiving specific antimicrobials for ≥14 days), and SP3 (patients receiving specific antimicrobials regardless of the duration of treatment).
Results
The timing of AST intervention was shortened from an average of 15.5days after administration in SP1 to 4.2 days in SP3. The antimicrobial use density (AUD) of carbapenems and piperacillin–tazobactam decreased significantly (SP2 vs. SP3, p<0.05), and the costs of specific antimicrobials decreased (SP1, US$ 1080000; SP2, US$ 944000; SP3, US$ 763000). The rates of carbapenem resistance among Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates showed a significant reduction from 16.2% in SP2 to 8.7% in SP3 (p<0.05). The mortality rate and length of stay did not change during the study period.
Conclusions
Earlier intervention by an AST could contribute to the proper use of antimicrobials without adversely affecting patient outcomes."

The incidence rate of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in travellers from non-endemic areas to the Americas during the ZIKV outbreak in 2016 is unknown.
Methods
Belgian adults who planned to travel to South America, Central America, and the Caribbean were recruited prospectively to study the incidence and characteristics of ZIKV. Demographic data and sera were collected at baseline. Participants were trained to collect capillary blood on filter paper (BFP). When ill during travel, the participants completed a questionnaire and they sampled BFP for post-hoc analysis. All symptomatic participants were screened for ZIKV using ZIKV-specific RT-PCR on serum or urine, or BFP, and antibody detection assays (ELISA). Follow-up sera of asymptomatic travellers, obtained at least 20 days post travel, were tested by ZIKV ELISA only. All positive ELISA results were subject to confirmation by virus neutralization testing (VNT).
Results
Forty-nine participants completed follow-up: 38 women and 11 men, with a median age of 32 years (range 19–64 years). Travel destinations were countries in South America (n=20), Central America (n=24), and the Caribbean (n=5). The total travel duration was 67.8 person-months. Illness was reported by 24 participants (49.0%). ZIKV infection was confirmed in nine cases, by RT-PCR (n=5) and by VNT (n=4). Only one of nine ZIKV cases (11.1%) was asymptomatic. The ZIKV incidence rate was 17.0% (95% confidence interval 7.8–32.2%) per month of travel.
Conclusions
The ZIKV incidence rate in adult travellers from non-endemic countries to the epidemic territories during the 2016 outbreak was high. Asymptomatic ZIKV infection was rare in this population."

abstract = "Background and aim
Chronic hepatitis C is a major global health challenge. China has the world’s largest burden of hepatitis C and related liver disease, with several groups having an increased risk of acquiring hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We undertook a systematic review in Chinese and English literature to determine the seroprevalence of anti-HCV among men who have sex with men (MSM), sex workers, people who use drugs (PWUD) and migrant workers in China.
Methods
We searched three Chinese databases (CNKI, Wanfang and Chongqing VIP Information) and four English databases (Pubmed, EMBASE, Global Health and CINAHL) for studies published between 2010 and 2015. Included were 89 studies for MSM, 112 for sex workers, 11 for migrant workers, 94 for people who inject drugs (PWID) and 67 for non-injectors. Random-effect models pooled estimates of anti-HCV seroprevalence in each population and a meta-regression model examined the relationship between anti-HCV seroprevalence and injecting drug use.
Results
The overall pooled seroprevalence of anti-HCV among MSM was 0.67% (CI 95 0.51–0.86); for sex workers 0.65% (CI 95 0.53–0.77); for migrant workers 0.48 (CI 95 0.20–0.85); for IDUs 72.41% (CI 95 68.71–75.97); among non-injectors 25.07% (CI 95 21.51%–28.80%). Our meta-regression model predicted that the seroprevalence of anti-HCV among PWID increased by 8.6% for each 10% increase seroprevalence of reporting ever having injected drugs.
Conclusions
Overall, seroprevalence of HCV infection is high among PWUD, especially those who inject. Lower HCV seroprevalence (<1%) was found among MSM, sex workers and migrant workers. Our estimates for IDU seroprevalence are higher than that from the national surveillance system, though estimates for other at-risk populations are similar."

Adult patients of HFMD might act as potential enterovirus reservoirs. As enterovirus infection will cause acute inflammatory response, identifying the association between the dysregulation of cytokines and the development and prognosis of HFMD in adult patients has vital clinical significance.
Methods
60 patients from 266 laboratory-confirmed adult HFMD cases were included in this study, with 40 healthy adult subjects serving as the controls. Social-demographic data were collected through follow-up phone calls. Serum samples were collected from the participants. Enterovirus genotype was tested by RT-PCR, and the expression of cytokines were examined according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cases were classified using the cytokine profiles with machine learning algorithm.
Results
Adult patients of HFMD presented with dysregulation of cytokines. 15 cytokines of adult patients were significantly elevated and 11 cytokines were decreased compared with those of controls. Correlation analysis showed some cytokines have positive correlation with the clinical characteristics and others have negative correlation. All of the enteroviral genotype presented cytokine dysregulation, and five cytokines were significantly different between genotypes. Using a random forest algorithm, we could classify the cytokine profiles into HFMD class and control class with a very high accuracy.
Conclusion
These findings suggested that cytokine expression was correlated with the enteroviral infection, genotype and clinical presentation. The inflammatory profiles could be developed as markers to identify HFMD cases with machine learning algorithm."

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of ex vivo liver resection and autotransplantation (ERAT) with allotransplantation in patients with end-stage hepatic alveolar echinococcosis (HAE).
Methods
From January 2008 to October 2017, 41 of 254 patients with end-stage HAE fulfilled the inclusion criteria (ERAT group, n=35; allotransplantation group, n=6). Each group was assessed for indications and short- and long-term outcomes.
Results
The intraoperative mortality was zero in both groups. Two patients died after ERAT due to intra-abdominal bleeding and acute cerebral hemorrhage. The most frequent postoperative complications were biliary complications, which occurred in six patients (14.6%). Parasite recurrence was recorded in two patients, at 16 months and 52 months after allotransplantation. The survival curve showed a longer survival time in the ERAT group than in the allotransplantation group (P=0.028). In the ERAT group, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were all 100%. In the allotransplantation group, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 100%, 83.3%, and 66.7%, respectively.
Conclusions
This appears to be the first series comparing ERAT with allotransplantation for end-stage HAE. ERAT may be a superior alternative to allotransplantation in some cases, as it requires neither an organ donor nor immunosuppressive therapy."

abstract = "Background
Since the National Action Plan for Measles Elimination 2006–2012 was released in 2006, China has entered into an era of accelerated measles elimination. Despite substantial decline, measles outbreak continued to occur mainly in a non-targeted population, in particular health workers due to occupational exposure. We investigated a measles outbreak in a Chinese medicine hospital, Beijing, in March 2018.
Methods
Descriptive analysis was performed on epidemiology of the outbreak, clinical and laboratory evaluations, vaccination status of cases, and public health response. A case-control study was also conducted to identify the associated risk factors for measles.
Results
From March 13, 2018, through March 27, 2018, a total of 11 measles cases in health workers were reported in Hospital X, Beijing. The median age of cases was 26 years (range, 21–53) and 4 (36.4%) were male. Of the 11 cases, ten had not been vaccinated or had unknown vaccination status; two occurred in emergency departments. No inpatients became infected, 141 (83.9%) of whom in affected departments were 55 years of age or older. The outbreak was confirmed by laboratory testing; the virus strain was genotype H1. The response activities included isolation of cases, and enhanced health surveillance of health workers and inpatients, particularly in affected departments. A total of 2234 doses of measles-containing vaccines (MCVs) were administered, covering 93.3% of susceptible health workers, in addition to 973 doses to the susceptible individuals in household and community. Lack of documentation of MCV vaccination before the outbreak was identified as a risk factor for measles (odd ratio: 3.333, 95% confidence interval: 1.295–8.621).
Conclusions
High coverage of outbreak response immunization activities contributed largely to limit the spread of measles and might provide an indirect protection for inpatients. 2-Dose measles-containing vaccination of personnel in healthcare settings is warranted to prevent potential nosocomial transmission of measles."

abstract = "Objectives
This paper concerns a systematic analysis of dengue illness and costs in India from 2013 to 2016. A previous study for 2006–2012 found that that projected annual number of dengue cases (5.78 million) was 282 times the officially reported number (20,474), highlighting enormous uncertainty.
Methods
This study updated primary data for India from 2012 to 2014 and synthesized the latest epidemiological and economic literature through 2018 using the country and global estimates.
Results
The first empirically-based publication of dengue costs by country (in 2016) estimated India experienced 18,618,706 symptomatic dengue cases and 1602 deaths, and cost $1.51 billion in 2013. With a combination of increased incidence, more refined methods, and better data this 2018 study raised the latest estimates to 53,210,706 cases, 22,527 deaths, and $5.71 billion economic costs for 2016, representing increases over the previous publication of 186%, 1306%, and 278%, respectively. When consistent methods and data were used to compare 2013 to 2016, the corresponding changes were only +29%, −9%, and +12%, respectively over these 3 years.
Conclusions
India’s burden of dengue is substantially greater than previously estimated. Although uncertainty intervals remain wide, these latest estimates reinforce the health and economic benefits that India would realize if dengue were substantially controlled."

abstract = "Objectives
Our main objective was to estimate population based dengue incidence estimates in children with fever >3 days.
Methods
The study used the ‘National Surveillance System for Enteric Fever in India’ (NSSEFI) cohort at the Vellore site. Children aged 6 months to 14 years from a peri-urban setting in Vellore were followed up for a year for the presence of fever. All children who had fever >3days were eligible for blood culture to diagnose typhoid. All children that presented with fever >3days on alternate days of the week were also tested for dengue. Dengue incidence estimates were then calculated.
Results
There were 6648 children followed up with a cumulative observation period of 5800 child years. There were 11753 fever episodes with 3171 (27%) episodes lasting >3 days. Totally, 784 children with 868 episodes of fever were tested for Dengue. NS1 antigen or Dengue IgM or both were positive in 82 (9.4%) of those tested for Dengue. Dengue PCR was positive in 33/64 (51.6%) of the samples positive samples. The annual incidence rate of dengue was 49.5 per 1000 child years among children with fever >3 days.
Conclusions
There is high burden of dengue in peri-urban Vellore."

Huánuco is a central eastern region of Peru whose geography includes high forest and low jungle, as well as a mountain range that constitutes the inter-Andean valleys. It is considered a region endemic for dengue due to the many favorable conditions that facilitate transmission of the virus.
Methods
A total of 268 serum samples from patients in Huánuco, Peru with an acute febrile illness were assessed for the presence of dengue virus (DENV) via RT-PCR and NS1, IgM, and IgG ELISA during December 2015 and March 2016.
Results
DENV was detected in 25% of samples via RT-PCR, 19% of samples by NS1 antigen ELISA, and 10.5% of samples by IgM ELISA. DENV IgG was detected in 15.7% of samples by ELISA. The most frequent symptoms associated with fever across all groups were headache, myalgia, and arthralgia, with no significant difference between the four test methods
Conclusions
In this study, DENV was identified in up to 25% of the samples using the standard laboratory method. In addition, a correlation was established between the frequency of positive results and the serological tests that determine NS1, IgM, and IgG. There is an increasing need for point-of-care tests to strengthen epidemiological surveillance in Peru."

To characterize the in vitro replication fitness, viral diversity, and phylogeny of dengue viruses (DENV) isolated from Indian patients.
Methods
DENV was isolated from whole blood collected from patients by passaging in cell culture. Passage 3 viruses were used for growth kinetics in C6/36 mosquito cells. Parallel efforts also focused on the isolation of DENV RNA from plasma samples of the same patients, which were processed for next-generation sequencing.
Results
It was possible to isolate 64 clinical isolates of DENV, mostly DENV-2. Twenty-five of these were further used for growth curve analysis in vitro, which showed a wide range of replication kinetics. The highest viral titers were associated with isolates from patients with dengue with warning signs and severe dengue cases. Full genome sequences of 21 DENV isolates were obtained. Genome analysis mapped the circulating DENV-2 strains to the Cosmopolitan genotype.
Conclusions
The replication kinetics of isolates from patients with mild or severe infection did not differ significantly, but the viral titers varied by two orders of magnitude between the isolates, suggesting differences in replication fitness among the circulating DENV-2."

Cervical osteomyelitis following the treatment of pharyngeal cancer with laryngectomy and chemoradiotherapy is poorly reported.
Methods
Six cases of cervical osteomyelitis occurring over a 1-year period are described herein. These are reviewed alongside four cases reported previously in the literature.
Results
Among the total 10 cases, the average age of the patients was 58.7 years. The period between laryngectomy and the diagnosis of cervical osteomyelitis was on average 3 years and 1 month and the male to female sex ratio was 9:1. Two patients had a history of cervical fistula with an esophageal prosthesis, one had a spontaneous cervical fistula, one had a pharyngeal cutaneous fistula, and one had an esophageal prosthesis without any fistula. At the time of diagnosis, seven had a history of cervical pain (70%) and nine had a neurological deficit (90%). Seven patients (70%) underwent surgery; one (10%) was contraindicated for a general anesthetic and two (20%) died before any intervention. The indication for surgery was a neurological deficit for six patients (60%) and the requirement for lavage and debridement for two patients (20%). The average length of antimicrobial treatment was 12.7 weeks. The outcome was favorable for six patients. Four patients died.
Conclusions
Cervical osteomyelitis is a serious but rarely reported complication following the treatment of pharyngeal cancer with chemoradiotherapy and laryngectomy. Cervical pain was the first sign to appear, sometimes 1year before any other sign. Physicians should be aware of this dreaded complication, which is probably underdiagnosed and is related to an increased mortality rate."

To characterize the profile of non-AIDS-related comorbidities (NARC) in the older HIV-1-infected population and to explore the factors associated with multiple NARC.
Methods
This was a multicentre, cross-sectional study including HIV-1-infected patients aged ≥50 years, who were virologically suppressed and had been on a stable antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen for at least 6 months. A multiple regression model explored the association between demographic and clinical variables and the number of NARC.
Results
Overall, 401 patients were enrolled. The mean age of the patients was 59.3 years and 72.6% were male. The mean duration of HIV-1 infection was 12.0 years and the median exposure to ART was 10.0 years. The mean number of NARC was 2.1, and 34.7% of patients had three or more NARC. Hypercholesterolemia was the most frequent NARC (60.8%), followed by arterial hypertension (39.7%) and chronic depression/anxiety (23.9%). Arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the most frequently treated NARC (95.6% and 92.6% of cases, respectively). The linear regression analysis showed a positive relationship between age and NARC (B=0.032, 95% confidence interval 0.015–0.049; p=0.0003) and between the duration of HIV-1 infection and NARC (B=0.039, 95% confidence interval 0.017–0.059; p=0.0005).
Conclusions
A high prevalence of NARC was found, the most common being metabolic, cardiovascular, and psychological conditions. NARC rates were similar to those reported for the general population, suggesting a larger societal problem beyond HIV infection. A multidisciplinary approach is essential to reduce the burden of complex multi-morbid conditions in the HIV-1-infected population."

This study aimed to investigate HBsAg positive rates and risk factors of HBV infection among the children less than 15 years old in Yunnan province, a remote southwest part of mainland China.
Methods
Multi-stage sampling was used to randomly select study subjects from 9,360,000 individuals. Hepatitis B vaccine inoculation rate and HBsAg positive rate were investigated, and then propensity score and generalized linear mixed model (GLMMs) were applied to the case-control study.
Results
The average HBsAg positive rate was 1.81%, with 1.2% in urban areas and 2.4% in rural areas. Rate of first-dose-in-time in urban areas was 77.7%, obviously higher than 49.5% in rural areas (χ2=2811.71, P<0.01). Similarly, 3-dose completion coverage rate in urban areas was 93.7%, also higher than 79.0% in rural areas (χ2=1561.43, P<0.01). Maternal HBeAg positivity and HBsAg positivity were proved to be the main risk factors of children with HBV infection. Moreover, paternal HBeAg positivity, paternal HBsAg positivity, the absence and unknown status of HBV vaccine inoculation were risk factors of children with HBV infection as well.
Conclusion
It was very important to improve the HBV vaccine inoculation rates. Delivering babies in hospital and timely inoculation with HBV vaccine were efficient ways to prevent HBV vertical transmission."

The Indian population is facing highest dengue burden worldwide supporting an urgent need for vaccines. For vaccine introduction, evaluation and interpretation it is important to gain a critical understanding of immune memory induced by natural exposure. However, immune memory to dengue remains poorly characterized in this region.
Methods
We enumerated levels of dengue specific memory B cells (MBC), neutralizing (NT) and binding antibodies in healthy adults (n=70) from New Delhi.
Results
NT-antibodies, binding antibodies and MBC were detectable in 86%, 86.56% and 81.63% of the subjects respectively. Among the neutralizing positive subjects, 58%, 27%, 5% and 10% neutralized all four, any three, any two and any one dengue serotypes respectively. The presence of the neutralizing antibodies was associated with the presence of the MBC and binding antibodies. However, a massive interindividual variation was observed in the levels of the neutralizing antibodies (range, <1:50–1:30,264), binding antibodies (range, 1:3,000–1:134,000,) as well as the MBC (range=0.006%–5.05%).
Conclusion
These results indicate that a vast majority of the adults are immune to multiple dengue serotypes and show massive interindividual variation in neutralizing/binding antibodies and MBCs – emphasizing the importance of monitoring multiple parameters of immune memory in order to properly plan, evaluate and interpret dengue vaccines."

Paired serum samples from 802 patients with FUO were collected. Serum samples were investigated by ELISA to detect IgG and IgM antibodies against CCHFV. Sera with suspected acute infection were further investigated by RT-PCR to detect the viral RNA.
Results
IgG antibodies were detected in 12.7% of the sera from both oblasts. Acute infection was shown by IgM ELISA in four patients from Kyzylorda, with only one developing severe CCHF. Viral RNA was found by RT-PCR in the other three patients’ sera. Phylogenetic analysis of partial L and S segments revealed CCHFV genotype Asia 2 and a possible reassortment between the genotypes Asia 1/Asia 2. Animal husbandry, such as working with cattle and horses, was significantly associated with CCHFV seropositivity.

Methods
A systematic review was conducted, covering the years 2005–2017, to identify epidemiological information on IMD and Neisseria meningitidis carriers in Brazil. Documents from the Brazilian Ministry of Health and two public databases were analyzed to determine annual incidence rates, absolute numbers of diagnosed cases, serogroups identified, the relative distribution of cases per serogroup, and the case fatality rate (CFR).
Results
Sixteen studies were selected. The incidence rate ranged from 0.88 to 5.3 cases per 100000 inhabitants per year. According to secondary data, the annual incidence of IMD in 2015 was highest in males <1year old (7.1/100000). The number of diagnosed cases declined significantly over the years. In the literature, IMD showed a CFR from 20.0% to 50.0%, and a higher CFR for serogroup W (17.8%). Secondary data showed an absolute reduction in meningitis-attributable deaths between 2007 and 2015; however, the CFR remained stable (11.1% in 2007 and 8.4% in 2015). In 2015, serogroup W showed the highest CFR (24.1%), followed by serogroups C (19.2%), B (17.7%), and Y (14.3%).
Conclusions
Despite a reduction in cases, the CFR remained stable and similar in the different age groups, even for disease caused by different serogroups. The highest CFR was found to be associated with serogroup W."

Clinical illness following dengue virus infection can either be mild and self-limiting dengue fever or severe dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome, with potentially fatal consequences. A live attenuated vaccine known as Dengvaxia, developed by Sanofi, was licensed in 2015. Following this, long-term follow-up of the Sanofi phase III efficacy trial participants has revealed potential safety concerns. This vaccine, which appears to predispose dengue-naïve recipients to an increased risk of hospitalization in the future, is recommended by the World Health Organization only for adults with a history of prior dengue virus infection. A safe and efficacious dengue vaccine continues to be sought globally. India has joined these efforts in recent years, and is poised to initiate the clinical development of two candidates in the near future, one licensed from abroad and the other developed indigenously.

The structural protein C/prM/E genes of viruses isolated from local residents or Burmese travelers were sequenced followed by mutation, phylogenetic, homologous recombination, molecular clock and demographic reconstruction analysis.
Results
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all of the strains were classified as three cluster of DENV-1. Cluster 1, 2 and 3 were most similar to China Guangzhou 2011, China Hubei 2014 and Laos 2008 strain, respectively. Among 236 base mutations, 31 caused nonsynonymous mutations when compared with the DENV-1SS. No homologous recombination signal was discovered. The structural protein of these strains had similar three-dimensional structure. Only site 434 showed differences among five predicted protein binding sites. Molecular clock phylogenetic and demographic reconstruction analysis showed that DENV-1 became highly diversified in 1972 followed by a slightly decreased period until 2017.
Conclusions
Dengue isolated strains show diversification between Burma and China. Amino acid substitution (I440T) may lead to weakened virulence of the epidemic strains. DENV-1 became highly diversified in 1972 followed by a slightly decreased period."

Controlled human infection models (CHIM) have been used in vaccine development to up-select and down-select potential vaccine candidates and to provide proof of vaccine efficacy, and have also been used as a basis for licensure of vaccines for cholera and typhoid by regulatory agencies.
CHIM in dengue vaccines development
Dengue fever results in ∼400 million infections a year and is of significant health concern especially in India. There are currently no antivirals for the disease and the only licensed vaccine for dengue is not widely used owing to safety concerns. Controlled dengue human challenge models (DHCM) are currently being used to assess the efficacy of vaccines in development for dengue.
Dengue CHIM in India
Conducting CHIM studies in India especially for evaluation of dengue vaccine candidates will be hugely beneficial as the disease is endemic to India and hence the effect of pre-exposure to the virus on vaccine safety and efficacy can be established. However, to date no CHIM studies have been conducted in India and there is a need to educate ethics committee members, policy makers and the public on the importance of such studies and what they entail."

Clostridium Difficile Infections (CDIs) have been increasing both in incidence and in severity, representing a big public health concern.
Aim
The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a recently implemented Critical Pathway (CP) focused on patients with CDI in an Italian Teaching Hospital.
Methods
The CP implementation consisted of intervention aimed to faster diagnosis and appropriateness in admission and discharge point of care; activation of a multidisciplinary team; staff training; information to patients and caregivers. In a pre-post retrospective observational study, volume, process and outcome indicators were analyzed.
Findings
A total of 228 patients (128 in 2013 and 100 in 2016) were included. A decrease in the absolute number of access to the Emergency Department (p=0.02) and an increase in hospitalization in more appropriate ward (ie gastroenterology ward, p<0.001) were found. The median hospital length of stay decreased from 20.5 (12.5–31) days in 2013 to 16.5 (7–31) days in 2016 (p=0.05). With regards to outcome indicators, an increase of discharge to home and a decrease of discharge to long term facilities were showed (p=0.01 both). Despite a reduction, no statically significant differences in mortality between 2013 and 2016 were revealed by the analysis.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we found quality improvement in patient hospital management. Our experience confirms that the implementation of the CP increases the appropriateness in hospital quality of care."

The West Africa Ebola epidemic of 2014–2016 was the largest Ebola outbreak on record, and thousands of individuals were involved in the response, including local and national governments, as well as numerous philanthropic and other non-governmental organizations. A number of after-action reports and other reviews of the global response to the epidemic routinely pointed out key challenges, including gaps in operational research.
Methods
To determine the extent to which operational research studies were conducted during the 2014–2016 West Africa Ebola epidemic, a quantitative analysis of the literature published during and immediately after the epidemic was conducted. The goal was to identify the proportion of all Ebola-related publications released regarding the epidemic that addressed operational aspects of the response. It was also sought to describe, at a general level, the sorts of studies that were published during the epidemic, with the goal of increasing understanding of whether additional efforts are needed to encourage the conduct and dissemination of operational studies during future public health crises.
Results
Among the 3681 publications on Ebola published between the World Health Organization announcement of the Ebola outbreak in March 2014 and the end of 2017, 109 (3%) were determined to be operational research publications. Among these, 64 (58%) were published after the World Health Organization initially declared the outbreak over on January 14, 2016, reflecting the time delay of sharing operational lessons with the broader preparedness and response community.
Discussion
Improved sharing of firsthand, operational knowledge from practitioners who respond to outbreaks is critical for improving preparedness activities and informing the development of sound, effective policies that support ongoing and future preparedness efforts. Based on the results from this review, we propose several policy and programmatic innovations that could facilitate knowledge sharing during future outbreaks."

abstract = "Background
Antibiotic resistance (ABR) is a worldwide problem and Bangladesh is a major contributor to this owing to its poor healthcare standards, along with the misuse and overuse of antibiotics. This systematic review was conducted to summarize the present scenario of ABR in Bangladesh, to identify gaps in surveillance, and to provide recommendations based on the findings.
Methods
Google Scholar, PubMed, and Bangladesh Journals Online were searched using relevant keywords to identify articles related to ABR in Bangladesh published between 2004 and 2018. Inclusion or exclusion was based on a predefined set of criteria. The resistance of a bacterium to a given drug was presented as the median resistance (MR) and interquartile range (IQR).
Results
Forty-six articles were included in this systematic review. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by disk diffusion method in 82.6% of studies, while the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines were followed in 78.3%. Data regarding the susceptibility testing method, guidelines for interpretation, and source of infection (hospital/community) were absent in 10.9%, 19.6%, and 73.9% of the studies, respectively. A high prevalence of resistance was detected in most tested pathogens, and many of the common first-line drugs were mostly ineffective. Resistance to carbapenems was low in most cases. The presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms was indicated by the high resistance to beta-lactams. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was identified in four studies. Three studies reported vancomycin susceptibility of enterococci, and the median susceptibility was 100%. Streptococcus pneumoniae exhibited high susceptibility to penicillin (MR 4%). Resistance data were available from only six out of the 64 districts of Bangladesh.
Conclusions
A high prevalence of resistance to most antibiotics was detected, along with major gaps in surveillance and information gaps in the methodological data of the studies (susceptibility testing method, guidelines for susceptibility interpretation, source of infection). Based on the findings, we recommend appropriate initiatives to monitor and control the use of antibiotics, as well as nationwide surveillance following standardized methodologies."

Data about the relationship between chest radiographs and sputum bacillary load, with treatment outcomes, in patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) from HIV/TB endemic settings are limited.
Methods
Available chest radiographs from 97 South African XDR-TB patients, at the time of diagnosis, were evaluated by two independent readers using a validated scoring system. Chest radiograph findings were correlated with baseline sputum bacillary load (smear-grade and culture time-to-positive in MGIT), and prospectively ascertained clinical outcomes (culture conversion and all-cause mortality).
Results
Radiographic bilateral lung disease was present in 75/97 (77%). In the multivariate analysis only a higher total radiographic score (95% CI) was associated with higher likelihood of death [1.16 (1.05–1.28) p=0.003], and failure to culture convert [0.85 (0.74–0.97) p=0.02]. However, when restricting analyses to HIV-infected patients, disease extent, cavitation, and total radiographic scores were not associated with mortality or culture-conversion. Finally, cavitary, disease extent, and total radiographic scores all positively correlated with bacterial load (culture time-to-positive).
Conclusions
In endemic settings, XDR-TB radiological disease extent scores are associated with adverse clinical outcomes, including mortality, in HIV uninfected persons. These data may have implications for clinical and programmatic decision-making and for evaluation of new regimens in clinical trials."

Encephalitozoon spp. and Enterocytozoon bieneusi are intracellular parasitic fungi from the phylum Microsporidia, which initially localize to the intestine. As opportunistic pathogens, Encephalitozoon spp. in particular can disseminate to the respiratory tract, among other locations. Patients on life-long immunosuppression are at higher risk of such infections, mostly symptomatic.
Methods
Sputum samples and bronchial washings from 72 renal transplant recipients and 105 patients with various respiratory diseases were screened for Encephalitozoon spp. and E. bieneusi by microscopic examination and genus-specific nested PCR followed by genotyping.
Results
A total of 8.3% (6/72) of immunosuppressed renal transplant recipients and 1.9% (2/105) of patients with various respiratory diseases, both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed, were positive for respiratory microsporidial infection. All six transplant recipients were Encephalitozoon cuniculi-positive by PCR/sequencing and five of them suffered from respiratory symptoms. The presence of microsporidial spores was also confirmed microscopically in three of the transplant recipients. Of the two immunocompetent patients with various respiratory diseases, one had an E. cuniculi infection, while the second had an E. bieneusi infection.
Conclusions
Life-long immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients increases the risk of respiratory infection by E. cuniculi. Microsporidia should be screened in respiratory samples of these patients, particularly when they have respiratory symptoms."

Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging tick-borne infectious disease caused by severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV). The seroprevalence of anti-SFTSV antibodies specific to SFTSV (IgG or IgM) has been investigated in different animal hosts in many epidemiological studies, but no systematic estimation of seroprevalence has yet been performed. Hence, this meta-analysis was conducted in order to obtain a more comprehensive result to clarify the prevalence of SFTSV in animals.
Methods
A search for all relevant articles was conducted in the major national and international electronic databases up to August 2018. Data on seroprevalence of SFTSV antibodies (IgM and IgG) were extracted as the primary outcome. The pooled seroprevalence rates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were determined.
Results
Overall, anti-SFTSV antibodies (IgG or IgM) were detected in 15 animal species. The pooled seroprevalence of anti-SFTSV antibodies was 45.70% in goats and sheep, 36.70% in cattle, 29.50% in dogs, 9.60% in chickens, 3.20% in rodents, and 3.20% in pigs. The seroprevalence of SFTSV in animals that had a confined range was significantly lower than that in free-range animals. SFTSV RNA was detected in 11 animal species, with a carriage rate varying from 0.23% to 26.31%.
Conclusions
SFTSV has a wide spectrum of animal hosts, including domestic and wild animals. The prevalence of SFTSV is high among specific animal species."

Banna virus (BAV) is classified in the genus Seadornavirus within the Reoviridae family and considered to be an emerging pathogen. We aimed to develop a rapid and simple molecular detection approach for all BAV subgroups in isothermal conditions.
Method
A set of six specific primers was designed to target the segment 12 of BAV, and the reverse transcription-loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay was developed and compared with conventional RT-PCR method.
Results
The amplification of the RT-LAMP assay can be obtained within 40min at 65°C. The results from specificity showed that only target BAVs RNA including genotypes A, B and C were amplified and the assay demonstrated a sensitivity of 3.6×10−2PFU/mL, which was higher than conventional RT-PCR measurement. A good reliability for the assay was presented in the further evaluation for BAVs RNA from serial diluted BAV-spiked serum and 47 pools of field mosquito samples.
Conclusions
Our findings present a rapid, sensitive and specific RT-LAMP assay that can be applied for BAV detection in clinical or field samples in the future."

abstract = "Background
Diarrhea causes significant morbidity and mortality among children worldwide. Regions most affected by diarrhea include Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, where antibiotics are in common use and can make children more vulnerable to Clostridium difficile and pathogens that are not affected by these drugs. Indeed, C. difficile is a major diarrhea-associated pathogen and poses a significant threat to vulnerable and immunocompromised populations. Yet, little is known about the role and epidemiology of C. difficile in diarrhea-associated illness among young children. As a result, C. difficile is often neglected in regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa that are most impacted by childhood diarrhea. The purpose of this study was to establish the frequency of C. difficile in young children (<5 years) with diarrhea.
Methods
Children presenting with diarrhea at a national hospital in Kenya from 2015 to 2018 were enrolled consecutively. Following informed consent by a parent or legal guardian, stool samples were obtained from the children and demographic data were collected. The stools were examined for the presence of four common pathogens known to cause diarrhea: C. difficile, rotavirus, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Giardia lamblia. C. difficile was verified by toxigenic culture and PCR. The presence of C. parvum and/or G. lamblia was determined using the ImmunoCard STAT! Crypto/Giardia Rapid assay. Rotavirus was detected by ELISA.
Results
The study population comprised 157 children; 62.4% were male and 37.6% were female and their average age was 12.4 months. Of the 157 stool specimens investigated, 37.6% were positive for C. difficile, 33.8% for rotavirus, 5.1% for Cryptosporidium, and 5.1% for Giardia. PCR analysis identified at least one of the C. difficile-specific - genes (tcdA, tcdB, or tcdC). Further, 57.6% of the stools had C. difficile colonies bearing a frame-shift deletion in the tcdC gene, a mutation associated with increased toxin production. The frequency of C. difficile was 32.6% in children ≤12 months old and increased to 46.6% in children 12–24 months old.
Conclusions
In Kenyan children presenting with diarrhea, C. difficile is more prevalent than rotavirus or Cryptosporidium, two leading causes of childhood diarrhea. These findings underscore the need to better understand the role of C. difficile in children with diarrhea, especially in areas with antibiotic overuse. Understanding C. difficile epidemiology and its relationship to co-infecting pathogens among African children with diarrhea will help in devising ways of reducing diarrhea-associated illness."

To describe the pre-diagnosis and pre-treatment loss to follow-up (LTFU) in the tuberculosis (TB) care cascade in Guruve (2015–16), a rural district in Zimbabwe.
Design
Guruve has 19 rural health centres (RHCs) and one district hospital. In this cohort study, persons ≥15 years of age with presumptive pulmonary TB were tracked from the facility presumptive TB registers to the laboratory registers; if laboratory diagnosed, they were tracked to the district TB register (contains details of all TB patients registered for treatment). Each patient was tracked for 90days after registration as presumptive TB and for 90days after laboratory diagnosis. Environmental health technicians transported sputum specimens from the health facilities to the laboratories (n=3).
Results
Of 2974 persons with presumptive TB, pre-diagnosis LTFU occurred in 575 (19%, 95% confidence interval 18–21%). Associated factors included registration at a RHC, at a facility more than 2km from the laboratory, and absence of an environmental health technician. Of 162 laboratory diagnosed pulmonary TB patients, pre-treatment LTFU occurred in 19 (12%, 95% confidence interval 8–18%).
Conclusions
The presumptive TB register was helpful to assess the pre-diagnosis gaps beginning from presumption. Pre-diagnosis LTFU can be reduced by placement of an environmental health technician at all facilities."

With the development of the automated treponemal test, new syphilis serodiagnosis algorithms, reverse algorithm, and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) algorithm have been recommended recently. We investigated the efficacy of an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) as an initial screening test in the reverse and ECDC algorithms.
Methods
Samples from 4,771 subjects were included in this study. We performed rapid plasma reagin (RPR), ECLIA, and Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) according to these three algorithms. The fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed (FTA-ABS) test was additionally applied for discordant cases between the RPR and ECLIA results. The FTA-ABS results and the consensus of three algorithms were considered a gold standard.
Results
A total of 208 subjects were diagnosed with syphilis. The traditional algorithm had a sensitivity of 25.96%, specificity of 100%, and accuracy of 96.77%. Both the reverse and ECDC algorithms showed the same diagnostic performance, sensitivity of 95.19%, specificity of 99.96%, and accuracy of 99.75%.

PrEP is however not yet widely available in South East Asia. Awareness of PrEP among MSM in the region is very variable in different countries. While willingness of PrEP uptake is closely related to the extent of awareness, it is largely affected by factors at the individual level, e.g. financial consideration, risk perception, understanding of PrEP and convenience. Removal of social stigmata and secure data confidentiality can improve willingness of uptake. The diverse religious beliefs in South East Asia could have potential influence on PrEP uptake but there was very limited data in the region. There is no strong evidence suggesting substantial risk compensation among MSM who are on PrEP. As in other parts of the world, education on condom use to prevent other sexually transmitted diseases (STD) should be properly addressed rather than blaming PrEP as a sole cause of rise in STD among MSM."

abstract = "Background
Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) has been associated with large outbreaks among young children in the Asia-Pacific Region since 1997, including cases of severe illness and death. Severe illness is often associated with enterovirus A71 (EV-A71). Vietnam experienced a large sustained outbreak of 200000 hospitalized cases and over 200 deaths in 2011–12, the large majority occurring in southern Vietnam.
Methods
A prospective observational study was conducted in the outpatient clinics, infectious diseases wards, and paediatric intensive care units of the three main referral centres for the treatment of HFMD in southern Vietnam. Demographic data, basic laboratory parameters, and clinical data were recorded, and molecular diagnostic tests were performed.
Results
Between July 2013 and July 2015, a total of 1547 children were enrolled. Four serotypes of enterovirus A (EV-A71, Coxsackievirus (CV) A6, A10, and A16) were responsible for 1005 of 1327 diagnosed cases (75.7%). An unexpected dominance of EV-A71 was found among both inpatients and outpatients, as well as a strong association with severe illness. CV-A6 and CV-A10 emerged in Vietnam during the study period and replaced CV-A16. CV-A10 was associated with different clinical and laboratory characteristics. During admission, 119 children developed a more severe illness. It was found that children with a skin rash showed less progression of severity, but when a rash was present, a macular rash was significantly associated with an increased risk of progression.
Conclusions
This study represents the most comprehensive descriptive HFMD study from Vietnam to date. Co-circulation and replacement of different serotypes has implications for vaccine development and implementation. These findings from a severely affected country add to our understanding of the presentation, progression, and aetiology of HFMD."

Acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) surveillance in India has indicated that Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) accounts for 5-35% of AES cases annually; the etiology remains unknown in the remaining cases. We implemented comprehensive AES surveillance to identify other etiological agents of AES, with emphasis on dengue virus.
Methods
Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens were collected from patients enrolled prospectively in AES surveillance from 2014-2017 at selected sites of three high burden states of India. All samples were initially tested for JEV IgM. Specimens negative for JEV by serology were tested for IgM to scrub typhus, dengue virus (DEN), and West Nile virus; all JEV IgM-negative CSF samples were tested by PCR for S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, H. influenzae, herpes simplex virus type 1, enteroviruses and DEN.
Results
Of 10,107 AES patients, an etiology could be established in 49.2% of patients including JEV (16%), scrub typhus (16%) and DEN (5.2%) as the top three agents. Amongst the DEN positive cases (359/6892), seven (2%) were positive only for dengue virus RNA: one in serum and six in CSF.
Conclusion
Amongst the pathogens identified, dengue accounted for 5% of all AES cases and was one of the three common etiological agents. These results underscore the importance of including dengue virus in routine testing of AES cases."

Reports of USA300 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strain were still scarce in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and the relationship of USA300 MRSA to clinical infections is still controversial. The primary outcome was the incidence of MRSA infections caused by the USA300 and non-USA300 strains at a NICU in Japan.
Methods
This retrospective cohort study was conducted between November 2011 and October 2016 at Tokyo Metropolitan Children’s Medical Center in Japan. All MRSA isolated after 48h of hospitalization were included for analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using the standard USA300 strain. Genes were tested for Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) and arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME). A whole genome sequence was performed for representative isolates of USA300.
Results
In total, 109 MRSA isolates were included for analysis. PFGE classified 34 and 75 isolates of USA300 and non-USA300 MRSA, respectively. Both PVL and ACME genes were detected in USA300 and non-USA300 strains at rate of 100% (34/34) and 5.3% (4/75), respectively (P<0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of clinical diseases between USA- 300 and non-USA 300 strains.

Globally, HIV and tuberculosis (TB) are a leading cause of death if they occur as co-morbidities in affected individuals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the collaboration between TB and HIV control activities by determining the co-morbidity rate in Oromia Region, Ethiopia, during the period 2009–2015.
Methods
A retrospective health facility-based study was conducted. Data were collected from health facilities implementing the directly observed treatment short-course (DOTS) strategy in the region. A structured World Health Organization (WHO) reporting format was used as the data collection tool. Pre-antiretroviral therapy (ART)/voluntary counselling and testing for HIV (VCT) and TB unit registers were considered as the data sources. Data were collected quarterly and analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 20. The odds ratio was used to assess statistical differences among variables.
Results
A total of 115268 TB patients were counselled and tested for HIV during the study period. Among the patients tested, 60086 (52.1%) were male, of whom 13680 (11.8%) were found to have an HIV infection. Among TB patients who were co-infected with HIV, there were slightly higher odds of HIV infection in females than in males (odds ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 1.09–1.17). Between 2009 and 2013, about 56% of TB and HIV co-morbid patients were put on co-trimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT) and 35% on ART. HIV infection occurred predominantly within the age group of 25–34 years (31%). On the other hand, 197152 HIV-infected patients were screened for TB symptoms and 8.4% were found to have active TB. The odds of having TB among males who were initially infected with HIV were higher as compared to females (odds ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 1.27–1.37).
Conclusions
The prevalence of TB and HIV co-morbidity was 11.8% at TB clinics in the region. Low proportions of co-infected patients were put on CPT and ART. Therefore, it is essential to strengthen the WHO recommended TB and HIV collaborative activities in the region to reduce the burden of co-morbidity and mortality."

A total of 4321 bacterial isolates were collected consecutively by the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program in 2015–2017 from 65 medical centers located in Western Europe (W-EUR; 21 centers in 10 nations), Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean region (E-EUR; 15 centers in 11 nations), APAC (18 centers in nine nations), and LATAM (11 centers in nine nations). Isolates were collected from lower respiratory tract specimens, and an isolate obtained from an outpatient or earlier than 48h after hospitalization was considered community-acquired. Organisms were tested for susceptibility by reference broth microdilution methods in a central laboratory.
Results
Among Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=1736), 99.9% of isolates were ceftaroline-susceptible (MIC50/90, 0.008/0.12mg/l), and ceftriaxone susceptibility (≤1mg/l) ranged from 97.4% in W-EUR to 85.3% in the APAC region. Ceftaroline was also active against Haemophilus influenzae (n=1172; MIC50/90, 0.008/0.03mg/l; 99.8%/93.9% susceptible per CLSI/EUCAST criteria) and Staphylococcus aureus (n=777; MIC50/90, 0.25/1mg/l; 97.4% susceptible). Oxacillin resistance ranged from 31.9% in the APAC region to 15.0% in E-EUR. Ceftaroline also demonstrated potent activity against Moraxella catarrhalis (n=613; MIC50/90, 0.06/0.25mg/l) and Haemophilus parainfluenzae (n=23; MIC50/90, 0.015/0.03mg/l).

We tested the in vitro susceptibility to Tedizolid and Dalbavancin of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains recovered from blood and wound cultures, and compared our results with studies conducted in the last four years. We examined whether the spa types affect the susceptibility of the different strains.
Methods
We analyzed 275 Methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains recovered from 128 blood and 147 wound samples. For each strain, we performed minimum inhibitory concentration for Tedizolid and Dalbavancin and spa typing. We also performed a non-systematic review of the worldwide literature from the last four years concerning the in vitro activity of Tedizolid and Dalbavancin using the PubMed database; results were restricted by date of publication, between January 2015 and January 2018.
Results
We found one Dalbavancin-resistant isolate (0.36%) and no resistance to Tedizolid. The minimum inhibitory concentration values were dependent in the strain source (wound vs. blood) for both antibiotics. For Dalbavancin, there was also dependence on the spa type.
Conclusion
This study indicates Tedizolid and Dalbavancin have potent in vitro activity against the prevalent S. aureus clones in Israel. Further studies should be performed in order to uncover the factors contributing to reduced susceptibility of S. aureus strains to new drugs."

Most MDR-TB patients who recover continue to suffer from functional disability due to long-term lung damage. Whilst new MDR-TB treatment regimens are becoming available, conventional drug therapies need to be complemented with host-directed therapies (HDTs) to reduce tissue damage and improve functional treatment outcomes. This viewpoint highlights recent data on biomarkers, immune cells, circulating effector molecules and genetics which could be utilised for developing personalised HDTs. Novel technologies currently used for cancer therapy which could facilitate in-depth understanding of host genetics and the microbiome in patients with MDR-TB are discussed. Against this background, personalised cell-based HDTs for adjunct MDR-TB treatment to improve clinical outcomes are proposed as a possibility for complementing standard therapy and other HDT agents. Insights into the molecular biology of the mechanisms of action of cellular HDTs may also aid to devise non-cell-based therapies targeting defined inflammatory pathway(s) in Mtb-driven immunopathology."

To assess the potential relationship between Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM-2) in Xinjiang, China.
Methods
A case–control study of consecutively included DM-2 patients and normal controls was conducted among the Uygur and Han populations in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. Blood samples were collected and KSHV seroprevalence, antibody titers, and viral load were investigated. Logistic regression analysis and multiple linear regression analysis were applied to explore determinants of the main outcome measures.
Results
A total of 324 patients with DM-2 and 376 normal controls were included. The seroprevalence of KSHV was 49.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 43.6–54.5%) for diabetic patients and 23.7% (95% CI 19.4–28.0%) for the control group. After adjusting for variables of ethnicity, sex, body mass index, occupation, educational level, marital status, age, and smoking and alcohol consumption habits, the association between DM-2 and KSHV infection still existed (odds ratio (OR) 2.94, 95% CI 2.05–4.22), and the risk of KSHV infection increased with glucose concentration (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.21–1.51). KSHV was more likely to express both the latent and lytic antigens in diabetic patients (latent: OR 3.27, 95% CI 2.25–4.75; lytic: OR 3.99, 95% CI 2.68–5.93). Antibody titers and viral load increased in patients with higher blood glucose levels (p<0.001).

Methods
The survey was conducted on 108 shellfish, 23 water samples (seawater, pipe water, and torrent water), 52 vegetables, one peach and 17 berries, 11 gastronomic preparations containing fish products and/or raw vegetables, and 28 surface swabs. Hepatitis A virus (HAV), genogroup GI, GII, and GIV norovirus (NoV), enterovirus (EV), rotavirus (RoV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), adenovirus (AdV), and bocavirus (BoV) were detected by nested (RT) PCR, real-time PCR, and sequence analysis.
Results
The most frequently detected viruses in shellfish were HAV (13%), NoV (18.5%), and EV (7.4%). Bocavirus was found in 3.7%, HEV in 0.9%, and AdV in 1.9% of the molluscs. Of the 23 water samples, 21.7% were positive for GII NoV and 4.3% for RoV and HEV genotype 3. Of the 70 vegetable samples, 2.9% were positive for NoV GI (GI.5 and GI.6), 2.9% for EV, and 1.4% for HEV. In the gastronomic preparations, only one EV (9%) was detected. No enteric viruses were detected in the berries, fruit, or swabs analyzed.
Conclusions
Molecular surveillance of water and food samples clearly demonstrated that human pathogenic viruses are widely found in aquatic environments and on vegetables, and confirmed the role of vegetables and bivalve molluscs as the main reservoirs."

Methods
Current drug injectors (injecting in the last 12 months) were recruited to participate in a sero-behavioural, cross-sectional survey using respondent-driven sampling in eight German cities during the years 2011–2014. Using multivariable logistic regression, the association between HCV status and reported detention experience was investigated.
Results
A total of 1998 participants were included in the analysis. Of these, 19.9% reported no detention experience, 28.6% short and rare experience (≤3.5 years in total, ≤3 times), 12.1% short but frequent experience, 7.1% long but rare experience, and 32.4% long and frequent experience. After correcting for HCV risk factors, the association between detention experience and HCV status remained statistically significant. By adjusting the model for intramural risk behaviours, the odds ratios of detention experience were reduced but remained significant.
Conclusions
The proportion of people who inject drugs positive for HCV increased with both frequency and duration of their detention experience. As intramural risk behaviours could not fully explain this increase, it appears that transfers between community and custody may confer additional risks."

Methods
Pregnant women (15–49 years old) who were enrolled in the antenatal care-based national HIV surveillance were included. Serological tests for HIV, HBV, HSV-2, and syphilis were done on serum/plasma samples.
Results
A total of 4887 pregnant women were included. Results showed a decline in prevalence of these STIs by 40–60% over the 10 years (2005–2014): HIV (10.5% to 5.5%), syphilis (2.5% to 1.1%), HBV (12.6% to 6.7%), and HSV-2 (47.5% to 28.5%).

Few studies on human papillomavirus (HPV) have been conducted in Mongolia. This study was performed to evaluate the prevalent HPV genotypes and their associations with cytology and demographic and behavioral characteristics in Mongolian women with cervical abnormalities.
Methods
Exfoliated cell samples of 100 women who had a previous history of cervical abnormality were collected. Cytological interpretation was conducted microscopically and HPV genotyping was performed using the Roche Linear Array test. Study questionnaires were completed.
Results
Overall, 25 HPV genotypes were detected in 47% of participants, and the most prevalent were HPV 16, 52, 58, and 33. Cytological examination revealed 12% of participants had atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), 8% had low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), 7% had high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), and 14% had squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), while 59% of women had a normal cytology. HPV 16 was the most common type among women with a normal cytology and cervical cancer. However, women with cervical abnormalities including LSIL and HSIL were predominantly infected with HPV 52. Moreover, women aged <35 years had a significantly higher risk of HPV infection than those in the other age groups (p<0.05).
Conclusions
The prevalent trend of HPV genotypes observed in this cohort differs from that reported previously in Mongolia. These data may contribute to developing an effective strategy for cervical cancer prevention in Mongolia."

abstract = "Objectives
Understanding the complexity of influenza subtype seasonality is critical to promoting a suitable vaccination program. The aim of this study was to identify and compare the seasonality and epidemiological features of seasonal influenza subtypes after the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic and to lay a foundation for further investigation into the social and environmental factors affecting seasonal influenza virus transmission.
Methods
Influenza-like illness (ILI) case surveillance was conducted in two sentinel hospitals in Pudong New Area, Shanghai between 2012 and 2018. Weekly data on ILI cases were analyzed. A time-series seasonal decomposition analysis was used to reveal the seasonality of influenza and epidemiological features among different subtypes.
Results
In total, 10977 ILI patients were enrolled of whom 2385 (21.7%) had laboratory-confirmed influenza. Compared to influenza A (16.3%), influenza B (5.4%) was less frequently detected among the ILI patients (p<0.001). Semiannual epidemic peaks were identified in four of the years during the 6-year study period, while only one annual epidemic peak was found in the other two years. An epidemic peak occurred in each winter season, and a secondary peak also occasionally occurred in summer or spring. A/H3N2 predominated in both summer and winter, while A/H1N1, B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria circulated almost exclusively in winter or spring. Two lineages of influenza B seemed to predominate in alternating years.
Conclusions
This study highlights the complexity of seasonal influenza virus activity in a subtropical region of China, presenting both semiannual and annual epidemic peaks in different years. The results of this study may provide further insight into possible improvements in the timing of influenza vaccination in Shanghai, China."

Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16) are the major causative agents of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) worldwide, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. Several strains have emerged, circulated, and faded out over time in recent decades. This study investigated the EV-A71 and CV-A16 circulating strains and replacement of genotypes/subgenotypes in Thailand during the years 2000–2017.
Methods
The complete VP1 regions of 92 enteroviruses obtained from 90 HFMD patients, one asymptomatic adult contact case, and one encephalitic case were sequenced and investigated for serotypes, genotypes, and subgenotypes using a phylogenetic analysis.
Results
The 92 enterovirus isolates were identified as 67 (72.8%) EV-A71 strains comprising subgenotypes B4, B5, C1, C2, C4a, C4b and C5, and 25 (27.2%) CV-A16 strains comprising subgenotypes B1a and B1b. Genotypic/subgenotypic replacements were evidenced during the study period. EV-A71 B5 and C4a have been the major circulating strains in Thailand for more than a decade, and CV-A16 B1a has been circulating for almost two decades.
Conclusions
This study provides chronological data on the molecular epidemiology of EV-A71 and CV-A16 subgenotypes in Thailand. Subgenotypic replacement frequently occurred with EV-A71, but not CV-A16. Monitoring for viral genetic and subgenotypic changes is important for molecular diagnosis, vaccine selection, and vaccine development."

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality among adults worldwide. However, the distribution of the etiology of CAP varies from one country to another, with limited data from rural areas.
Methods
A prospective hospital-based study on adult CAP was conducted in Leyte, Central Philippines from May 2010 to May 2012. Blood, sputum, and nasopharyngeal samples obtained from patients were used to identify pathogens using standard microbiological culture methods and PCR.
Results
Of the 535 patients enrolled, 38% were younger than 50 years old. More than half of the patients had an underlying disease, including pulmonary tuberculosis (22%). The detection rate was higher for bacteria (40%) than viruses (13%). Haemophilus influenzae (12%) was the most commonly detected bacterium and influenza virus (5%) was the most commonly detected virus. The proportion of CAP patients with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection was higher in the younger age group than in the older age group. Among CAP patients, 14% died during hospitalization, and drowsiness on admission and SpO2 <90% were independent risk factors for mortality.
Conclusions
Bacterial infections contribute substantially to the number of hospitalizations among CAP patients in rural Philippines. This study also highlights the importance of treatment of tuberculosis in reducing the burden of adult CAP in the country."

This study aimed to investigate the distinguishing ability of lymphocyte subtyping for Invasive candidiasis (IC) diagnosis and prognosis in non-neutropenic critically ill patients.
Methods
We assessed the quantitative changes in key parameters of lymphocyte subtyping at the onset of clinical signs of infection in non-neutropenic critically ill patients and their potential influence on diagnosis and outcome of IC. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.
Results
Among the 182 consecutive critically ill patients, 22 (12.1%) were in the IC group. The CD28+CD8+ T-cell counts (AUC 0.863, 95%CI 0.804–0.909, P<0.001) had greater diagnostic value for IC than other parameters had. Adding CD28+CD8+ T to Candida score significantly improved the predictive value of Candida score (P=0.039). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified CD28+CD8+ T-cell counts≤78 cells/mm3 (OR 24.544, 95%CI 6.461–93.236, P<0.001) as an independent predictor for IC diagnosis. CD28+CD8+ T-cell counts could also predict 28-day mortality. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis provided evidence that CD28+CD8+ T-cell count <144cells/mm3 (log-rank test; P=0.03) were associated with lower survival probabilities.
Conclusions
CD28+CD8+ T-cell counts play an important role in early diagnosis of IC. Low counts are associated with early mortality in non-neutropenic critically ill patients. These results suggest the potential usefulness of measuring CD28+CD8+ T-cell lymphocyte levels in the early recognition and diagnosis of IC.

abstract = "An increased Mycobacterium tuberculosis burden inside the host leads to higher demand of response proteins. This in turn results in metabolic shift and cellular stress, which is caused by the accumulation and trafficking of these proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To resolve this, cells trigger the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is mainly mediated by binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP)/glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) chaperone, and this in turn upregulates its transcription. This chaperone protein facilitates proper protein folding within the ER; however, it can also be passively secreted into the extracellular environment or be expressed on cell surfaces attached to anchor proteins and transmembrane proteins. This notion has been shown in studies on chronic inflammation, including cancer and arthritis, with the detection of BiP-specific antibodies from different sample types. The present study analysed secreted BiP from plasma samples collected from healthy participants and patients with newly diagnosed tuberculosis (TBdx), seen over the course of TB treatment at week 1 (W1), month 2 (M2), and month 6 (M6). The results revealed that during the initial TB disease and treatment period, cells are subjected to stress conditions resulting in metabolic shifts, which lead to the secretion of the intracellular UPR-mediating chaperone protein, BiP. This was indicated by mean differences between TBdx (mean 40.88ng/ml) and W1 (68.57ng/ml) in the TB participant groups. However, no difference was observed between the healthy group (mean 42.64ng/ml) and TBdx group (mean 40.88ng/ml). Analysis of paired time-point visits revealed increased BiP secretion during early TB treatment. The detection of BiP in plasma samples was found to decrease after successful TB treatment to levels comparable to those in the healthy controls. Evaluation of BiP levels in larger TB treatment studies may lead to the identification of a new target for early TB diagnosis and host-directed immunotherapy."

Results
PR developed in 26 patients (52%), with the median time to the development of PR being 30days (range 15–330 days) after the initiation of tuberculosis therapy. At initial diagnosis, age, documented acid-fast bacilli (AFB), and the cerebrospinal fluid protein level were found to differ significantly between the two groups. After multivariate analysis, age, documented AFB, and vertebral involvement were significantly associated with the development of PR.
Conclusions
PR was common in TBM patients with spinal involvement. Age, documented AFB, and musculoskeletal involvement may be predictors of PR development."

Methods
All consecutive patients who attended the emergency and outpatient departments of a private 265-bed hospital in Istanbul, Turkey with symptoms of an influenza-like illness (ILI) between January and June 2011 were included.
Results
Out of 1270 patients, 100 were tested for Streptococcus A infection and 16 (16%) were found to be positive; 36 patients were tested for respiratory syncytial virus and five were found to be positive. A rapid influenza test (chromatographic) was performed for 325 patients and 45% were found to be positive for influenza A or B. In total, 500 patients (40%) were prescribed antibiotics; these were fluoroquinolones (12%), macrolides (10%), amoxicillin–clavulanate (10%), cefuroxime (7%), and third-generation cephalosporins (3%). On multivariate analysis, antibiotic prescription was found to be decreased by the diagnosis of influenza, whereas antibiotic prescription increased with age >65years, C-reactive protein (CRP) >20mg/L, polymorphonuclear leukocytes >80%, the detection of rales on auscultation, the presence of cough, comorbidities, and having infiltrations on a X-ray.
Conclusions
The diagnosis of influenza is important for the implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programs. Each institution should implement an algorithm for the diagnosis and management of upper respiratory tract infections. Biomarkers such as CRP and procalcitonin should be used more effectively."

To genotypically characterize dengue virus (DENV) isolates among dengue-infected children from 2012–13/2014–15 outbreaks in southern India.
Methods
Children hospitalized with suspected dengue were tested for dengue RT-PCR targeting Capsid-preMembrane (C-prM) and Envelope (Env) regions. Following virologic confirmation (n=612), a representative selection of DENV isolates (n=99) were sequenced for C-prM, aligned using ClustalW and subjected to phylogenetic analysis by maximum-likelihood method in MEGA6.
Results
In 2012–13 (n=113), DENV-3 (44, 38.9%) and DENV-2 (43, 38.1%) predominated; DENV-1 (22, 19.5%) and DENV-4 (1, 0.9%) were less common. The pattern changed in 2014–15 (n=499), when DENV-1 (329, 65.7%) predominated, followed by DENV-2 (97, 21.2%), DENV-3 (36, 6.7%) and DENV-4 (10, 2.0%). Multiple-serotype co-infections occurred in 2.7% and 5.4% in 2012–13 and 2014–15, respectively. Genotype III (GIII) of DENV-1 predominated (85.7%) in 2012–13, ceding to GI predominance (80.8%) in 2014–15. Among DENV-2, 71.9% (23/32) showed distinct clustering suggesting a new lineage, ‘GIVc’. All tested DENV-4 were GIC, whose clustering pattern showed the emergence of two distinct clades.
Conclusions
New genotypic/lineage variations in DENV-1 and DENV-2 may have influenced the magnitude and severity of dengue epidemics in southern India during this period. These findings emphasize the role of active surveillance of DENV serotypes/genotypes in aiding outbreak control and vaccine studies."

Pulmonary nocardiosis (PN) is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening infection. Most of our knowledge on PN is derived from case reports and small case series. Increasing incidence rates of PN have been reported recently. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical course of and risk factors for PN in four Western European countries and to estimate population-based annual hospitalization rates.
Methods
This was a retrospective evaluation (1995–2011) of the clinical course of and risk factors for PN in patients at 11 hospitals in four European countries (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and the Netherlands). Population-based estimates of hospitalization rates for PN in Germany (2005 to 2011) were calculated using official German nationwide diagnosis-related groups (DRG) hospital statistics.
Results
Forty-three patients fulfilled stringent criteria for proven (n=8) and probable (n=35) PN; seven had extrapulmonary dissemination. For these 43 patients, the major risk factors for PN were immunocompromising (83.7%) and/or pulmonary (58.1%; as only comorbidity in 27.9%) comorbidities. The median duration of PN targeted therapy was 12 weeks. Distinctive patterns of resistance were observed (imipenem susceptibility: Nocardia farcinica 33.3%; Nocardia asteroides 66.7%). The overall mortality rate was 18.9% (50% in disseminated PN). Over time, annual PN hospitalization rates remained unchanged at around 0.04/100000, with the highest rate among men aged 75–84 years (0.24/100000).

The aim was to characterize the clinical features, outcomes, and strain diversity of laboratory-confirmed Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus, GAS) infections among inpatients hospitalized at a tertiary level hospital in Brussels, Belgium, according to the patients’ housing status (homeless vs. not homeless).
Methods
Between August 2016 and January 2018, all patients hospitalized with a laboratory-confirmed GAS infection were prospectively enrolled and risk factors were recorded. GAS strains were characterized using emm-typing and emm-clustering in both inpatients and outpatients. Analyses were performed according to homelessness status.
Results
During the study period, 48% (28/58) of adults hospitalized with a GAS infection at the tertiary hospital were homeless. The estimated incidence rate was 100 times higher for homeless persons. Skin abscesses were more frequent in the homeless group (21.4% vs. 3.3%) and mortality was high (10.7%). Limited emm-type diversity was found in this group, with four emm-types (64, 77, 83, and 101) accounting for 76.1% of the infections, and the majority of these emm-types belonged to the D4 emm-cluster. Pooled analyses of inpatient and outpatient strains indicated lower diversity in the homeless group.
Conclusions
The homeless are disproportionately affected by GAS and have a higher rate of abscesses and high mortality. The lower emm-type diversity and preferential infection with four emm-types likely reflects endemic circulation of GAS in this population. Preventive strategies are warranted in this fragile population."

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), and the baseline prevalence of LTBI among frontline TB HCWs in southeastern China remains unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of LTBI among TB HCWs and to analyze factors associated with LTBI at both the individual and institutional level.
Methods
Based on a cross-sectional study design, 31 out of 89 TB-designated hospitals in Zhejiang Province of China were selected. Information on TB infection control measures was collected through field visits to each of the selected hospitals. All TB HCWs from the selected hospitals were recruited to answer a questionnaire and to undergo LTBI testing by TB interferon gamma release assay. Univariate analyses and a generalized linear mixed model were applied to analyze factors associated with LTBI at both the individual and hospital level.
Results
A total of 487 TB HCWs were recruited at the 31 TB-designated hospitals; 33.9% of them tested positive for LTBI. At the institutional level, a low TB epidemic level, regular infection control training for HCWs, and regular maintenance of ultraviolet disinfection equipment were found to be significantly associated with a lower LTBI rate among HCWs. At the individual level, alcohol use, a greater number of years working on TB, and a longer weekly duration of contact with TB patients were identified as associated factors for LTBI among HCWs.
Conclusions
The LTBI rate among frontline TB HCWs was found to be high in southeastern China. Factors at the institutional and individual level could both affect the prevalence of LTBI among HCWs."

A total of 6263 contacts of 112 index TB cases and 6130 classmates of 112 controls were investigated. There were 14, 12, and 2 new active TB cases detected among classmates/non-roommates of index cases, classmates/roommates of index cases, and control classmates, respectively. Compared with control contacts, the adjusted relative risk (95% confidence interval (CI)) and population attributable fraction (PAF) for being a classmate/non-roommate of the index case increased the risk of active TB diagnosis to 8.44 (95% CI: 1.31–54.48) and 44.1%. The adjusted RR and PAF for being a classmate/roommate of the index case was 29.37 (95% CI: 3.80, 227.11) and 41.4%. Being classmates/roommates significantly increased the risk of TB compared to a classmate/non-roommate of the index case (RR=3.48, 95% CI: 1.64, 7.40).
Conclusion
The additional risk of TB due to exposure in the dorm room should be taken into account in planning of TB prevention and control in boarding schools."

abstract = "Objective
Hong Kong is a high-income city of China with an intermediate tuberculosis (TB) burden, and 1% of TB cases are multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB). The aim of this study was to examine the potential cost-effectiveness of adding bedaquiline or delamanid to the background regimen (BR) for the treatment of MDR-TB in Hong Kong.
Methods
A decision-analytic model was designed to simulate outcomes over a 10-year time horizon for MDR-TB patients treated with bedaquiline plus BR (B-BR), delamanid plus BR (D-BR), or BR alone. Outcome measures included direct medical costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained.
Results
In the base-case analysis, BR was the least costly regimen (USD 47396) with the lowest QALYs gained (6.347). Compared to BR, B-BR gained an additional 0.731 QALYs with incremental cost of USD 9. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of B-BR was USD 12/QALY. D-BR was more costly than BR by USD 20 164 and gained an additional 0.012 QALYs. The ICER of D-BR was USD 1 680333/QALY. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis with 10000 Monte Carlo simulations, B-BR and D-BR were cost-effective 99.98% and 5.13% of the time, respectively, using 1× gross domestic product per capita (USD 46 182) as the willingness-to-pay threshold.
Conclusions
Bedaquiline is more likely than delamanid to be cost-effective when added to BR for the treatment of MDR-TB in Hong Kong."

The confirmatory diagnosis of pleural tuberculosis (pTB) remains challenging. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of pTB patients and assess the yield of different diagnostic procedures in a low burden country with a high rate of immigrant population.
Methods
All adult patients with pTB between 2007 and 2014 were studied retrospectively.
Results
One hundred and three out of 843 patients with tuberculosis had pTB. Fifty-three (54.1%) were male, and the median age was 45years (range 18–87years). Fifty-two (50.49%) patients were immigrants. A confirmed diagnosis was reached in 16 patients (15.5%) by microbiological studies of pleural effusion. Lung involvement was demonstrated by sputum smear microscopy in 13/49 (26.5%), sputum GeneXpert MTB/RIF test in 13/20 (65%), and sputum culture in 16/37 (43.2%). High-resolution computed tomography (CT) showed lung involvement in 47.7% of the patients. The cure rate was 91.3% at the 1-year follow-up. Three patients died, all of them within the first month after diagnosis.
Conclusions
The detection of lung involvement increased by two-fold when lung CT was used; this correlated with the likelihood of finding a positive microbiological result on sputum sample testing. Pleural microbiological studies had a low diagnostic yield, and sputum could have a complementary role."

Levofloxacin and amiodarone are both known to prolong the QT interval. This study was conducted to estimate the risk of cardiac events in patients receiving concomitant levofloxacin and amiodarone.
Methods
The study included patients who were admitted to a large academic community medical center from 1/2012 to 12/2015 and received both levofloxacin and amiodarone at some point during their hospitalization. Patients received concomitant or non-concomitant levofloxacin and amiodarone during hospitalization. The primary outcome was the occurrence of cardiac events during therapy. The secondary outcome was the proportion of patients with an electrocardiogram performed before and after initiation of therapy. Odds ratios for cardiac events were calculated using a multivariable logistic regression model with and without adjusting for the study variables. The concomitant group was further evaluated for predictors of the primary outcome using multivariable logistic regression.
Results
This study included 240 patients, 164 (68.3%) of whom received concomitant levofloxacin and amiodarone. Concomitant medication therapy was associated with a greater than six-fold increased risk of cardiac events after adjusting for the study variables (Odds Ratio=6.20; 95% Confidence Interval=1.34–28.62).

Methods
This study analysed the epidemiologic features, phylogenetic characteristics and prevalence of enterovirus neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) from 2014 to 2017 in Zhejiang Province.
Results
A total of 584 samples were collected. Males accounted for 66.07% while females accounted for 33.93%. The median age was 6 years (range: 1–15 years). Cases peaked in May and August (81.17%) and 162 cases (28.93%) occurred in June. We detected 15 serotypes, some of which (E6, E9, E18 and E30) were the dominant serotypes prevalent in different years and geographical regions. Phylogenetic results revealed that all of the isolates from this study belonged to the human enterovirus B family. A total of 329 subjects sampled from a healthy population were tested for nAbs against B5, E6 and E30 in Rui’an county in 2015. The seropositive rate of E30 in each age group was significantly higher than that of the other serotypes.
Conclusion
Enterovirus-associated encephalitis pathogens circulating in Zhejiang caused sporadic aseptic meningitis in children. The level of nAbs against human enterovirus reflects the history of previous infections in different age groups. Therefore, additional surveillance sites and more precise seroprevalence studies based on these populations are required to gain better insight into the epidemiology of enterovirus-associated encephalitis in Zhejiang Province."

This study was performed to analyze the serotype distribution of Streptococcus pneumoniae causing invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children aged 5 years and under in Malaysia and to assess the antimicrobial resistance.
Methods
From 2014 to 2017, a total of 245 invasive S. pneumoniae isolates from children ≤5 years of age were received from hospitals all around Malaysia. All isolates were identified and subjected to serotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
Results
Of the 245 isolates, 117 (48.0%) were from children aged <1year, 46 (19.05%) were from children aged 1–2 years, and 82 (33.0%) were from children aged 2–5 years. The most common serotypes were 14 (26.9%), 6B (19.6%), 19A (11.8%), 6A (10.6%), and 19F (6.9%) and vaccine coverage was 88.2% for PCV13, 64.1% for PCV10, and 63.3% for PCV7. Resistance to penicillin was 0.2% for non-meningitis cases and 22.2% for meningitis cases; erythromycin resistance was reported in 42.9%, co-trimoxazole in 35.9%, and tetracycline in 42.9%.
Conclusions
Serotypes 14, 6B, 19A, 6A, and 19F were the most common serotypes isolated from children with IPD in Malaysia during this pre-vaccination era. The lack of reports on the serotype distribution has limited action for the implementation of PCV in the national immunization programme (NIP). The information from this study may benefit future policies for the introduction of PCV in the Malaysian NIP and ultimately may reduce the morbidity and mortality among children in Malaysia."

Surgical site infection (SSI) is both the most frequently studied healthcare-associated infection and the most common healthcare-associated infection in the developing world. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the relative size of this burden and to estimate the prevalence of SSI in clean and clean-contaminated surgeries in a large sample of countries in the developing world.
Methods
A systematic search of the MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and LILACS databases was conducted to identify studies providing the prevalence of SSI in elective clean and clean-contaminated surgeries in 39 countries or regions around the world. Data of interest were limited to publications from January 2000 to December 2017. Studies with information on the number of cases of SSI and number of total elective clean and clean-contaminated surgeries during the same period were included in this evaluation. Studies lacking clear definition of the total number of exposed patients were excluded.
Results
Based on the combined data from the 99 articles evaluated in this analysis, the overall prevalence of SSI in elective clean and clean-contaminated surgeries was estimated to be 6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 5–7%). This increased to 15% (95% CI 6–27%) when considering only those reports with post-discharge surveillance data. The overall prevalence of SSI in Africa/Middle East, Latin America, Asia, and China was 10% (95% CI 6–15%), 7% (95% CI 5–10%), 4% (95% CI 4–5%), and 4% (95% CI 2–6%), respectively. Significant variability in the data was confirmed by both the funnel plot and the Egger test (p=0.008).
Conclusions
Although the data are variable, it is clear that the incidence of SSI in the developing world is higher than that in the developed world."

Pap smear and high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) DNA testing are the most widely applied methods for cervical cancer screening, but both methods are limited by their low specificity and lack of association with patient prognoses. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical and prognostic significance of HPV E6/E7 mRNA as an early biomarker with cytology and HPV DNA detection in cervical cancer screening.
Methods
This study evaluated the performance of the Optimygene HR-HPV RT-qDx assay, which is an HPV E6/E7 mRNA-based assay, to detect 16 HR-HPV subtypes: HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, and 69. The clinical evaluation was conducted using 563 ThinPrep liquid-based cytology samples and the results were compared to those of cytological and histological diagnoses and HPV DNA testing.
Results
The clinical sensitivity and specificity of the Optimygene HR-HPV RT-qDx assay for the detection of high-grade lesions, according to cervical cytology, were 92.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9167–0.9972, p<0.0001) and 96.9% (95% CI 0.8632–0.9524, p<0.0001), respectively; they were 85.9% (95% CI 0.7631–0.9211, p<0.0001) and 82.5% (95% CI 0.7491–0.8825, p<0.0001), respectively, for CIN2+. This assay showed a higher specificity and positive predictive value for cytological and histological diagnosis than HPV DNA testing. Overall, the agreement between the Optimygene HR-HPV RT-qDx assay and HPV DNA testing in cytological and histological diagnosis was 87.9% (κ=0.76, 95% CI 0.7054–0.8128, p<0.0001) and 90.5% (k=0.81, 95% CI 0.7338–0.8878, p<0.0001), respectively. In this study, the most frequently detected HPV genotypes among HR-HPV-positive women were HPV 16 (37.9%), HPV 33–58 (21.5%), and HPV 18 (11.4%).
Conclusions
These findings suggest that the higher specificity and positive predictive value of the Optimygene HR-HPV RT-qDx assay are valuable for predicting insignificant HPV DNA infections among patients with a borderline cytological diagnosis. This assay could be used to prevent unnecessary biopsy procedures and the over-referral of patients with transient HPV infections, as well as reduce patient anxiety during the follow-up period."

Anthrax is caused by the spore-forming, Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus anthracis. The aim of this study was to predict the potential distribution of B. anthracis in Tanzania and produce epidemiological evidence for the management of anthrax outbreaks in the country.
Methods
The Maxent algorithm was used to predict areas at risk of anthrax outbreaks based on the occurrence and environmental data in Arusha and Kilimanjaro regions; the model was later transferred to predict the entire country. Seventy percent of the occurrence data were used to train the model, while 30% were used for model evaluation.
Results
Four regions of northern Tanzania are predicted to have a high risk for anthrax outbreaks, while the southern and western regions had low-risk areas. Soil type (56.5%), soil pH (23.7%), and isothermally (10.4%) were the most important variables for the model prediction, and the most significant soil types were solonetz, fluvisols, and lithosols.
Conclusions
A strong risk level across districts of the Tanzania mainland was identified in this study. A total of 18 districts in Tanzania Mainland are predicted to be at very high risk of an anthrax outbreak occurrence. These findings are important for policymakers to effectively mount targeted control measures for anthrax outbreaks in Tanzania."

Results
The epidemiological profile of American trypanosomiasis, which is still considered a neglected disease of the poor people of Latin America, has changed over time. A family-based study demonstrated that the blood protozoan T. cruzi can be transmitted sexually from infected males and females to naïve mates.
Conclusions
Evidence that Chagas disease can be transmitted sexually, coupled with the migration of individuals with Chagas disease to previously non-endemic countries and increased travel to endemic countries, has implications for public health. Improved screening of blood supplies and prenatal care are required to prevent congenital spread."

To assess the effectiveness of 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) against invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) due to vaccine serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae post introduction of the vaccine into the routine immunization program in Pakistan.
Methods
A matched case–control study was conducted at 16 hospitals in Sindh Province, Pakistan. Children aged <5years (eligible to receive PCV10) who presented with radiographically confirmed pneumonia and/or meningitis were enrolled as cases. PCR for the lytA gene was conducted on blood (for radiographic pneumonia) and cerebrospinal fluid (for meningitis) samples to detect S. pneumoniae. The proportion of IPD due to vaccine serotypes (including vaccine-related serogroups) was determined through serial multiplex PCR. For each case, at least five controls were enrolled from children hospitalized at the same institution, matched for age, district, and season.
Results
Of 92 IPD patients enrolled during July 2013 to March 2017, 24 (26.0%) had disease caused by vaccine serotypes. Most case (87.5% of 24) and control (66.4% of 134) children had not received any PCV10 doses. The estimated effectiveness of PCV10 against vaccine-type IPD was 72.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) −7.2% to 92.6%) with at least one dose, 78.8% (95% CI −11.9% to 96.0%) for at least two doses, and 81.9% (95% CI −55.7% to 97.9%) for all three doses of vaccine.
Conclusions
The vaccine effectiveness point estimates for PCV10 were high and increased with increasing number of doses. However, vaccine effectiveness estimates did not reach statistical significance, possibly due to low power. The findings indicate the likely impact of vaccine in reducing the burden of vaccine-type IPD if vaccine uptake can be improved."

Infection with the influenza A virus can cause severe disease and mortality. The effect of the different subtypes of influenza on morbidity and mortality is not yet known in Turkey. The aim of this study was to describe the predictors of fatality related to influenza A infection among hospitalized patients in Istanbul during the 2015–2016 influenza season, and to detail the differences between infections caused by H3N2 and H1N1.
Methods
This was a multicenter study performed by the Istanbul Respiratory Infections Study Group of The Turkish Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (KLİMİK), among patients hospitalized for influenza in Istanbul during the 2015–2016 influenza season.
Results
A total of 222 patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza during the 2015–2016 season were included in the study, of whom 25 (11.2%) died. The fatality rate was significantly higher among patients older than 65 years of age and those with chronic heart and kidney diseases (p<0.001), chronic neurological diseases (p=0.009), and malignancies (p=0.021). Thrombocyte counts were lower in those who died than in those who survived (p<0.004). The median alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine phosphokinase, and C-reactive protein levels were higher among fatal cases. In the multivariate analysis for the prediction of fatality, being >65years old (odds ratio (OR) 6.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.07–23.08, p=0.002), being infected with influenza A(H3N2) (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.27–14.38, p=0.019), and a 1-day delay in antiviral use (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.01–1.63, p=0.036) were found to be associated with an increased likelihood of fatality.
Conclusions
The case fatality rate of influenza A(H3N2) was significantly higher than that of influenza A(H1N1). Detection of the infection, allowing the opportunity for the early use of antiviral agents, was found to be important for the prevention of fatality. The vaccination should be prioritized for at-risk groups."

abstract = "Background
Immunological non-responders (INR) represent a unique category of HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy. These patients have suppressed viremia but a suboptimal increase in CD4 cell count, which might have opposing effects on functional immune reconstitution. Hence, the extent of immune reconstitution in INR patients was investigated in order to determine their susceptibility to opportunistic infections.
Methods
Twenty-three INR patients (CD4 increase <50 cells/mm3, viral load <40 copies/ml), 40 age-, sex-, and baseline CD4 count-matched responders (CD4 increase >100 cells/mm3, viral load <40 copies/ml), and 18 treatment failures defined as per the national guidelines were enrolled at 1year of antiretroviral therapy. The following examinations were performed: haemogram, phenotypic characterization by flow cytometry, and assessment of functional immune status by ELISPOT and intracellular cytokine assays.
Results
A higher percentage of INR patients had clinically symptomatic infections than the responders. CD8+ activation and innate immune parameters, including the absolute neutrophil count and natural killer (NK) cell frequency and functionality, were restored in the INR patients. They had significantly higher non-HIV antigen-specific T-cell responses and activated CD4+ cells, but significantly compromised T-cell functionality, as assessed after anti-CD3 stimulation, and lower CD31+ and CD62L+CD4+ cells.
Conclusions
INR patients showed lower thymic output, incomplete functional T-cell reconstitution, higher responses to HIV co-pathogens, and higher symptomatic events, indicating the need for close monitoring and intervention strategies to overcome their continuing immunocompromised status."

abstract = "Objectives
A mortality rate of non-human immunodeficiency virus–infected pneumocystis pneumonia (non-HIV PCP) is 30–60%. But the effectiveness of adjunctive corticosteroids with trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole has been unclear, and we examined whether it lowered risk of mortality in non-HIV PCP.
Methods
We did an observational study of adult non-HIV PCP patients from April 2010 through March 2016, using Japanese nationwide healthcare records of the Diagnostic Procedure Combination database (DPC). The risk was estimated by the time-dependent Cox regression analyses with inverse probability weights.
Result
1299 eligible non-HIV PCP patients were identified. 737 patients were severe respiratory status (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood [PaO2] ≤60mm Hg) and 562 were moderate (PaO2 >60mm Hg) at hospital admission. Among patients with severe respiratory status, the adjunctive corticosteroids was associated with lower risk of 60-day mortality (HR 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55–0.91), and significantly decreased mortality rates (24.7% vs 36.6%, P=0.006). In contrast, no significant differences were observed in the risk of 60-day mortality (HR 1.17; 95% CI, 0.73–1.86) and the mortality rate (10.9% vs 9.1%, P=0.516) among patients with moderate respiratory status.
Conclusion
The adjunctive corticosteroids were associated with lower risk of 60-day mortality in severe non-HIV PCP patients."

Evaluating the use of sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) ≥ 2 compared to quick SOFA (qSOFA) and to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in assessing 28-days mortality in medical patients with acute infection.
Methods
In total, 323 patients with verified infection were stratified in accordance to Sepsis-3. SOFA, qSOFA and SIRS were calculated using registered variables. Adverse outcome was death within 28-days of admission.
Results
In total, 190 (59%) patients had a SOFA score≥2 and the overall in-hospital mortality was 21 (6%). Scores of SOFA and qSOFA were both significantly elevated in non-survivors. SOFA showed good accuracy (Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC)=0.83, 95% CI, 0.76 - 0.90) for 28-days mortality compared with qSOFA (AUROC=0.67, 95% CI, 0.54 - 0.80) and SIRS (AUROC=0.62, 95% Cl 0.49 - 0.74). SOFA was≥2 in all patients who died, while qSOFA and SIRS was≥2 in 8 (38%) and 17 (81%) of the patients who died, respectively.

To analyze the susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates to penicillin (Pen), cefixime (Cfm), ceftriaxone (Cro), tetracycline (Tet), ciprofloxacin (Cip), azithromycin (Azm), and spectinomycin (Spt), and to verify the presence of mutations in resistance genes.
Methods
Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by Etest method on 30 N. gonorrhoeae isolates collected from the MSM (men who have sex with men) population. PCR and DNA sequencing were performed to identify mutations within the penA, mtrR, gyrA, and parC genes in intermediately resistant and fully resistant isolates.
Results
N. gonorrhoeae isolates showed intermediate or full resistance to Pen (73%), Cfm (3%), Tet (60%), Cip (37%), and Azm (13%). One isolate with resistance to Cfm presented a penicillin-binding protein 2 (PBP2) mosaic XXXIV. All isolates with intermediate or full resistance to Pen (except at PBP2 mosaic) presented a D345a in PBP2. All Cip-resistant isolates had an S91F in the gyrA gene together with mutations in the parC gene. All intermediate or fully resistant isolates to substrates of the MtrCDE efflux pump had an A39T or G45D mutation in the mtrR gene or an adenine deletion within the mtrR promoter. One isolate presented a Neisseria meningitidis-like mtrR promoter sequence.

The detailed epidemiological and molecular characterization of an outbreak of Burkholderia cepacia at a neurotrauma intensive care unit of a level 1 trauma centre is described. The stringent infection control interventions taken to successfully curb this outbreak are emphasized.
Methods
The clinical and microbiological data for those patients who had more than one blood culture that grew B. cepacia were reviewed. Bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done using automated Vitek 2 systems. Prospective surveillance, environmental sampling, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were performed for extensive source tracking. Intensive infection control measures were taken to further control the hospital spread.
Results
Out of a total 48 patients with B. cepacia bacteraemia, 15 (31%) had central line-associated blood stream infections. Two hundred and thirty-one environmental samples were collected and screened, and only two water samples grew B. cepacia with similar phenotypic characteristics. The clinical strains characterized by MLST typing were clonal. However, isolates from the water represented a novel strain type (ST-1289). Intensive terminal cleaning, disinfection of the water supply, and the augmentation of infection control activities were done to curb the outbreak. A subsequent reduction in bacteraemia cases was observed.
Conclusion
Early diagnosis and appropriate therapy, along with the rigorous implementation of essential hospital infection control practices is required for successful containment of this pathogen and to curb such an outbreak."

Methods
Thirty-four patients with penile cancer were enrolled in this study. DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples, and HPV-DNA tests and genotyping were performed. For all of the samples, in situ hybridization (ISH) was performed to locate HPV-DNA in tumor tissue. Furthermore, expression levels of p16-INK4a, mini-chromosome maintenance protein 7(mcm-7), HPV-L1, and Ki-67 were analyzed using immunohistochemical methods.
Results
HPV and high-risk (HR)-HPV were detected in 14 (41.1%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 24.6–57.7%) and 12 (35.2%; 95% CI 19.2–51.4%) cases, respectively. HPV16 was the most frequently detected HPV type. Among the HR-HPV-positive cases, a punctate HR-HPV-DNA signal pattern was detected by ISH in tumor cell nuclei. P16-INK4a was expressed in 66.7% (95% CI 42.8–90.1%) of HR-HPV-positive cases and was significantly more frequent and stronger in HR-HPV-positive cases than in HPV-negative cases. There was no significant difference in the occurrence or distribution of mcm-7 or Ki-67 expression between HPV-positive and HPV-negative cases.

The purpose of this study was to quantify the adverse effects from oral eradication therapy for melioidosis, which is usually with high dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 3–6 months.
Methods
This retrospective cohort study reviewed side effects from oral eradication therapy in patients presenting with first episode culture-confirmed melioidosis in the tropical north of Australia’s Northern Territory between 1st October 2012 and 1st January 2017.
Results
234 patients presented for the first time with culture-confirmed melioidosis. Of these, 16 (6.8%) died during the intensive phase treatment and 6 (2.6%) did not have complete treatment at Royal Darwin Hospital. Of the remaining 212 patients, 203 (95.8%) were initially prescribed trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole as oral eradication therapy, 6 (2.8%) were prescribed doxycycline and 3 (1.4%) had no eradication therapy. Of the 203 prescribed trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 61 (30.0%) experienced adverse effects, which necessitated a cessation, a change in antibiotic or reduction in dose.
Conclusions
In patients treated for melioidosis in northern Australia there are high rates of adverse effects from oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, frequently necessitating a change in therapy or a reduction in dose. Given the side effects and low rates of oral therapy completion in our region we emphasise the importance of the prior often prolonged intensive phase intravenous therapy and using weight based trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole dosing for eradication therapy."

Myanmar is listed as one of the countries with the highest burden of tuberculosis and HIV infections (TB–HIV) in the world. However, the survival rate and risk factors for mortality among TB–HIV co-infected patients in the country remain unstudied. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine these factors.
Methods
A 12-year retrospective follow-up study was conducted among 3598 TB–HIV co-infected patients (2452 male and 1146 female) aged 15 years and above, enrolled on antiretroviral therapy (ART) from July 1, 2005 to December 31, 2016. Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model. Survival rates at the beginning of ART were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method.
Results
A total of 494 (13.7%) patients died during this period. The survival rate of TB–HIV co-infected patients was 82.0% at 5 years and 58.1% at 10 years. The risk factors for mortality were being bedridden (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 2.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.13–3.42), having a low baseline CD4 count (aHR 1.53, 95% CI 1.25–1.87), and being on a second-line ART regimen (aHR 8.12, 95% CI 3.56–18.54).
Conclusions
Two out of five TB–HIV patients died within 10 years after ART initiation. Current HIV prevention and treatment programs should focus more on bedridden patients, those on second-line ART, and those with low baseline CD4 counts."

Methods
As per the laboratory protocol, suspected DF patients reporting to various hospitals where VRDLs are located, or samples from suspected DF outbreaks are investigated for the presence of NS1 antigen or IgM antibodies against dengue. The data were analyzed to describe the distribution of DF by time (month and year), place (district and state) and person (age and sex) characteristics.
Results
Between 2014–2017, VRDLs investigated 211,432 suspected DF patients, 28.4% of whom were serologically confirmed. The median age of dengue positive patients was 25 years (IQR: 16-36). Dengue positivity was significantly higher among males. The mean monthly dengue positivity ranged from 7.7% to 37%, with higher positivity reported during September and October months. VRDLs provided diagnosis to 190 suspected outbreaks.
Conclusions
The data from the VRDL network indicate dengue was the etiology in one-fourth of AFI cases. Dengue was the second commonest etiology of suspected outbreaks diagnosed by VRDLs."

Limited up-to-date evidence exists on host-related characteristics of non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) bacteraemia in high-income countries. Correlates of NTS bacteraemia in Israel were examined in this study.
Methods
A case–control study was conducted using the medical records of patients hospitalized with NTS bacteraemia in Jerusalem during 1997–2016 (n=106; 57 children, 49 adults). Two control groups were included: (1) randomly selected controls (n=101), who were patients hospitalized due to bacteraemia with other pathogens; (2) patients with salmonellosis without bacteraemia (n=112). Age-stratified logistic regression models were constructed.
Results
In children, a recent emergency room visit was associated with an increased likelihood of NTS bacteraemia. In adults, the likelihood of NTS bacteraemia versus salmonellosis increased in relation to Charlson comorbidity score (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00–1.66, for each 1-point increase in the score), while an inverse association was found with haemoglobin level (aOR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54–0.95). Steroid therapy increased the likelihood of NTS bacteraemia compared to patients with bacteraemia due to other pathogens (aOR 5.22, 95% CI 1.01–26.93).
Conclusions
In children, NTS bacteraemia was probably present at their prior emergency room visit. A high comorbidity burden increased the likelihood of bacteraemia in adults with Salmonella infection, while haemoglobin level might be protective."

Data sources
Pubmed and Cochrane Library.
Study eligibility criteria
Studies reporting at least one human bone or soft-tissue infection due to Sphingomonas paucimobilis.
Results
Ten articles describing 19 patients met the inclusion criteria. Common infections included osteomyelitis, cellulitis, and septic arthritis. Fifteen patients (78.9%) had community-acquired diseases. All patients were successfully treated with antibiotic therapy and only one (5.3%) had a residual complication.
Limitations
The study included a small sample size presenting with bone or soft-tissue infections. Some cases had lacking data.

To investigate the incidence and predictors of viraemia among individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Harare, Zimbabwe.
Methods
Children (0–19 years) and adults (>19 years) starting ART between 2013 and 2015 were followed for a median of 2.8 and 2.7 years, respectively. The incidence rates of virological failure (VF), low-level viraemia (LLV), and viral blips were assessed and the predictors of viraemia were determined using logistic and parametric survival regression analyses.
Results
A total of 630 individuals initiated ART, and 19.7% of children and 5.6% of adults did not achieve viral suppression by 12 months. Younger age and CD4 count ≤200 cells/mm3 at baseline were associated with not being virally suppressed at 12 months in adults. Among those who achieved viral suppression during the follow-up period, the incidence of VF was higher in children (4.0/100 person-years vs. 0.4/100 person-years in adults; p<0.001), as was the incidence of LLV (1.9/100 person-years vs. 0.3/100 person-years in adults; p=0.03). The incidence rate of blips was 10.9 per 100 person-years in children and 4.0 per 100 person-years in adults.
Conclusions
Children are less likely to reach viral suppression and are at higher risk of viraemia while on ART than adults. The significance of LLV and blips needs further study."

Multidrug-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MR-AB) can cause outbreaks in burn units. We aimed to study the incidence, risk factors and outcome of MR-AB infections in a burn unit (BU).
Methods
A prospective study was conducted from April to November, 2014 during an outbreak in a BU in Paris. Weekly surveillance cultures were performed to determine MR-AB colonization. MR-AB nosocomial infections, discharge or death without MR-AB infection were considered as competing events. To identify risk factors for MR-AB infection, baseline characteristics and time-dependent variables were investigated in univariate analyses using Cox models.
Results
Eighty-six patients admissions were analyzed during the study period. Among them, 15 (17%) acquired MR-AB nosocomial infection. Median time to infection was 22days (interquartile range: 10–26 days). Cumulative incidence of MR-AB infections was 15% at 28days (95% CI=8–24). Risk factors for MR-AB infection in univariate analysis were SAPS II (Hazard Ratio (HR):1.08; 95% CI:1.05–1.12; P<0.0001) and ABSI (Abbreviated Burn Severity Index) scores (HR:1.32; 95% CI:1.12–1.56; P=0.001), MR-AB colonization (HR:10.2; 95%CI:2.05–50.3; P=0.004), invasive procedures (ventilation, arterial and/or venous catheter) (P=0.0001) and ≥2 skin grafts (HR:10.2; 95% CI:1.76–59.6; P=0.010). MR-AB infection was associated with an increased risk of death (HR: 7.11; 95%CI: 1.52–33.2; P=0.013) and longer hospital stay with a median estimated increase of 10days (IQR: 6; 14).
Conclusions
Incidence of MR-AB nosocomial infection was high during this outbreak, and was associated with prolonged hospitalization and increased risk of death. High patient severity scores, prior MR-AB colonization, invasive procedures and repeated skin grafts were associated with an increased risk of nosocomial infection."

abstract = "Background
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of adjunctive urine lipopolysaccharide lipoarabinomannan (LAM) testing in hospitalized HIV-infected persons with suspected tuberculosis (TB) and a CD4 count <100cells/ml. However, the recommendation is conditional, and uptake by individual treatment programmes depends on perceived additional benefit. The aim of this study was to determine whether adjunctive LAM testing has additional clinical benefits including a reduction in healthcare-related use of resources.
Methods
A post hoc analysis was performed of a published multicentre, multi-country, randomized controlled trial that showed an approximate 20% mortality benefit in HIV-infected hospitalized patients who underwent adjunctive LAM testing as part of their diagnostic workup. In that parent study, adult HIV-infected hospitalized patients with suspected TB (n=2528) were randomly allocated to either routine diagnostics (smear microscopy, Xpert MTB/RIF, and culture; n=1271), or routine diagnostics plus adjunctive urine LAM testing (n=1257). Data were further analyzed to determine whether there were other potential benefits of LAM usage based on CD4 count and illness severity. Aspects evaluated included: (1) the reduction in number of diagnostic sputum samples tested, (2) the utilization of additional imaging, (3) disease resolution based on follow-up signs and symptoms of illness severity, and (4) the reduction in hospital readmission.
Results
Adjuvant LAM did not reduce the number of diagnostic sputum samples requested, the need for additional imaging, or the hospital readmission rate. However, adjunctive LAM was associated with a more rapid rate of disease resolution (dyspnoea) in the severely ill subgroup. Higher LAM grade (grades 4 and 5), compared to lower grade positivity (≤3), was associated with lower use of ultrasound, lower Karnofsky performance score, lower CD4 cell count, and shorter time to culture positivity.
Conclusions
Although, adjunct LAM was associated with a mortality benefit in the parent study, no benefit could be demonstrated in the secondary analysis with respect to the number of diagnostic sputum samples requested, the use of additional imaging, or hospital readmission rates. However, given the limitations of the present study, further appropriately designed studies are required to determine the effect of adjunct urine LAM on the utilization of healthcare resources."

abstract = "Objectives
Although the association between systemic infection and cardiovascular events has been identified, uncertainty remains regarding the incidence and prognosis of sepsis in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The purpose of this research was to assess the impact of sepsis on survival after first AMI.
Methods
This was a nationwide cohort study involving the analysis of data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database for the period 2000–2012, for patients with a primary diagnosis of first AMI. Among the 186112 prospective patients, sepsis was diagnosed in 13065 (7.0%). The propensity score matching technique was used to match 13065 controls to the patients with sepsis and AMI with similar baseline characteristics. Cox proportional hazards regression models, including sepsis, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and comorbidities, were performed to further evaluate the different influences on the mortality risk in patients hospitalized for first AMI.
Results
Overall, the 12-year survival rate was lower in AMI patients with sepsis than in those without sepsis (log rank p-value <0.001); this was also shown in the different age and sex groups. The AMI patients with sepsis had a longer length of hospital stay than those without sepsis (32.5days vs. 11.74 days, p<0.001). In the Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, sepsis was an independent risk factor for mortality in patients after AMI (hazard ratio 1.78; 95% confidence interval 1.72–1.83). Interventional management with PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting improved survival in both the sepsis and non-sepsis patients after first AMI.
Conclusions
In conclusion, sepsis significantly increased the mortality risk of patients after first AMI. PCI may improve the long-term survival of patients in comparison to those managed conservatively."

Ethiopia has adopted the global plan to end the epidemic of HIV/AIDS. The aim of this study was to assess the progress made towards achieving this plan.
Methods
A review and analysis of national population-based surveys, surveillance, and routine programme data was executed. The data analysis was conducted using Excel 2016 and Stata 14 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).
Results
Between 2011 and 2016, the number of HIV-related deaths dropped by 58%, while that of new HIV infections dropped by only 6%. Discriminatory attitudes declined significantly from 77.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 77.3–78.4%) in 2011 to 41.5% (95% CI 40.6–42.4%) in 2016. Around 79% of adult people living with HIV (PLHIV) were aware of their HIV status; 90% of PLHIV who were aware of their HIV status were taking antiretroviral treatment (ART) and 88% of adult PLHIV on ART had viral suppression in 2016. The proportion of people aged 15–49 years who had ever been tested for HIV and had received results increased from 39.8% (95% CI 39.2–40.4%) in 2011 to 44.8% (95% CI 44.2–45.4%) in 2016. This proportion was very low among children below age 15 years at only 6.2% (95% CI 5.9–6.5%). Among regions, HIV testing coverage varied from 13% to 72%. Female sex workers had lower coverage for HIV testing (31%) and ART (70%) than the national average in the adult population. International funding for HIV dropped from more than US$ 1.3 billion in 2010–2012 to less than US$ 800 million in 2016–2018.
Conclusions
Ethiopia is on track to achieve the targets for HIV testing, ART, viral suppression, and AIDS-related deaths, but not for reductions in new HIV infections, discriminatory attitudes, and equity. Ending the epidemic of HIV/AIDS requires a combined response, including prevention and treatment, tailored to key populations and locations, as well as increased funding."

abstract = "Objective
In rural areas of China with highly endemic for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, protective efficacy was observed in adulthood when a one-dose HBV vaccine booster was administered to high-risk children born to mothers who were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of an HBV vaccine booster in this specific group of children when given at 10 years of age.
Methods
Two potential strategies were considered: strategy 1 was a one-dose booster given if the child was negative on HBsAg screening; strategy 2 was a one-dose booster given if the child was negative on both HBsAg plus anti-HBs screening. A decision tree combined with a Markov model was developed to simulate the booster intervention process and to simulate the natural history of HBV infection in a cohort of 10-year-old children who were born to HBsAg-positive mothers. The model was calibrated based on multiple selected outcomes. Costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were measured from a societal perspective. Cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs) of the different strategies were compared in both base-case and one-way sensitivity analyses.
Results
Compared to the current practice of ‘no screening and no booster’, both strategy 1 and strategy 2 were cost-saving, with CERs estimated at US$ −6961 and US$ −6872 per QALY gained, respectively. In the one-way sensitivity analysis for strategy 1, all the CERs were found to be less than US$ −5000 per QALY gained after considering the uncertainty of all the variables, including vaccination protective efficacy, natural history, behavior, and various costs and utility weights. In a ‘worst case’ scenario (all parameter values simultaneously being at the worst), the CER of strategy 1 increased to US$ 3263 per QALY gained, which was still less than the GDP per capita of China in 2016 (US$ 8126).
Conclusions
A hepatitis B vaccine booster given to children born to HBsAg-positive mothers in rural China would be cost-effective and could be considered in HBV endemic areas."

To determine the clinical features of confirmed cases of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) and to explore the early warning indicators of death from SFTS.
Methods
A retrospective case–control study was performed at a single medical institution in Yantai. A total of 20 SFTS patients who died (death group) during January 2014 to December 2015 and another 40 age- and sex-matched SFTS patients who survived (survivor group) were identified from the case records. The differences in demographic characteristics, clinical signs and symptoms, and laboratory parameters in the early stage of disease were compared between the two groups. Conditional logistic regression was used to identify the independent risk factors for mortality in SFTS patients.
Results
Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that a disturbance of consciousness, pulse–temperature deficit, neurological signs, hemorrhagic manifestations, pulmonary infection, decreased lymphocyte percentage, high lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase levels, increased serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and C-reactive protein (CRP), hyponatremia, and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APPT) and prothrombin time were associated with mortality. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, the independent predictors of death were neurological signs (odds ratio (OR) 31.247, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.813–202.853), hemorrhagic manifestations (OR 20.251, 95% CI 2.056–199.443), disturbance of consciousness (OR 15.359, 95% CI 2.139–110.268), hyponatremia (OR 5.280, 95% CI 1.235–22.575), increased CRP (OR 2.641, 95% CI 1.090–6.396), increased serum creatinine (OR 6.776, 95% CI 1.047–43.840), and prolonged APTT (OR 6.018, 95% CI 1.450–24.975).
Conclusions
Neurological signs, hemorrhagic manifestations, disturbance of consciousness, hyponatremia, prolonged APTT, and increased CRP and serum creatinine are risk factors for death in SFTS."

Results
A total of 71 studies were included, in which a total of 8080 bacterial species were isolated from culture-positive blood samples. The pooled distribution rates of common bacterial pathogens were as follows: Staphylococcus 67.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 63.3–70.6%), Enterococcus 4.1% (95% CI 3.5–4.8%), Streptococcus 2.3% (95% CI 1.6–3.2%), Escherichia coli 7.4% (95% CI 6.4–8.7%), Klebsiella 6.5% (95% CI 5.2–8.2%), Enterobacterium 2.3% (95% CI 1.9–2.8%), Acinetobacter 1.6% (95% CI 1.3–2.0%), Pseudomonas 1.7% (95% CI 1.3–2.2%). Among the Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated, more than 60% were methicillin-resistant (MRSA). In addition, over 50% of the Gram-negative isolates, including Escherichia and Klebsiella, were resistant to the commonly used third-generation cephalosporins. Most of the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to aminoglycosides, especially amikacin.
Conclusions
It is concluded that Staphylococcus, especially coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, continues to be the principal organism responsible for neonatal septicemia in China; Enterobacteriaceae are common among the Gram-negative isolates. Significant numbers of MRSA and multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria are being isolated as pathogens responsible for neonatal septicemia in China."

Retrospective cohort study of individuals tested for HDV between 1997 and 2016 in the public healthcare system in Queensland.
Results
179 individuals recorded positive HDV serology between 1997 and 2016, with a total of 4407 individuals undergoing testing (seroprevalence 4.1%). The majority of HDV positive individuals were male and were born overseas. Those born in Africa had a higher risk ratio (RR) for HDV infection (RR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.14-2.09); being born in Asia was associated with a relatively lower risk of HDV infection (RR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.27-0.58). Positive hepatitis C virus (HCV) serology was significantly associated with positive HDV serology (RR, 2.98; 95% CI, 2.36-3.78). Of the HDV positive individuals born in Australia, the majority were HCV positive (69.8%). HDV positive individuals were less likely to be Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.45-0.93) and recorded lower hepatitis B virus (HBV) viral loads. Positive HDV serology was associated with increased risk of liver cirrhosis (RR, 2.3; 95% CI 1.73-3.07) and liver transplantation (RR, 1.93; CI 1.31-2.85). Only 8% of HDV positive individuals underwent HDV treatment.

Vaccinated individuals infected with measles can develop nodular pneumonia. These cases can be misdiagnosed due to the absence of specific IgM and typical symptoms. An effective diagnostic tool is needed.
Methods
During March 2016, adult inpatients in Yucheng People’s Hospital were enrolled prospectively and included in the study. Patients were included if samples were obtained ≤14 days from the onset of fever. Measles virus was detected by RT-PCR of the oropharyngeal swab sample. Chest computed tomography scans and medical records were obtained. Oropharyngeal swabs and blood samples were collected for IgM and IgG testing, RT-PCR, and gene sequencing.
Results
Sixteen patients were enrolled. Ten were found to have nodular pneumonia and were defined as the nodular group. The remaining six patients were defined as the control group. Measles-specific IgG titers in the nodular group were high (3618.3–5000mIU/ml), while IgM titers were low (<25mIU/ml); IgG titers in the control group were low (241.4–2560.3mIU/ml), while IgM titers were high (137–5000mIU/ml). No obvious viral mutation was detected in the nodular group.
Conclusions
Measles-associated nodular pneumonia was only evident in those patients with an IgG/IgM ratio >20. In measles outbreaks, the IgG/IgM ratio may be useful to identify nodular pneumonia."

To investigate the diagnosis of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and the presence of cytological changes in the cervix in a cohort of sexually active women in Greece.
Methods
Cervical cytology testing and the molecular typing of HPV and other STIs were performed for 345 sexually active women aged between 18 and 45 years (mean 33.2±7.2years) visiting a gynaecology clinic for routine cervical screening. The association of HPV and STI detection with cytological findings was investigated.
Results
HPV was detected in 61 women (17.7%) and STIs in 82 (23.8%). Ureaplasma spp was the most frequently detected pathogen, which was found in 63 (18.2%) women, followed by Mycoplasma spp (21 women, 25.6%) and Chlamydia trachomatis (five women, 6.1%). HPV positivity only (with no co-presence of STI) was associated with an abnormal cytology (odds ratio 6.9, p<0.001), while women who were negative for both HPV and STIs had a higher probability of a normal cytology (odds ratio 0.36, p<0.01). Sixteen out of the 63 (25.4%) women who tested positive for Ureaplasma spp, harboured a high-risk HPV type (odds ratio 2.3, p=0.02).

Vascular pythiosis is a life-threatening infection caused by the oomycete Pythium insidiosum. This article reports the clinical presentation, serodiagnosis, pathology, and outcomes seen at the authors’ institution.
Methods
The cases of patients with proven vascular pythiosis at Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand from January 2006 to December 2016 were analyzed retrospectively.
Results
Thirteen patients were analyzed, eight of whom had underlying thalassemias. Of the remaining five patients, one had aplastic anemia, one had myelodysplasia, one had acute leukemia, one had cirrhosis, and one had alcoholism. Neutropenic patients showed a rapid clinical deterioration. Atypical presentations including carotid arteritis, aneurysm, brain abscess, and stroke occurred in the non-thalassemic patients. Serology yielded positive results in all cases, with a rapid turnaround time. Serology has the advantage of providing a presurgical diagnosis, which allows prompt surgery and clinical cure to be achieved. Pathology revealed a neutrophilic response in the acute phase and a later shift to granuloma. Immunotherapy in combination with itraconazole and terbinafine was given. The amputation rate was 77%, and disease-free surgical margins were achieved in five cases (38%). The mortality rate was 31%.
Conclusions
This study highlights new aspects of pythiosis, such as the unusual host, clinical presentation, serology as a marker for rapid diagnosis, histopathology, and outcomes. Early recognition of the disease with prompt multimodality treatment may improve survival."

Diarrhea is an important health problem among HIV-infected patients. This study evaluated the role of HIV in the epidemiology, etiology, and severity of diarrheal disease among children.
Methods
The Global Enteric Multicenter Study enrolled children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) and less-severe diarrhea (LSD) between December 2007 and November 2012. One to three controls for MSD cases and one per LSD case were enrolled and matched by age, sex, and neighborhood. All children were tested for HIV. Clinical data, anthropometric data, and stool samples were collected. Follow-up was performed at 60 days.
Results
Two hundred and fourteen MSD cases and 418 controls, together with 349 LSD cases and 214 controls were tested. HIV prevalence was 25% among MSD cases (4% for matched controls) and 6% among LSD cases (6% among matched controls). HIV-infected children were more likely to have MSD (odds ratio 5.6, p<0.0001). Mortality rates were higher among HIV-infected children than among the uninfected (34 vs. 5 per 1000 child-weeks at risk; p=0.0039). Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (aatA only) were more prevalent among HIV-infected MSD cases than among uninfected ones.
Conclusion
HIV is an important risk factor for MSD. The high mortality rate implies that children with MSD should be screened for HIV and managed accordingly."

To determine the molecular characteristics and antimicrobial susceptibility of healthcare-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (HA-MRSA) in Zhejiang Province.
Methods
A total of 391 HA-MRSA isolates were collected from 12 hospitals in five cities of Zhejiang Province, between January 2012 and May 2013. Susceptibility to vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, tigecycline, and daptomycin was determined. Resistant isolates were screened for resistance mutations. Ten isolates from each hospital were then chosen at random for molecular typing.
Results
The isolates showed good susceptibility to all five anti-MRSA agents; only five sporadic non-susceptible isolates were detected. CC5/ST5-MRSA-II-t311 (39/120, 32.5%) was found to be the predominant HA-MRSA clone and was spread between the different hospitals in Hangzhou. CC5/ST5-MRSA-II-t002 was the most prevalent clone in Ningbo, while CC239/ST239-MRSA was epidemic only in certain hospitals in Wenzhou and Shaoxing. Fifteen ST59 isolates (15/120, 12.5%) were identified among the HA-MRSA isolates.
Conclusions
CC5/ST5-MRSA-II-t311 has become the predominant HA-MRSA clone in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province. ST59 MRSA has spread into hospitals. The isolates showed good susceptibility to all five anti-MRSA agents."

This study investigated the safety and efficacy of famciclovir compared to acyclovir in patients with herpes zoster, to determine whether the two regimens are equally effective for the treatment of patients with uncomplicated herpes zoster over a period of 7days.
Methods
Patients were randomly assigned to receive either famciclovir 500mg (one tablet) three times daily or acyclovir 800mg (two capsules) five times daily for 7 days. The primary endpoint was defined as the time to full crusting of herpes zoster lesions. Secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved complete cure and the change in score of signs/symptoms (pain, vesicular lesions, loss of sensitivity, burning pain, and pruritus) according to the patient diary. This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01327144).
Results
One hundred and seventy-four patients were enrolled and randomized; 151 of these patients completed treatment (n=75 famciclovir, n=76 acyclovir). A similar proportion of patients who received acyclovir (94.74%) and famciclovir (94.67%) achieved complete cure. The mean time to full crusting of herpes zoster lesions was 15.033days in the acyclovir group and 14.840days in the famciclovir group (log-rank p-value=0.820). The most common adverse events in the pooled groups were headache, diarrhea, nausea, back pain, cold, and drowsiness, but none of these was deemed to be clinically important.
Conclusions
Both interventions obtained high rates of cure and had a similar time to full crusting of lesions. Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint proved that famciclovir is non-inferior to acyclovir, as the confidence interval for the difference in efficacy did not violate the non-inferior margin. Therefore, the results are not different enough to be clinically relevant."

To assess the impact of capacity-building interventions introduced by the Oman National AIDS Programme on the quality of HIV care in the country.
Methods
HIV viral load (VL) suppression and loss to follow-up (LTFU) rates were calculated for the period before (in December 2015; n=1098) and after (in June 2017; n=1185) the introduction of the interventions: training, support, and care pathway development. Three HIV VL cuts-offs at last measurement in the year of interest were used to define VL suppression.
Results
In the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, rates of VL <200 copies/ml and <1000 copies/ml increased from 51.9% in 2015 to 65.5% in 2017 (relative risk (RR) 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17–1.36) and from 58.1% in 2015 to 70.9% in 2017 (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.14–1.30), respectively; p<0.0001 for both. Similarly, in the on-treatment analysis, rates of VL <200 copies/ml and <1000copies/ml increased from 64.2% in 2015 to 76.9% in 2017 (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.12–1.28) and from 71.9% in 2015 to 83.2% in 2017 (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.10–1.22), respectively.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) isolates obtained from prospectively sampled pulmonary TB patients between July 2012 and December 2015 were characterized using spoligotyping and standard 15-locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing for transmission studies.
Results
Out of 2309 MTBC isolates, 1082 (46.9%) unique cases were identified, with 1227 (53.1%) isolates belonging to one of 276 clusters. The recent TB transmission rate was estimated to be 41.2%. Whereas TB strains of lineage 4 belonging to M. tuberculosis showed a high recent transmission rate (44.9%), reduced recent transmission rates were found for lineages of Mycobacterium africanum (lineage 5, 31.8%; lineage 6, 24.7%).
Conclusions
The study findings indicate high recent TB transmission, suggesting the occurrence of unsuspected outbreaks in Ghana. The observed reduced transmission rate of M. africanum suggests other factor(s) (host/environmental) may be responsible for its continuous presence in West Africa."

keywords = "Contact investigation, Tuberculosis, Active tuberculosis, Tuberculosis epidemiology, Relapse, Risk factors, Screening",
abstract = "Background
Patients completing treatment for tuberculosis (TB) in high-prevalence settings face a risk of developing recurrent disease. This has important consequences for public health, given its association with drug resistance and a poor prognosis. Previous research has implicated individual factors such as smoking, alcohol use, HIV, poor treatment adherence, and drug resistant disease as risk factors for recurrence. However, little is known about how these factors co-act to produce recurrent disease. Furthermore, perhaps factors related to the index disease means higher burden/low resource settings may be more prone to recurrent disease that could be preventable.
Methods
We conducted a case-control study nested within a cohort of consecutively enrolled adults who were being treated for smear positive pulmonary TB in 70 randomly selected district clinics in Vietnam. Cases were patients with recurrent TB, identified by follow-up from the parent cohort study. Controls were selected from the cohort by random sampling. Information on demographic, clinical and disease-related characteristics was obtained by interview. Treatment information was extracted from clinic registries. Logistic regression, with stepwise selection, was used to develop a fully adjusted model for the odds of recurrence of TB.
Results
We recruited 10,964 patients between October 2010 and July 2013. Median follow-up was 988 days. At the end of follow-up, 505 patients (4.7%) with recurrence were identified as cases and 630 other patients were randomly selected as controls. Predictors of recurrence included multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB (adjusted odds ratio 79.6; 95% CI: 25.1-252.0), self-reported prior TB therapy (aOR=2.5; 95% CI: 1.7-3.5), and incomplete adherence (aOR=1.9; 95% CI 1.1-3.1).
Conclusions
Index disease treatment history is a leading determinant of relapse among patients with TB in Vietnam. Further research is required to identify interventions that will reduce the risk of recurrent disease and enhance its early detection within high-risk populations."

abstract = "Background
Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are the most common causes of death in children under 5 years of age. While the etiology of most pneumonia and ARI episodes is undiagnosed, a broad range of ARI-causing viruses circulate widely in South East Asia. However, the patterns and drivers of the seasonal transmission dynamics are largely unknown. Here we identify the seasonal patterns of multiple circulating viruses associated with hospitalizations for ARIs in Nha Trang, Vietnam.
Methods
Hospital based enhanced surveillance of childhood ARI is ongoing at Khanh Hoa General Hospital in Nha Trang. RT-PCR was performed to detect 13 respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal samples from enrolled patients. Seasonal patterns of childhood ARI hospital admissions of various viruses were assessed, as well as their association with rainfall, temperature, and dew point.
Results
Respiratory syncytial virus peaks in the late summer months, and influenza A in April to June. We find significant associations between detection of human parainfluenza 3 and human rhinovirus with the month's mean dew point. Using a cross-wavelet transform we find a significant out-of-phase relationship between human parainfluenza 3 and temperature and dew point.
Conclusions
Our results are important for understanding the temporal risk associated with circulating pathogens in Southern Central Vietnam. Specifically, our results can inform timing of routing seasonal influenza vaccination and for when observed respiratory illness is likely viral, leading to judicious use of antibiotics in the region."

Epidemiological data from Latin America on acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in the post rotavirus vaccine era obtained using highly sensitive molecular techniques are scarce.
Methods
This prospective surveillance study was performed between March 15, 2015 and March 19, 2016 in two municipal health networks (MHNs) in Cali, Colombia to detect AGE in children <5 years of age. Consecutive sampling was performed simultaneously in all health facilities belonging to both MHNs until completion of the required sample size. Stool samples from AGE patients were tested with a nucleic acid assay for 16 pathogens. Detection frequency and incidence rates were obtained for specific pathogens according to age-group in children with AGE leading to hospitalization or outpatient care.
Results
Overall incidence rates of AGE-related hospitalization and outpatient care were 20 and 237 per 1000 children <5 years of age, respectively. Despite almost complete rotavirus vaccine uptake, rotavirus was the most common etiology overall, including hospitalization and outpatient treatment of 0–23-month-olds, with incidence rates of 12 and 108 per 1000 children, respectively. Norovirus incidence rates were similar to rotavirus rates in this age group and associated with high Vesikari scores. Shigella predominated in 24–59-month-olds.
Conclusions
AGE remains an important cause of morbidity in children under 5 years of age, especially in those under 2 years. Rotavirus remains the leading AGE-associated pathogen, followed closely by norovirus in younger children. Preventive measures, including novel vaccination strategies, are necessary in this population to further reduce AGE-related morbidity."

This first cross-sectional survey on latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in Singapore was performed by utilizing the QuantiFERON Gold In-tube (QFT-GIT) assay to collect data on the prevalence of LTBI and to identify potential risk factors associated with LTBI.
Methods
Nationwide household addresses were selected randomly for enumeration, and Singaporeans or Permanent Residents aged 18–79 years were identified. One eligible member per household was selected using the Kish grid. Each participant answered a questionnaire assessing their medical history (including tuberculosis (TB)), socio-economic factors, and lifestyle factors. They also provided a blood specimen for the QFT-GIT assay. Participants with a positive QFT-GIT result were defined as having LTBI if they were asymptomatic. To identify independent risk factors, adjusted hazard ratios were obtained using the multivariable modified Breslow–Cox proportional hazards model.
Results
An overall QFT-GIT positivity rate of 12.7% was detected amongst 1682 Singapore residents. There was a wide variation in the positivity rate according to the participants’ country of birth. Higher LTBI prevalence was also significantly associated with increasing age, lower educational and socio-economic status, and alcohol use.
Conclusions
Given the high prevalence of LTBI amongst foreign-born residents from regional countries, similar studies should be conducted amongst migrants in Singapore to improve national guidelines on screening and preventive treatment against LTBI."

Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), mainly lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), induce colorectal symptoms that may be misdiagnosed as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study describes patients who presented with STDs masquerading as IBD in order to improve understanding of missed diagnosis of colorectal STDs and their association with LGV in Israel.
Methods
This retrospective, descriptive study characterized the clinical, endoscopic, and pathological findings of 16 patients who were diagnosed with a colorectal STD after erroneously being diagnosed with IBD. Molecular genotyping was used to characterize some of the Chlamydia trachomatis isolates.
Results
All patients were men who have sex with men (MSM), mostly HIV-1-positive, and had clinical and endoscopic findings compatible with IBD. The STD was diagnosed 1–36 months after the initial diagnosis: 14 were positive for Chlamydia trachomatis, of which three were of the LGV2b (ST58) serotype and one was ST 108 serotype. Five were positive for gonorrhea and four were positive for syphilis. Several pathogens were diagnosed in six episodes.
Conclusions
Colorectal STDs may resemble IBD and therefore their diagnosis may be delayed. IBD symptoms in MSM who engage in non-protected anal sex should prompt at least syphilis and anal PCR for STD testing. If C. trachomatis is diagnosed but LGV subtyping cannot be done, doxycycline 100mg twice daily for 21days should be recommended."

We evaluated the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence during pregnancy in sub-Saharan Africa.
Methods
For this meta-analysis, the following databases were searched: MEDLINE Complete, Embase, Global Health, CINAHL Complete, and Google Scholar. Randomized and nonrandomized studies were considered for inclusion if they involved an intervention with the intent of improving medication adherence among pregnant women taking ART in sub-Saharan Africa. Databases were searched from inception to the end of August 2017. The primary outcome assessed was adherence to ART, defined as the proportion of women adherent to treatment in the control and intervention groups. Risk ratios and random effect meta-analysis were undertaken, and heterogeneity was examined with the I2 statistic.
Results
The systematic search of databases yielded a total of 402 articles, of which 19 studies were selected for meta-analysis with a total of 27,974 participants. Nine types of interventions were identified in the 19 studies to improve ART adherence. The test for the subgroup differences showed that there was a statistically significant difference among the 9 subgroups of interventions, χ2 (8)=102.38; p=0.00001. Collectively, in the meta-analysis, the various intervention types made a significant impact on improving medication adherence. The overall effect estimate with 95% CI was as follows: 1.25 (95% CI=1.03, 1.52, p=0.03). The following risk ratio results for meta-analysis were obtained for the three interventions that showed significant impact on adherence; namely social support and structural support, 1.58 (95% CI=1.36, 1.84, p<0.00001); education, social support and structural support=2.60 (95% CI=1.95, 3.45, p<0.00001); and device reminder=1.13 (95% CI=1.05, 1.20, p=0.0004). The proportion of women who were adherent to ART as a result of the interventions was 59.3% compared with 22.5% in the control groups.
Conclusion
The use of device reminder, a combination of social support and structural support, and education, social support and structural support has the potential to improve ART adherence during pregnancy. Good quality prospective observational studies and randomized control trials are needed in sub-Saharan Africa to determine the most effective interventions."

abstract = "Objective
Pythiosis is a life-threatening infectious disease caused by the oomycete Pythium insidiosum. The disease has been increasingly reported worldwide. Most patients with pythiosis undergo surgical removal of an infected organ. Early diagnosis contributes to better prognosis of pythiosis patients. Here, we assessed the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for identification and biotyping of P. insidiosum.
Methods
A comprehensive set of mass spectra of P. insidiosum was generated to evaluate MALDI-TOF MS for identification and biotyping of P. insidiosum.
Results
MALDI-TOF MS accurately identified all 13 P. insidiosum strains tested, at the species level. Mass spectra of P. insidiosum did not match any other microorganisms, including fungi (i.e., Aspergillus species, Fusarium species, and fungal species of the class Zygomycetes), which have similar microscopic morphologies with this oomycete. MALDI-TOF MS- and rDNA sequence-based biotyping methods consistently classified P. insidiosum into three groups: Clade-I (American strains), II (Asian and Australian strains), and III (mostly Thai strains).
Conclusions
MALDI-TOF MS has been successfully used for identification and biotyping of P. insidiosum. The obtained mass spectral database allows clinical microbiology laboratories, well-equipped with a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer, to conveniently identify P. insidiosum, without requiring any pathogen-specific reagents (i.e., antigen, antibody or primers)."

Different polio vaccination schemes have been used in Russia: oral polio vaccine (OPV) was used in 1998–2007 and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) followed by OPV in 2008–2014. This article presents the characteristics of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) cases in Russia during this period.
Methods
VAPP cases were identified through the acute flaccid paralysis surveillance system, classified by the National Expert Classification Committee. Criteria for a ‘recipient VAPP’ (rVAPP) case were poliomyelitis symptoms 6–30days after OPV administration, isolation of the vaccine virus, and residual paralysis 60days after disease onset. Unvaccinated cases with a similar picture 6–60days after contact with an OPV recipient were classified as ‘contact VAPP’ (cVAPP) cases.
Results
During 1998–2014, 127 VAPP cases were registered: 82 rVAPP and 45 cVAPP. During the period in which only OPV was used, rVAPP cases prevailed (73.8%); cases of rVAPP were reduced during the sequential scheme period (15%). Poliovirus type 3 (39.5%) and type 2 (23.7%) were isolated more often. Vaccine-derived poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 were isolated from three cases of cVAPP. The incidence of VAPP cases was higher during the period of OPV use (1 case/1.59 million OPV doses) than during the sequential scheme period (1 case/4.18 million doses).
Conclusion
The risk of VAPP exists if OPV remains in the vaccination schedule."

Proctitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) are known as sexually transmitted infections (STI). This study describes their clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects.
Methods
Between 01/2013-03/2015, all MSM consulting for proctitis at proctology Institute-Saint-Joseph’s Hospital, Paris, were included. Demographic, past-medical history, STI status and medical treatment were collected. Detection of CT/NG was performed by Transcription-Mediated Amplification (TMA) and antimicrobial susceptibilities for Ng by agar diffusion method.
Results
On 441 rectal samples collected, 221 (50.1%) were positive: 109 Ct (49.3%), 70 Ng (31.7%), 42 positive for both etiologies (19%). Among Ng infections, no resistance was detected to azithromycin and ceftriaxone. However, 84 strains (43.2%) were resistant to fluoroquinolones. More than one episode was diagnosed for 10 (5.1%) and 12 (6.2%) patients with CT and NG infections respectively. Anal abscesses were found for 27 (13.9%) patients, and 14 (7.2%) of them underwent surgery for anal fistula.
Conclusions
The prevalence of CT/NG anorectal infections described is high on symptomatic patients, and a significant level of abscess was reported. These results confirm the interest of the association of recommended antibiotics excluding quinolones. Prospective studies would be relevant on complicated forms of anorectal infections."

The positive PCR products were sequenced and the sequences were aligned using the NCBI BLAST program. The homologous and phylogenetic analysis was conducted using MEGA 6 program. On microscopy of direct smears, motile cells with pseudopodia were observed, and the motion characteristics of the pseudopodia as well as the cell morphology suggested that the pathogens were amoeba trophozoites. Wright–Giemsa-stained smears showed amoeba trophozoites of various shapes, which measured 10–25μm in size; these were characterized by a prominent, centrally placed nucleolus and a vacuolated cytoplasm. PCR was negative for Entamoeba histolytica and Entamoeba dispar, but positive for Naegleria spp. and N. fowleri. The nucleotide sequences acquired in this study have been submitted to GenBank with accession numbers KX909928 and KX909927, respectively. The BLAST analysis revealed that the sequences of KX909928 and KX909927 had 100% similarity with the sequence of the N. fowleri gene (KT375442.1). Sequence alignment and the phylogenetic tree revealed that the N. fowleri collected in this study was classified as genotype 2 and was most closely related to Naegleria lovaniensis. This study confirmed N. fowleri as the agent responsible for the infection in this patient. PAM normally progresses rapidly and is generally universally fatal within a week.

abstract = "Background
Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea worldwide. As a result, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have designated C. difficile as an urgent threat. Despite the global public health risk posed by CDI, little is known about its epidemiology on the African continent. This article describes the common occurrence of CDI from a cross-section of consecutively seen, randomly enrolled patients presenting with diarrhea at two major hospitals in Kenya.
Methods
Patients presenting with diarrhea at two major hospitals in Kenya from May to July 2017 were enrolled. After signing the informed consent, stool samples, demographic data, medical history, prior antibiotic use, and HIV status were obtained from the patients. C. difficile was detected and validated by toxigenic culture and PCR.
Results
The average age of the patients was 35.5 years (range 3–86 years); 59% were male and 41% were female. Out of 105 patient stools tested, 98 (93.3%) were positive for C. difficile by culture. PCR analysis confirmed C. difficile-specific genes, tcdA, tcdB, and tcdC, in the strains isolated from the stools. Further, 82.5% of the stools had C. difficile isolates bearing the frame-shift deletion associated with hypervirulent strains. Remarkably, 91.9% of the stools that tested positive for C. difficile came from patients under 60 years old, with 64.3% being less than 40 years of age. The majority of the patients (85%) reported over-the-counter antibiotic use in the last 30days before the hospital visit.
Conclusions
Together, the results revealed an unusually high incidence of C. difficile in the stools analyzed, especially among young adults who are thought to be less vulnerable. Comprehensive research is urgently needed to examine the epidemiology, risk factors, pathogenesis, comorbidities, clinical outcomes, antibiotic susceptibility, and genetic makeup of C. difficile strains circulating on the African continent."

Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are the main cause of infectious complications in patients with indwelling urinary catheters (IDCs). However, the best cleaning methods for the prevention of CAUTIs have not been evaluated clearly in previous studies.
Methods
An electronic database search was performed, from inception to December 2017. Randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental trials using different methods of urethral cleaning versus disinfection to prevent CAUTIs were considered. The study selection and data collection were performed independently by two reviewers. The risk of bias assessment was performed using the Cochrane risk of bias scale. The primary outcome was the incidence rates of CAUTIs. A network meta-analysis was conducted to compare the effect among the different methods of urethral cleaning versus disinfection to prevent CAUTIs.
Results
Thirty-three studies (6490 patients) with seven different methods of urethral cleaning versus disinfection were eligible for inclusion, and the data were summarized in the network meta-analysis. No evidence of heterogeneity (P>0.05) was observed among the studies. The network meta-analysis showed that there was no difference in the incidence of CAUTIs when comparing the different urethral cleaning methods versus disinfection (P>0.05 for all). However, chlorhexidine ranked first in the results of the Bayesian analysis and is recommended for preventing CAUTIs.
Conclusions
Current evidence suggests that there are no significant differences among different urethral cleaning versus disinfection methods with regard to CAUTI incidence rates."

Tuberculosis is a major cause of mortality among HIV-infected inpatients, and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends an algorithm to improve diagnosis. The urine lateral flow lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and sputum Xpert MTB/RIF tests are promising tools, but the optimal diagnostic algorithm is unclear.
Methods
This prospective cohort study enrolled HIV-positive inpatients with cough and WHO danger signs. The Xpert MTB/RIF test and mycobacterial culture were performed on sputum using sputum induction when necessary, and the LAM test was performed on stored urine. Tuberculosis was diagnosed by culture from any site. The diagnostic accuracy and costs of testing were determined for single and combined tests.
Results
Tuberculosis was confirmed in 169 of 332 patients (50.9%). The yield of LAM, Xpert MTB/RIF on spontaneous sputum (Xpert Spot), and Xpert MTB/RIF on spontaneous or induced sputum (Xpert SI) was 35.5%, 23.1%, and 90.5%, respectively. When LAM was placed before Xpert Spot and Xpert SI in an algorithm, the yield was 50.9% and 92.3%, respectively. Adding culture to Xpert MTB/RIF only increased the yield by 1.2% and 2.7%, respectively. Use of the LAM test reduced costs.
Conclusions
Sputum induction is important to increase the yield of Xpert MTB/RIF for seriously ill patients with HIV and cough. LAM testing has little effect on yield when sputum induction is available, but reduces costs and may have other benefits."

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a single-stranded RNA virus infecting a variety of animals and humans. Little is known of HEV infection among cancer patients in China. This study provides new epidemiological data for the prevalence of HEV co-infection in cancer patients, indicating that HEV infection is common in this group.
Methods
A total of 950 cancer patients and 950 control volunteers from Shandong Province, eastern China, were recruited to participate in this investigation. Blood samples from patients and controls were examined for anti-HEV IgG and IgM antibodies using ELISAs.
Results
The overall seroprevalence of IgG and IgM antibodies to HEV was significantly higher in cancer patients (247/950, 26.0%) than in controls (123/950, 13.0%) (p<0.001). In cancer patients, 22.7% of serum samples were anti-HEV IgG-positive, and in control subjects, 11.0% were anti-HEV IgG-positive (p<0.001). For IgM antibodies, seroprevalence was 4.2% in cancer patients (n=40) and 2.1% in controls (n=20) (p=0.009). The seroprevalence of HEV was higher in cancer patients who had dogs in their home (31.7%) when compared to other cancer patients. The highest seroprevalence of HEV infection was found in leukemia patients (32.3%), followed by liver cancer patients (31.1%); the lowest HEV seroprevalence was detected in patients with gastric cancer (18.9%).
Conclusions
This investigation revealed that the seroprevalence of HEV was significantly higher in cancer patients than in controls in eastern China. Therefore, cancer patients are a high-risk population and should be kept away from sources of HEV infection."

Whole genome shotgun sequencing and comparative microbial genomic analyses were used to characterize the isolate from a patient diagnosed with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) after relapse.
Results
The genome sequence of the first case of M. yongonense (M. yongonense RT 955-2015) in Tanzania is presented. Sequence analysis revealed that the RT 955-2015 strain had a high similarity to M. yongonense 05-1390(T) (98.74%) and Mycobacterium chimaera DSM 44623(T) (98%). Its 16S rRNA showed similarity to Mycobacterium paraintracellulare KCTC 290849(T) (100%), Mycobacterium intracellulare ATCC 13950(T) (100%), M. chimaera DSM 44623(T) (99.9%), and M. yongonense 05-1390(T) (98%).

Conclusions
In light of the OrthoANI algorithm and phylogenetic analysis, it was concluded that the isolate was M. yongonense Type II genotype, which is an indication that the patient was misdiagnosed with TB/MDR-TB and received inappropriate treatment."

Schistosomiasis is an important disease in Madagascar, and several studies on the disease have focused on the occurrence of the parasite in humans. However, the range of the pathogen in the environment and its impact on human infection is difficult to predict. An environmental DNA (eDNA) detection system for Schistosoma mansoni was developed to improve schistosomiasis eco-epidemiology studies.
Methods
Primers and probes were designed and tested in experimental biotopes. The field study was conducted in Maevatanana District of Madagascar. Seven water sources with human use were sampled, with a total of 21 water samples collected. Snails were collected, and patients were examined by ultrasound to determine the occurrence of schistosomiasis in the study area.
Results
One water source with active transmission was identified through the detection of S. mansoni eDNA in the water and the intermediate host Biomphalaria pfeifferi collected from the same water source. People with clinical schistosomiasis were found in the area, reinforcing the findings.
Conclusions
The application of eDNA in eco-epidemiology enables the determination of hot spots and safe spots in endemic areas, constituting an alternative ecological tool for follow-up and monitoring of control programs for schistosomiasis, and contributing information on water safety for improving the standard of living of the people in endemic areas."

Results
One hundred SAB infection episodes occurring in 98 patients were included. SAB was healthcare-associated in 68.4%; 24.0% of all cases were caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Ninety-day mortality was 47.0%, with 83.3% of deaths attributable to SAB. There was a trend towards increased 90-day mortality with MRSA infection (odds ratio (OR) 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0–15.1) and the presence of comorbidities (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.0–21.6).

Using a standardized web-based electronic data entry form, detailed data were collected for babies on antimicrobials.
Results
A total of 403 babies were admitted to NICUs across all survey days, and 208 (51.6%) were prescribed one or more antimicrobials. Among 208 babies, 155 (74.5%) were prescribed antimicrobials for treatment of an active infection. Among 155 babies with an active infection, treatment was empiric in 109 (70.3%). Sepsis (108, 49.1%) was the most common reason for prescribing antimicrobials. Amikacin (17%) followed by meropenem (12%) were the two most commonly prescribed antimicrobials. For community-acquired sepsis, piperacillin-tazobactam (17.5%) was the most commonly prescribed drug. A combination of ampicillin and gentamicin was prescribed in only two babies (5%).
Conclusions
The recommended first-line antimicrobial agents, ampicillin and gentamicin, were rarely prescribed in Indian NICUs for community acquired neonatal sepsis."

The objective was to determine the effectiveness of two piperacillin–tazobactam molecules in terms of all-cause mortality, mortality by infection, and hospital stay.
Methods
A cohort study was performed involving patients treated with piperacillin–tazobactam at a clinic in Colombia. The patients were divided into those who received the innovator piperacillin–tazobactam (from July to December 2014) and those who received the generic piperacillin–tazobactam (from January to June 2015). Socio-demographic, clinical (all-cause mortality, death by infection, days of hospitalization), microbiological, pharmacological, and comorbidity variables were evaluated. Multivariate analyses were performed.
Results
A total of 279 patients were included: 140 treated with the innovator piperacillin–tazobactam and 139 with the generic piperacillin–tazobactam. The median age was 63 years, and 56% of the patients were male. There was no statistically significant difference in death from all causes (22.9% vs. 14.4%, p=0.069), death by infection (7.9 vs. 10.8%, p=0.399), or hospital stay (18.1±16.2 vs. 15.7±11.6 days, p=0.178) between the innovator and generic piperacillin–tazobactam, respectively.
Conclusions
The generic piperacillin–tazobactam was equivalent to the innovator piperacillin–tazobactam with regards to all-cause mortality, mortality by infection, hospital stay, and safety, and at a lower cost, which may be useful for decision-makers in hospitals."

The rapid emergence of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii is a global health concern. A comparative genomic analysis was performed on two ST85 A. baumannii strains harboring blaNDM-1 and blaOXA-94 collected in Lebanon from Syrian Civil War victims.
Methods
Genome sequencing data of ACMH-6200 and ACMH-6201 were used for in silico extraction of multilocus sequence types (MLST), resistance genes, and virulence factors. Plasmids were genetically mapped in silico and using PCR-based replicon typing (PBRT). The genetic environment of blaNDM-1 and blaOXA-94 was determined, and whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism (wgSNP) analysis in comparison with 41 publicly available A. baumannii genomes was performed.
Results
Tn125 carrying blaNDM-1 was truncated by the insertion of ISAba14 downstream of dct, generating ΔTn125. blaOXA-94 was upstream of ISAba13 and ISAba17. Resistance to ceftazidime could be attributed to AmpC cephalosporinase encoded by blaADC-25, and to blaNDM-1 on plasmids. GyrA (S83L) and ParC (S80L) substitutions conferred resistance to fluoroquinolones. wgSNP analysis separated the isolates based on their sequence types.
Conclusions
The role of refugees in the transmission of antimicrobial resistance in developing countries is understudied. As such, this study sheds light on the correlation between population mobility and the importation of drug-resistant pathogens. It also highlights the manifold mechanisms underlying antibiotic resistance in A. baumannii."

abstract = "Background
Central nervous system (CNS) viral infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality. No data are available regarding their epidemiology in Qatar.
Design
We retrospectively evaluated all cerebrospinal fluid findings from January 2011–March 2015 at Hamad Medical Corporation. Those with abnormal CSF finding were included in our study. We excluded those with missing medical records, no clinical evidence of viral CNS infection, or proven bacterial, fungal or tuberculosis CNS infection. CNS clinical findings were classified as meningitis, encephalitis or myelitis.
Results
Among 7690 patients with available CSF results, 550 cases met the inclusion criteria (meningitis 74.7%; encephalitis 25%; myelitis 0.4%). Two-thirds (65%) were male and 50% were between 16–60 years old. Viral etiology was confirmed in 38% (enterovirus, 44.3%; Epstein-Barr virus, 31%; varicella zoster virus, 12.4%). The estimated incidence was 6.4 per 100,000 population. Two persons died and the rest were discharged to home. Among those with confirmed viral etiology, 83.8% received ceftriaxone (mean duration 7.3±5.2 days), 38% received vancomycin (mean duration 2.7±5.4 days) and 38% received at least one other antibiotic. Intravenous acyclovir was continued for more than 48h in patients with confirmed negative viral etiology (mean duration 5±5.6 days).
Conclusion
Viral etiology is not uncommon among those evaluated for CNS infection in Qatar. Clinical outcomes are excellent in this group of patients. Antibiotics and acyclovir are overly used even when a viral etiology is confirmed. There is a need for clinician education regarding etiology and treatment of viral CNS infections."

This study sought to determine the endemic Leishmania species, the clinical features of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in the Central Rift Valley in Kenya and to give an account on unresponsiveness to treatment in the region.
Methods
Participants were clinically identified and grouped into untreated, classical and recidivate based on clinical manifestation and clinical data. Leishmaniasis recidivans lesions were scaly hyperemic papules that appeared before the classic lesion had healed or after healing. The demographics and socio-economic data were recorded and lesion scraping samples screened through microscopy and Internal Transcribed Spacer 1-PCR. Leishmania species were identified using Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism.
Results
A total of 52 participants were sampled, of which, 44.2% of the cases were recidivate and L. tropica the only species identified. All patients had been treated using sodium stibogluconate (SSG) which is the recommended first-line drug in Kenya. 60% of the patients experienced prolonged exposure to the drug (>30 days).
Conclusion
L. tropica is the endemic Leishmania species for CL leading to classical and leishmaniasis recidivans. Treatment of CL in the area is not effective hence, alternative measures/therapy should be considered to cope with the unresponsiveness."

A prospective observational study was undertaken from January 2013 to March 2015 at a referral center in Okinawa, Japan. All enrolled patients were adults with an episode of shaking chills who were newly admitted to the division of infectious diseases. The study exposure was the time lag between blood culture draw and the most recent episode of shaking chills.
Results
Among patients whose blood cultures were obtained within 2h after shaking chills started, the blood culture positivity was 53.6% (52/97), whereas among patients whose blood cultures were obtained after more than 2h, the positivity was 37.6% (44/117) (p=0.019). The adjusted odds ratio of blood culture positivity for samples drawn within 2h after shaking chills was 1.88 (95% confidence interval 1.01–3.51, p=0.046).

abstract = "Background
Strategic Index Case Testing (STRICT), a form of partner notification service, was initiated to track, identify and notify sexual partners of people living with HIV (Index clients) with the sole aim of testing them to determine their HIV status and linking clients who are positive to Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART). This research analyzed the HIV sero-prevalence among sexual partners of HIV positive clients using STRICT and determines the role of STRICT in HIV epidemic control.
Methods
This is a non-control Interventional study that determined the impact of Strategic Index Case Testing (STRICT) on detecting previously undiagnosed HIV infections among sexual partners of positive index clients. This study was conducted in seven Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Karu, Nasarawa, Lafia, Doma, AMAC, Bwari, and Ushongo. These LGAs were selected for HIV epidemic control due to projected high prevalence of HIV from previous program level data. HTS was offered to sexual partners of index PLHIV from facility and community within the LGAs. Index clients were PLHIV diagnosed from outreaches, hot spots set up in strategic places and Provider Initiated Testing and Counseling (PITC) in comprehensive and primary health care facilities. Newly diagnosed PLHIV and those already enrolled and commenced on ART from October 2015 to July 2016 were identified from source registers. These index clients were counseled on how to notify their sexual partners about their HIV status and on bringing them for HIV Testing and Counseling (HTS). Those unable to do so after a given period of time were assisted by health workers in informing their various sexual partners based on the confidential agreement and informed consent signed by the Index clients.
Findings
A total of 1277 index cases were counseled and interviewed with 879 index clients agreeing to disclosure, giving a disclosure rate of 68.3%. We identified 888 sexual partners from the interviews and traced 870 (97.9%) sexual contacts. A total of 741 (85.2%) of 870 sexual contacts traced were tested for HIV, out of which 378 (51%) tested positive using an HIV rapid test kit, and this was statistically significant at P Value=0.0254. A total of 348 (92.1%) out of 378 HIV positive sexual partners were immediately commenced on ART using the recommended UNAIDS Test and Treat approach to HIV epidemic control.
Interpretation
STRICT identifies the need for reaching out to sexual partners of index clients and providing them with HIV Testing Services (HTS) as they belong to a high risk priority population and also linking them to care and treatment. This group of people must be reached with HTS strategies in order to end the HIV epidemic as evidenced by high sero-prevalence of 51% among them."

To analyse a measles outbreak in a Roma community.
Methods
We describe a community-wide outbreak of genotype D8 measles that took place in southeastern France, between May and July 2017, along with the control measures adopted.
Results
We identified a total of eighteen cases, between six months and 24 years old. All cases were unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated and belonged to a sedentary French Roma community. Most of them (67%) were hospitalised, with three cases (17%) of severe measles including one death of a 16-year-old girl who had previously received oral corticosteroids. The latter was the only lethal case notified in France during the year 2017. Control measures included intensification of surveillance, isolation of cases, and a large vaccination campaign in this Roma community. During the outbreak period, there was no case of healthcare-associated measles transmission. A broad adherence to vaccination through the mediating role of both the chief of the community and the pastor allowed reaching completed vaccination coverage of 90%.
Conclusions
Efforts should be concentrated to enhance access to health services for minorities such as the Roma community characterized by low vaccination coverage. A trustful relationship with leaders of the community is essential to ensure adherence to vaccination. In France, attributable mortality to measles is low and concerns mainly unvaccinated and immunodepressed patients."

Dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) infections are rapidly expanding across countries and are being diagnosed in returned travellers who represent epidemiological sentinels. The French Territories of America (FTA) such as Guadeloupe and Martinique see high levels of tourism and have experienced three consecutive outbreaks by these viruses in the last decade.
Objective
This study was performed to evaluate how ill returned travellers could have represented epidemiological sentinels for these three expanding arboviral diseases over eight consecutive years. The degree of correlation between the cases of ill returned travellers arriving at a French tertiary hospital in Paris and the three outbreaks that occurred in the FTA during the study period was estimated.
Methods
All consecutive ill returned travellers diagnosed at the hospital in Paris with imported DENV, CHIKV, or ZIKV infections from January 2009 to December 2016 were included. Epidemiological and clinical variables were evaluated. Data concerning the incidence of arboviruses in the FTA, as well as the temporal relationship between the occurrence of imported cases and outbreaks in the FTA, were analyzed.
Results
Overall, 320 cases of arboviral infection were reported: 216 DENV, 68 CHIKV, and 36 ZIKV. Most of the patients presented with fever and exanthema. One hundred and fifteen patients were exposed in Guadeloupe or Martinique, which were the at-risk destinations in 25% of patients with DENV, 59% of patients with CHIKV, and 58% of patients with ZIKV. The occurrence of cases diagnosed in returning travellers followed the same time pattern as the outbreaks in these areas.
Conclusions
A temporal correlation was found between newly diagnosed imported cases of arboviruses and the three corresponding outbreaks that occurred in Martinique and Guadeloupe during 8 consecutive years. Thus, ill returned travellers act as epidemiological sentinels from the beginning up to the end of outbreaks occurring in touristic locations."

East African trypanosomiasis is an uncommon, potentially lethal disease if not diagnosed and treated in a timely manner. South Africa, as a centre for emergency medical evacuations from much of sub-Saharan Africa, receives a high proportion of these patients, mostly tourists and expatriate residents.
Methods
The cases of East African trypanosomiasis patients evacuated to South Africa, for whom diagnostic and clinical management advice was provided over the years 2004–2018, were reviewed, using the authors’ own records and those of collaborating clinicians.
Results
Twenty-one cases were identified. These originated in Zambia, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, and Uganda. Nineteen cases (90%) had stage 1 (haemolymphatic) disease; one of these patients had fatal myocarditis. Of the two patients with stage 2 (meningoencephalitic) disease, one died of melarsoprol encephalopathy. Common problems were delayed diagnosis, erroneous assessment of severity, and limited access to treatment.
Conclusions
The key to early diagnosis is recognition of the triad of geographic exposure, tsetse fly bites, and trypanosomal chancre, plus good microscopy. Elements for successful management are rapid access to specific drug treatment, skilled intensive care, and good laboratory facilities. Clinical experience and the local stock of antitrypanosomal drugs from the World Health Organization have improved the chance of a successful outcome in the management of East African trypanosomiasis in South Africa; the survival rate over the period was 90.5%."

To study the epidemiology of dengue with reference to serological, demographic profile, spatio-temporal distribution, vectors, circulating serotypes and coinfections.
Methods
Demographic data and presenting symptoms of fever cases reporting to the clinic were recorded. Suspected patients were tested for dengue, chikungunya and malaria. Dengue specific RT-PCR was performed to detect circulating DENV serotypes. Vector surveys were carried out to detect Aedes breeding.
Results
Of the 5536 fever patients tested during 2012 to 2015, 1536 (27.7%) had confirmed dengue. The peak in dengue positivity was observed during September and October. Of the 60 samples analysed, 10 (16.7%) had concurrent infection with multiple dengue serotypes; one of them had all the four serotypes. Coinfection of dengue with malaria and chikungunya was also observed. The occurrence of dengue and malaria was inversely related. Seven percent of the dengue patients required hospitalization. Vector surveys in the draining area revealed Aedes breeding with a high house index.
Conclusion
Delhi being hyperendemic, the occurrence of concurrent infections with multiple DENV serotypes has become a frequent finding. The study emphasizes the need of epidemiological and entomological surveillance to monitor trends in dengue distribution, seasonal patterns and circulating serotypes to guide dengue control activities."

This study aimed to characterize the risk factors for mortality in adult patients with invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) stratified by age groups, after implementation of the national immunization program of 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) for those aged ≥65 years in the Republic of Korea (ROK).
Methods
Clinical data and pneumococcal isolates from adult patients with IPD (≥18 years of age) were collected prospectively from 20 hospitals through the nationwide surveillance program from March 2013 to October 2015.
Results
A total of 319 patients with IPD were enrolled. Median age was 69 years. Overall in-hospital mortality was 34.2%: 17.1% in those aged 18–49 years, 23.7% in those aged 50–64 years, 33.0% in those aged 65–74 years, and 51.0% in those aged ≥75 years (p<0.001). In particular, early death within 7days of hospitalization accounted for 60.6% (66/109). While old age (≥65 years), higher Pitt bacteremia score (≥4), and bacteremic pneumonia were independently associated with IPD mortality in all age groups, an additional mortality risk factor of immunocompromised status was identified for patients aged 50–64 years. PPSV23 serotypes accounted for 64.4% (122/189) of the pneumococcal isolates serotyped.
Conclusions
This study suggests that vaccine-type IPD continues to place a substantial burden on older adults in the ROK, necessitating an effective vaccination strategy for those at higher risk."

abstract = "Background
Carbapenem-resistant (CR), extremely drug-resistant (XDR), and pan-drug-resistant (PDR) Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa pose a huge clinical threat. This study reviews the impact of control groups on the association of antecedent antibiotic use and the acquisition of CR/XDR/PDR A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa.
Methods
Studies investigating the role of antibiotics as a risk factor for CR/XDR/PDR A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa acquisition in adult hospitalized patients from 1950 to 2016 were identified in the databases. These were divided into two groups: antibiotic-resistant versus antibiotic-sensitive pathogens (group I); antibiotic-resistant versus no infection (group II). A random-effects model was performed.
Results
Eighty-five studies (46 A. baumannii, 38 P. aeruginosa, and one of both) involving 22 396 patients were included. CR was investigated in 60 studies, XDR in 20 studies, and PDR in two studies. Prior antibiotic exposure was associated with significant acquisition of CR/XDR/PDR A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa in both groups I and II (p<0.05). Antibiotic classes implicated in both groups included aminoglycosides, carbapenems, glycopeptides, and penicillins. Cephalosporin use was not associated with resistance in either group. Fluoroquinolone exposure was only associated with resistance in group I but not group II.
Conclusions
Control groups play an important role in determining the magnitudes of risk estimates for risk factor studies, hence careful selection is necessary. Antibiotic exposure increases the acquisition of highly resistant A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, thus appropriate antibiotic use is imperative."

To quantify and assess trends and risk factors for loss to follow-up (LTFU) and delays before treatment initiation among bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients (laboratory-diagnosed) in Bulawayo, 2012–16.
Design
Cohort study using secondary programme data. Presumptive TB patients’ sputum samples were sent to the laboratory from the 19 primary health care clinics. Laboratory-diagnosed patients (microscopy or Xpert MTB/RIF) were tracked for treatment registration at the clinics.
Results
Of 2443 laboratory-diagnosed patients, the mean (standard deviation, SD) delay from sputum receipt at the laboratory to testing was 2.7(1.6) days and from testing to result dispatch was 8.8(5.8) days. A total of 508(20.8%) were LTFU which included 252(10.3%) deaths. While the number of laboratory-diagnosed patients reduced over years, there was a significant increase in pre-treatment LTFU and death. Independent predictors of pre-treatment LTFU were age above 65 years, male gender and HIV positive/unknown. In addition, delay (≥3 days) between sputum receipt and testing was significantly associated with pre-treatment death. Among registered patients (n=1935), the mean (SD) delay to initiate treatment was 29.1 (21.6) days which significantly declined over the years. Patients registered as new TB had significantly long treatment delay.
Conclusions
Interventions to mitigate the risk factors for high loss to follow-up, deaths and delays before TB treatment are urgently required."

abstract = "Background
Food-borne diseases are a major health problem in developing countries including Ethiopia. This study determined the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of Shigella and Salmonella among food handlers working in student and staff food service establishments at Debre Markos University.
Methods
A laboratory-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 220 food handlers from January 2015 to June 2016. Stool and fingernail samples from the subjects were cultured on bacteriological culture medium, and Shigella and Salmonella were isolated and identified following standard procedures. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for all isolates using the Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion method.
Results
The overall prevalence of Shigella and Salmonella in this study was 5.9%, with 3.6% of stool specimens testing positive for Salmonella species and 2.3% testing positive for Shigella species. None of the food handlers had positive cultures for Shigella or Salmonella in respect of their fingernail specimens. The isolation of either Shigella or Salmonella had a significant inverse relationship with the number of service years (p=0.017). All isolates of Shigella and Salmonella were 100% susceptible to ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and gentamicin. However, all isolated pathogens were resistant to ampicillin (100%).
Conclusions
The findings of this study highlight the importance of food handlers in the transmission of pathogens to the customers (students and the general population). Screening of food handlers, training for food handling and hand hygiene practices, and regular monitoring of the food handling practices should be done in order to avoid diseases that can be acquired through improper food handling, like bacterial infections."

This study was performed to investigate the epidemiology of bloodstream infection (BSI) in oncology patients at Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital (RCWMCH), Cape Town, with focus placed on the most common causes, complications, and antimicrobial susceptibilities in BSI.
Methods
A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in the Haematology–Oncology Unit of RCWMCH. All positive blood cultures from RCWMCH oncology patients obtained in 2012 to 2014 were retrieved to identify cases of BSI.
Results
Three hundred and forty-three positive cultures were identified, for 150 BSI episodes among 89 patients; 49.1% of the culture isolates were Gram-positive bacteria, 41.6% were Gram-negative bacteria, and 9.3% were fungal. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and viridans group Streptococcus were the most common Gram-positive isolates. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species were the most common Gram-negative isolates. The majority of BSI episodes occurred in patients with haematological malignancies (74%), in the presence of severe neutropenia (76.4%), and were associated with chemotherapy (88%). Complications occurred in 14% of BSI. Fungal infections had the highest prevalence of complications (21.4%). Three children died during BSI, giving a case-fatality rate of 2%.
Conclusions
BSI in these patients was caused mainly by Gram-positive bacteria and was associated with a low case-fatality rate. These results are consistent with worldwide experience of BSI in paediatric oncology."

Data on antimicrobial use among hospitalized children in Africa are very limited due to the absence of electronic prescription tracking.
Methods
This study evaluated antimicrobial consumption rates, the antimicrobial spectrum used, and the indications for therapy on a paediatric ward and in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. Antimicrobial prescription and patient demographic data were collected prospectively from May 10, 2015 to November 11, 2015. For the same period, data on antimicrobials dispensed and costs were extracted from the pharmacy electronic medicine management system. The volume of antimicrobials dispensed (dispensing data) was compared with observed antimicrobial use (prescription data).
Results
Of the 703 patients admitted, 415/451 (92%) paediatric ward admissions and 233/252 (92%) PICU admissions received ≥1 antimicrobials. On the ward, 89% of prescriptions were for community-acquired infections; 29% of PICU antimicrobials were prescribed for healthcare-associated infections. Ampicillin and third-generation cephalosporins were the most commonly prescribed agents. Antimicrobial costs were 67541 South African Rand (ZAR) (5680 United States Dollars (USD)) on the ward and 210484 ZAR (17702 USD) in the PICU. Ertapenem and meropenem were the single largest contributors to antimicrobial costs on the ward (43%) and PICU (30%), respectively. The volume of antimicrobials dispensed by the pharmacy (dispensing data) differed considerably from observed antimicrobial use (prescription data).
Conclusions
High rates of antimicrobial consumption were documented. Community-acquired infections were the main indication for prescription. Although pharmacy dispensing data did not closely approximate observed use, this represents a promising method for antimicrobial usage tracking in the future."

To evaluate adherence to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in a clinical trial of a population of men who have sex with men (MSM), to explore the influence of social psychology and objective factors (e.g., forgetting, too busy) on adherence, and to provide evidence for subsequent PrEP research.
Methods
This study analyzed the data from the daily medication group within a PrEP study (a randomized placebo-controlled trial of oral tenofovir among MSM in Western China from April 2013 to March 2015). A total of 331 participants were analyzed. PrEP adherence was self-reported by the subjects at every 3-month follow-up visit for 24 months. AIDS-related information including HIV prevention, transmission, and treatment knowledge, as well as PrEP-related motivation (including personal and social motivation) and behavior skills, i.e., self-efficacy, were collected using questionnaires. The objective reasons for non-adherence were collected during face-to-face follow-up visits every 3 months. A theoretical model of information motivation behavior skills (IMB) was constructed. Then confirmatory factor analysis was performed to test the fit of each IMB construct. Finally, the structure equation model was used to evaluate the IMB model.
Results
The median adherence rate was 64.29%. During the follow-up period, the percentage of high adherence (adherence ≥80%) was 32.33%, intermediate adherence (adherence 40–80%) was 38.97%, and low adherence (adherence ≤40%) was 28.70%. The final IMB model showed that there was no significant correlation between adherence to PrEP and the psychological constructs: information, motivation, and behavior skills. The main objective reasons for non-adherence were ‘forgetting to take medicine’ (70.21%), ‘too busy’ (29.08%), ‘worrying about side effects’ (28.01%), and ‘too much trouble’ (18.44%).
Conclusions
This study found no association between PrEP adherence and social psychological factors, and the main objective factor in non-adherence was forgetting to take the medicine. In the future, the MSM population could be reminded to take their medicine regularly using electronic devices, which may improve PrEP adherence to some extent and may further reduce the incidence of HIV. The strategy to improve PrEP adherence requires further study."

To assess the efficacy of praziquantel in children infected with Schistosoma haematobium over a 2-year period in the Ndumo area of uMkhanyakude District, South Africa.
Methods
This cohort study enrolled 173 school-going children in September 2017 who had participated in a baseline survey conducted in 2015 in the Ndumo area. Questionnaire interviews were conducted to collect information on the risk factors related to the transmission of schistosomiasis. The filtration technique was performed to detect Schistosoma haematobium eggs in urine. Infection intensity was classified as light or heavy. The Chi-square test was used to assess the associations between variables at the 95% confidence level, and p=0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Of the 173 participants screened 2 years post-treatment, 10 were infected. Six of these were new infection cases, while four were cases of re-infection. The intensity of infection had decreased significantly (p=0.001) at the time of the follow-up survey compared to the baseline survey. However, no significant difference was found among the risk factors for schistosomiasis 2 years later.
Conclusions
The prevalence of S. haematobium had decreased significantly in the cohort at 2 years post praziquantel treatment, during a period of persistent drought in the area. Risk factors that were significantly associated with schistosomiasis at baseline were no longer significantly associated at 2 years following treatment."

Biomarkers for tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis and clinical management are needed to defeat TB. In chronic hepatitis, patients not responding to interferon/ribavirin treatment had high levels of an antagonist form of IP-10. Recently, antagonist IP-10 has been shown to be involved also in TB pathogenesis. Here, we investigated IP-10 agonist/antagonist forms as potential inflammatory biomarkers to support TB diagnosis and monitoring.
Methods
Total IP-10 and its agonist/antagonist forms were measured by SIMOA digital ELISA in urine obtained from patients with active TB at baseline and after treatment. Healthy donors (HD) and patients with pneumonia were enrolled as controls.
Results
Patients with active TB had significantly higher levels of total and agonist IP-10 at baseline compared to HD; conversely, no differences were observed between IP-10 levels in active TB vs pneumonia. Moreover, in active TB a decline of total urine IP-10 was observed at therapy completion; agonist/antagonist forms reflected this decline although their differences were not statistically significant.
Conclusions
We showed for the first time that agonist/antagonist IP-10 forms are measurable in urine. IP-10 levels associate with TB and pneumonia disease, suggesting their association with acute inflammation. Further studies are needed to assess their role to monitor TB treatment efficacy."

This paper explores and reports the major drivers of AMR that were present in Syria pre-conflict and those that have emerged since its onset in March 2011. Drivers that existed before the conflict included a lack of enforcement of existing legislation to regulate over-the-counter antibiotics and notification of communicable diseases. This contributed to a number of drivers of AMR after the onset of conflict, and these were also compounded by the exodus of trained staff, the increase in overcrowding and unsanitary conditions, the increase in injuries, and economic sanctions limiting the availability of required laboratory medical materials and equipment. Addressing AMR in this context requires pragmatic, multifaceted action at the local, regional, and international levels to detect and manage potentially high rates of multidrug-resistant infections. Priorities are (1) the development of a competent surveillance system for hospital-acquired infections, (2) antimicrobial stewardship, and (3) the creation of cost-effective and implementable infection control policies. However, it is only by addressing the conflict and immediate cessation of the targeting of health facilities that the rehabilitation of the health system, which is key to addressing AMR in this context, can progress."

Diarrheal illnesses in young children cause morbidity and preventable deaths in developing countries. We evaluated two high doses of Salovum® [Antisecretory Factor] to treat diarrhea in young children and followed up for recurrence 6 weeks post treatment.
Methods
Forty children, 6-24 months old, admitted with acute diarrhea, to the Outpatient Department of Children’s Hospital in Lahore, Pakistan were selected. The patients were randomly allocated to either Group A given 2 sachets, or to Group B, given 4 sachets. Each sachet contained 4gram of Salovum® and was mixed with Oral Rehydration Salt solution. This mixture was administered perorally within the first 30min of treatment. The trained nursing staff observed them for number of stools and consistency over every half hour for a total of 4hours. Follow up for 6 weeks was done daily by telephone, or visits by the mothers. The results demonstrate that Salovum provides a protective effect irrespective of the diarrhea causes.
Results
Group B, given 4 sachets of Salovum® showed improved fecal consistency in 80% of the children compared to 50% in Group A within 30minutes of treatment, p=0.004. The number of diarrheal stools decreased over this time from seven to one/two over 4hours in the two groups [p=0.234]. None of the children showed a recurrence of diarrhea over the follow up period.

abstract = "Background
Historically, semi-closed populations have had high rates of meningococcal carriage and have experienced recurrent outbreaks. As such, these high-risk groups are recommended for targeted vaccination in many countries.
Methods
A systematic review of eight databases and Google Scholar forward citations was conducted to characterize serogroup-specific meningococcal carriage in university students, military personnel, and Hajj pilgrims from 2007 to 2016.
Results
A total of 7014 records were identified and 22 studies were included. Overall carriage ranged from 0.0% to 27.4% in Hajj pilgrims, from 1.5% to 71.1% in university students, and from 4.2% to 15.2% in military personnel. Among serogroups A, B, C, W, X, and Y, serogroup B was most prevalent in Hajj pilgrims, B and Y in university students, and B, C, and Y in military personnel. ‘Other’ serogroups were more prevalent in university students than Hajj pilgrims or military personnel. Risk factors for carriage varied by setting. Among Hajj pilgrims, a high endemicity in the country of origin increased the risk of carriage, while smoking, male sex, and frequently attending parties increased the carriage risk for university students. Similarly, smoking increased the carriage risk for professional soldiers. Data gaps remain for many regions.
Conclusions
Preventative vaccination policies for high-risk groups should be based on current disease data in individual countries, supplemented by carriage data. Meningococcal carriage studies and disease surveillance are critical for determining the local epidemiology, populations responsible for disease transmission, and the need for targeted vaccination."

We aimed to report virulence-associated genes and molecular characteristics of non-O1/non-O139 Vibrio cholerae isolated from hepatitis B cirrhosis patients in China.
Methods
Patient clinical data including course of disease, laboratory tests, antibiotic treatment and outcomes were collected. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed and virulence-associated genes were detected by PCR. Genetic relatedness among non-O1/non-O139 V. cholerae strains was investigated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST).
Results
All three strains in this study harbored pathogenicity related genes like rtxA, rtxC, toxR, hapA, hlyA and ompW whereas they lacked ctxA, ctxB, tcpA, ompU and zot genes. None of them showed resistance to any antibiotic detected. A new allele of gyrB was submitted to the MLST database and designated as 97. Two novel sequence types (ST518 and ST519) and ST271 were identified by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). PFGE indicated considerable diversity among three non-O1/non-O139 V. cholerae strains.

Three sporadic cases highlight that non-O1/non-O139 V. cholerae can cause opportunistic invasiveness infection in cirrhosis patients. Pathogenicity may be related to virulence-associated genes. Timely detection and antibiotic therapy should be paid more attention to in clinic."

abstract = "Objectives
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) clearance rate (fclearance) is defined as the proportion of infected persons who will spontaneously clear their infection after acute infection. We aimed to estimate fclearance using a novel approach that avoids limitations in existing estimates, and to clarify the link between fclearance and HCV viremic rate—the latter being the proportion of RNA positivity among those antibody positive.
Methods
A mathematical model was developed to describe HCV transmission. fclearance was estimated by fitting the model to probability-based and nationally representative population-based data for Egypt (Egypt 2008 and Egypt 2015) and USA (NHANES A and NHANES B). Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were conducted.
Results
fclearance was estimated at 39.9% (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 34.3%–46.4%) and 33.5% (95% UI: 29.2%–38.3%) for Egypt 2008 and Egypt 2015 data, respectively; and at 29.6% (23.0%–37.1%) and 39.9% (31.2%–51.0%) for NHANES A and NHANES B data, respectively. fclearance was found related to HCV viremic rate through (approximately) the formula fclearance=1.16 (1−HCV viremic rate). HCV viremic rate was higher with higher risk of HCV exposure. Robustness of results was demonstrated in uncertainty and sensitivity analyses.
Conclusion
One-third of HCV-infected persons clear their infection spontaneously, higher than earlier estimates—the immune-system capacity to clear HCV infection may have been underestimated."

The study aimed to describe the epidemiological, microbiological, and clinical features of a population sample of 17 patients with HACEK infective endocarditis (HACEK-IE) and to compare them with matched control patients with IE caused by viridans group streptococci (VGS-IE).
Methods
Cases of definite (n=14, 82.2%) and possible (n=3, 17.6%) HACEK-IE included in the Infective Endocarditis Hospital Clinic of Barcelona (IE-HCB) database between 1979 and 2016 were identified and described. Furthermore, a retrospective case–control analysis was performed, matching each case to three control subjects with VGS-IE registered in the same database during the same time period.
Results
Seventeen out of 1209 IE cases (1.3%, 95% confidence interval 0.69–1.91%) were due to HACEK group organisms. The most frequently isolated HACEK species were Aggregatibacter spp (n=11, 64.7%). Intracardiac vegetations were present in 70.6% of cases. Left heart failure (LHF) was present in 29.4% of cases. Ten patients (58.8%) required in-hospital surgery and none died during hospitalization. In the case–control analysis, there was a trend towards larger vegetations in the HACEK-IE group (median (interquartile range) size 11.5 (10.0–20.0) mm vs. 9.0 (7.0–13.0) mm; p=0.068). Clinical manifestations, echocardiographic findings, LHF rate, systemic emboli, and other complications were all comparable (p>0.05). In-hospital surgery and mortality were similar in the two groups. One-year mortality was lower for HACEK-IE (1/17 vs. to 6/48; p=0.006).
Conclusions
HACEK-IE represented 1.3% of all IE cases. Clinical features and outcomes were comparable to those of the VGS-IE control group. Despite the trend towards a larger vegetation size, the embolic event rate was not higher and the 1-year mortality was significantly lower for HACEK-IE."

The primary objective was to determine the association between histopathological and microbiological findings in patients clinically suspected to have tuberculous lymphadenitis. A secondary objective was to assess the diagnostic utility of GeneXpert in lymph node specimens.
Method
This was a single-centre prospective cohort study, performed in the Infectious Disease Clinic at The Indus Hospital. Three hundred and forty-one adult patients with chronically enlarged, accessible lymph nodes were enrolled after obtaining verbal consent, between February 2013 and April 2016. Tissue specimens were processed for histopathology, acid-fast bacillus (AFB) microscopy, AFB culture, and GeneXpert. Based on these results, anti-tuberculosis therapy (ATT) was prescribed. Clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes were recorded.
Results
There were 297 evaluable patients; 74.4% were diagnosed with tuberculous lymphadenitis (TBLA), 6.7% with a malignancy, and 12.8% with reactive nodes. TBLA was diagnosed on suggestive histopathology in 89.6% of cases, followed by GeneXpert (32.6%), mycobacterial culture (26.6%), and AFB smear positivity (12.5%). The sensitivity of GeneXpert was 65.7% when assessed against AFB culture. Drug resistance was displayed by 8.2% of GeneXpert-positive cases and 11.7% of culture-positive cases. The majority of TBLA patients (88.7%) responded favorably to ATT.
Conclusions
In light of laboratory evidence, a quarter of patients suspected of TBLA had an alternative diagnosis, highlighting its importance in avoiding over-treatment and diagnostic delays in malignancy. Although sensitivity is poor, the demonstration of drug resistance by both GeneXpert and AFB culture represents a useful tool to guide treatment."

A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted using individual participant data. Survival analysis and the Cox proportional hazards regression model with random effects to adjust for covariates were applied. The protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO; CRD42012002162).
Results
A total of 27 studies (1296 subjects) conducted in eight countries were included. The risk of bias was low for all domains in 17 studies (63.0%). Nine hundred and thirteen subjects were assessed (149 seroreversion events, 83.7% censored data) for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), 670 subjects (134 events, 80.0% censored) for indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIF), and 548 subjects (99 events, 82.0% censored) for indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA). A higher probability of seroreversion was observed within a shorter time span in subjects aged 1–19 years compared to adults. The chance of seroreversion also varied according to the country where the infection might have been acquired. For instance, the pooled adjusted hazard ratio between children/adolescents and adults for the IIF test was 1.54 (95% confidence interval 0.64–3.71) for certain countries of South America (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Paraguay) and 9.37 (95% confidence interval 3.44–25.50) for Brazil.

abstract = "Objective
In resource-limited tuberculosis-endemic countries, Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sputum is mainly detected by acid-fast bacillus (AFB) staining and the identification of sputum-derived cultures. PCR techniques are practical only in well-resourced laboratories. This study investigated the application of a rapid, simple, and inexpensive fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay to identify and differentiate M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) from non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) in sputum.
Methods
The Mycobacterium/Nocardia Genus (MN Genus)-MTBC FISH assay performed in this study utilizes two different DNA probes labeled with different fluorescent molecules that hybridize respectively with 16S rRNA of the genus Mycobacterium and 23S rRNA of MTBC. The assay was tested on 202 patient sputum samples in Mangaluru, Karnataka State, India. Sputa were first liquefied and bacteria concentrated before performing the FISH assay and parallel culturing and AFB staining. The identities of cultured bacteria from DNA sequencing were compared with FISH assay findings from corresponding sputa.
Results
Of the 202 sputum samples tested, 67 reacted with both MN Genus-specific and MTBC-specific probes, none reacted only with the MTBC-specific probe, and 22 reacted only with the MN Genus-specific probe. The FISH assay yielded results in 2h and had a limit of detection of 2.2×104CFU/ml in sputum spiked with cultured M. tuberculosis. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the FISH assay for MTBC in patient sputa were 89.7%, 95.5%, 88.0%, and 92.6%, respectively. NTM were a significant cause of tuberculosis-like infections in Mangaluru.
Conclusions
The MN Genus-MTBC dual probe fluorescence FISH assay previously applied to cultures can also be utilized in resource-limited tuberculosis-endemic countries for rapidly identifying and differentiating MTBC and NTM in sputum samples."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetic profile and safety of voriconazole treatment in patients with Child–Pugh class B and C cirrhosis.
Methods
Liver cirrhosis patients who had received the recommended voriconazole maintenance dose (group A) or halved maintenance dose (group B), orally or intravenously, were included. Voriconazole-related adverse events (AEs) were defined according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.
Results
A total of 110 trough plasma concentrations of voriconazole (Cmin) were measured in 78 patients. There was a significant difference in voriconazole Cmin between group A and group B (Cmin, 6.95±3.42mg/l vs. 4.02±2.00mg/l; p<0.001). No significant difference in voriconazole Cmin between Child–Pugh class B and C cirrhosis patients was observed in either of the two groups. The international normalized ratio and co-medication with a CYP2C19 inhibitor had a significant effect on voriconazole Cmin in group B. The incidence of AEs in group A was 26.5% and in group B was 15.9%, and 87.5% of AEs developed within 7days after starting voriconazole treatment.
Conclusions
These results suggest that the recommended dose and halved maintenance dose may be inappropriate in patients with Child–Pugh class B and C cirrhosis due to the high Cmin, and that voriconazole Cmin should be monitored earlier to avoid AEs."

Considerable efforts have been devoted so far to improve salvage procedures of infected breast implants in absence of defined guidelines or validated clinical protocols. Within a cohort of prospectively recruited patients who underwent breast reconstruction, we performed a retrospective review of proven implant infections in order to describe factors contributing to management success.
Methods
We collected data in 1293 consecutive patients who underwent two stage (expander+prosthesis) breast reconstruction with at least 12 months of follow-up. Demographic data, timing of infection, type of microorganism, intent of salvage, fate of the implant, type of antibiotic treatment and follow-up were recorded in a prospective data collection on clinical records.
Results
Implant infections occurred in 103 of 1293 patients (8%). Among these, 73 (71%) were proven infections with confirmed microbiology. Implant pocket salvage was attempted in 43/73 (59%). patients A higher proportion of expander implant pockets were successfully saved compared to prosthetic pocket (p=0,04). Gram-positive microrganisms represented the majority of etiologic agents, with coagulase negative staphylococci prevailing over Staphylococcus aureus. No association was observed between success rate and type of infecting microorganism. A higher proportion of patients with previous or intraoperative radiotherapy or with perioperative chemotherapy underwent an attempt of implant salvage (p=0,081 and 0,0571 trend, respectively). No single antibiotic regimen was superior to the others in terms of success rate. Implant pocket salvage was higher in expanders compared to prostheses (74% vs 33% p=0,04). Higher success rates in implant pocket salvage were evident when implant replacement was preceded and followed by antibiotic treatment compared to inpatient antibiotic treatment alone (100% versus 57%, p=0,035).
Conclusion
Patient selection in clinical practice leads to differences in patients with breast implant infection who are considered for attempts at implant salvage vs. those who are treated with implant removal. Salvage of breast implant pockets can be obtained in the majority of patients with combined one-step implant replacement surgery and antibiotic treatment. Increased efforts and protocols to recruit patients into pocket salvage management are needed."

abstract = "Background
Rubella and its associated congenital anomalies have been greatly reduced in most developed countries through use of the rubella vaccine. However, the magnitude of the problem is underestimated and there are no well-established rubella/congenital rubella syndrome prevention and control strategies in many developing countries, including Ethiopia. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of rubella virus infections among pregnant women and their immune status before the introduction of rubella vaccine in Amhara Regional State, Ethiopia.
Methods
A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted among pregnant women in Dessie, Felege-Hiwot, and University of Gondar referral hospitals, from December 2015 to February 2017. After obtaining written informed consent, socio-demographic data, reproductive history, clinical manifestations, and the possible risk factors for rubella virus infections were collected using a structured questionnaire. The laboratory analysis of rubella-specific antibodies was done using an enzyme-linked immunoassay method on venous blood samples. Data were entered and analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 20. Binary logistic regression was used to determine the strength of association between the dependent variables and covariates.
Results
A total of 600 pregnant women were included in the study. Their mean age was 26.4±5years (range 16–40 years). The overall seroprevalence of rubella infection was 89%. Of the total study participants, 9.5% were positive for rubella-specific IgM antibody, which indicates acute/recent rubella virus infection. In contrast, 79.5% of them had protective levels of rubella-specific IgG antibody and were immune as a result of previous wild-type rubella infection. However, 11% of the pregnant women were negative for both rubella-specific antibodies; these women represent the susceptible group.
Conclusions
A large number of pregnant women had acute/recent rubella virus infections at the time of data collection, indicating that the virus is endemic in the study area. More than a tenth of pregnant women were found to be susceptible to acquiring the infection in future pregnancies, with the possible risk of rubella-associated congenital anomalies. Hence screening of all women of child-bearing age before conception and during pregnancy might reduce the devastating effects of the virus on the developing fetus."

Results
Sixty studies met inclusion criteria. In 65 pregnancies from 28 case reports and 9 small case series (<10 women), there were 20 spontaneous abortions (SAs) (31%), 2 intra-uterine fetal deaths (IUFDs) (3%) and 11 cases of congenital brucellosis (17%). In 14 larger case series there were 181 SAs in 679 pregnancies (27%), 19 IUFDs in 458 pregnancies (4%), and 44 preterm infants (12%) plus 6 infants with congenital brucellosis (2%) in 362 pregnancies. SA, IUFD and preterm delivery incidence were increased with meta-analysis of the 5 case series with controls. Nine studies described brucellosis seroprevalence with adverse pregnancy outcomes with no increased seroprevalence in the two studies with controls.

For Ebola vaccine development, antibody response is a major endpoint although its determinants are not well known. We aimed to review Ebola vaccine studies and to assess factors associated with antibody response variability in humans.
Methods
We searched PubMed and Scopus for preventive Ebola vaccine studies in humans or non-human primates (NHP), published up to February 2018. For each vaccination group with Ebola Zaire antibody titre measurements after vaccination, data about antibody response and its potential determinants were extracted. A random-effects meta-regression was conducted including human groups with at least 8 individuals.
Results
We reviewed 49 studies (202 vaccination groups including 74 human groups) with various vaccine platforms and antigen inserts. Mean antibody titre was slightly higher in NHP (3.10, 95% confidence interval [293; 327]) than in humans (2.75 [257; 293]). Vaccine platform (p<0·001) and viral strain used for antibody detection (p<0·001) were associated with antibody response in humans, but adjusted heterogeneity remained at 95%.
Conclusions
Various platforms have been evaluated in humans, including Ad26, Ad5, ChimpAd3, DNA, MVA, and VSV. In addition to platforms, viral strain used for antibody detection influences antibody response. However, variability remained mostly unexplained. Therefore, comparison of vaccine immunogenicity needs randomised controlled trials."

To develop and validate a pre-hospital decision support system (DSS) for the emergency medical services (EMS), enabling the identification and steering of patients with critical infectious conditions (i.e., severe respiratory tract infections, severe central nervous system (CNS) infections, and sepsis) to a specialized emergency department (ED) for infectious diseases.
Methods
The development process involved four consecutive steps. The first step was gathering data from the electronic patient care record system (ePCR) on patients transported by the EMS, in order to identify retrospectively appropriate patient categories for steering. The second step was to let a group of medical experts give advice and suggestions for further development of the DSS. The third and fourth steps were the evaluation and validation, respectively, of the whole pre-hospital DSS in a pilot study.
Results
A pre-hospital decision support tool (DST) was developed for three medical conditions: severe respiratory infection, severe CNS infection, and sepsis. The pilot study included 72 patients, of whom 60% were triaged to a highly specialized emergency department (ED-Spec) with an attending infectious disease physician (ID physician). The results demonstrated that the pre-hospital emergency nurses (PENs) adhered to the DST in 66 of 72 patient cases (91.6%). For those patients steered to the ED-Spec, the assessment made by PENs and the ID physician at the ED was concordant in 94% of cases.
Conclusions
The development of a specific DSS aiming to identify patients with three different severe infectious diseases appears to give accurate decision support to PENs when steering patients to the optimal level of care."

Environmental enteropathy is prevalent in low-income countries, although its aetiology is unknown. We investigated if Mycobacterium avium antigens, which are commonly found in the environment, could contribute to its pathogenesis in a population known to have widespread environmental enteropathy.
Methods
Routine endoscopy patients at the University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka whose endoscopy results were normal submitted duodenal biopsies and whole blood samples. Samples were stimulated with M. avium lysate over 24h while unstimulated samples served as negative controls. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and cytokine response in supernatants were quantified using ELISA and cytometric bead array.
Results
Samples from 48 patients (56% women) were analysed, with a median age of 35 years (IQR 27.5, 50.5). M. avium induced the secretion of a wide-range of Th1, Th2 and Th17 cytokines in blood but only IL-1β and IL-6 in duodenal tissue. However it differentially induced the secretion of MMP-1 in duodenal tissue compared to negative controls (p=0.004). A similar MMP-1 response but with lower concentrations was observed in blood.
Conclusion
The induction of MMP-1 and cytokines by M. avium in duodenal tissue suggests that environmental mycobacteria could contribute to the epithelial disruption seen in environmental enteropathy, and a need to further explore possible biomarkers that may predict this exposure in at-risk populations."

Myanmar is a World Health Organization high tuberculosis (TB) burden country with a high multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB burden. Of significance, a high prevalence of the Beijing genotype of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) among MDR-MTB has been reported previously. A detailed genetic characterization of TB clinical isolates was performed in order to explore whether there is an association between the prevalence of the Beijing MTB genotype and MDR-TB in Myanmar.
Methods
A total of 265 MDR-MTB clinical isolates collected in 2010 and 2012 were subjected to spoligotyping, mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit–variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) analysis, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing, and drug resistance-associated gene sequencing, including rpoC to detect potential compensatory evolution.
Results
Of the total MDR-MTB isolates, 79.2% (210/265) were of the Beijing genotype, the majority of which were the ‘modern’ subtype. Beijing genotype isolates were differentiated by 15-locus MIRU-VNTR and a high clustering rate (53.0%) was observed in the modern subtype. These MIRU-VNTR patterns were similar to Beijing genotype clones spreading across Russia and Central Asia. A high prevalence of katG Ser315Thr, and genetic evidence of extensive drug resistance (XDR) and pre-XDR and compensatory mutations in rpoC were observed among clustered isolates.
Conclusions
MDR-MTB strains of the Beijing genotype might be spreading in Myanmar and present a major challenge to TB control in this country."

abstract = "Objective
Spatial patterns and environmental and socio-economic risk factors of dengue fever have been studied widely on a coarse scale; however, there are few such quantitative studies on a fine scale. There is a need to investigate these factors on a fine scale for dengue fever.
Methods
In this study, a dataset of dengue fever cases and environmental and socio-economic factors was constructed at 1-km spatial resolution, in particular ‘land types’ (LT), obtained from the first high resolution remote sensing satellite launched from China (GF-1 satellite), and ‘land surface temperature’, obtained from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. Spatial analysis methods, including point density, average nearest neighbor, spatial autocorrelation, and hot spot analysis, were used to analyze spatial patterns of dengue fever. Spearman rank correlation and ordinary least squares (OLS) were used to explore associated environmental and socio-economic risk factors of dengue fever in five districts of Guangzhou City, China in 2014.
Results
A total of 30553 dengue fever cases were reported in the districts of Baiyun, Haizhu, Yuexiu, Liwan, and Tianhe of Guangzhou, China in 2014. Dengue fever cases showed strong seasonal variation. The cases from August to October accounted for 96.3% of the total cases in 2014. The top three districts for dengue fever morbidity were Baiyun (1.32%), Liwan (0.62%), and Haizhu (0.60%). Strong spatial clusters of dengue fever cases were observed. Areas of high density for dengue fever were located at the district junctions. The dengue fever outbreak was significantly correlated with LT, normalized difference water index (NDWI), land surface temperature of daytime (LSTD), land surface temperature of nighttime (LSTN), population density (PD), and gross domestic product (GDP) (correlation coefficients of 0.483, 0.456, 0.612, 0.699, 0.705, and 0.205, respectively). The OLS equation was built with dengue fever cases as the dependent variable and LT, LSTN, and PD as explanatory variables. The residuals were not spatially autocorrelated. The adjusted R-squared was 0.320.
Conclusions
The findings of spatio-temporal patterns and risk factors of dengue fever can provide scientific information for public health practitioners to formulate targeted, strategic plans and implement effective public health prevention and control measures."

Methods
We conducted a prospective observational study at a cancer referral center from August 2016 to July 2017, which included all BSI.
Results
4220 patients were tested with blood cultures; 496 were included. Mean age was 48 years. In 299 patients with solid tumors, secondary BSI and Central Line-Associated BSI (CLABSI) were the most common (55.9% and 31.8%, respectively). In 197 hematologic patients, primary and mucosal barrier injury (MBI) BSI were the main type (38.6%). Gram-negative were the most frequent bacteria (72.8%), with Escherichia coli occupying the first place (n=210, 42.3%), 48% were Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) producers, and 1.8% were resistant to carbapenems. Mortality at day 30, was 22%, but reached 70% when patients did not receive an appropriate antimicrobial treatment. Multivariate analysis showed that progression or relapse of the oncologic disease, inappropriate antimicrobial treatment, and having resistant bacteria were independently associated with 30-day mortality.
Conclusions
Emergence of MDR bacteria is an important healthcare problem worldwide. Patients with BSI, particularly those patients with MDR bacteria have a higher mortality risk."

Influenza A(H7N9) virus is known for its high pathogenicity in human. A family cluster of influenza A(H7N9) virus infection was identified in Suzhou, China. This study aimed to investigate the possibility of human-to-human transmission of the virus and examine the virologic features of this family cluster.
Methods
The clinical and epidemiologic data of two patients in the family cluster of influenza A(H7N9) virus infection were collected. Viral RNA in samples derived from the two patients, their close contacts, and the environments with likely influenza A(H7N9) virus transmission were tested by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay was used to detect virus-specific antibodies. Genetic sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were also performed.
Results
The index patient (Case 1), a 66-year old man, was virologically diagnosed with influenza A(H7N9) virus infection 12days after experiencing influenza-like symptoms, then died of multi-organ failure. His 39-year old daughter (Case 2), denying any other exposure to influenza A(H7N9) virus, became infected with influenza A(H7N9) virus following taking care of her father during his illness. Sequencing viral genomes isolated from the two patients showed nearly identical nucleotide sequence, and genetically resembled the viral genome isolated from a chicken in the wet market where the index patient once visited. All three influenza A(H7N9) viruses shared S138A, G186V, Q226L mutations in HA (H3) protein and a single basic amino acid (PEIPKGR↓G) at the cleavage site.
Conclusions
Human-to-human transmission of influenza A(H7N9) virus most likely occurred in this household. The three-amino-acid mutations in HA protein were discovered in this study, which might have increased the binding affinity of influenza A(H7N9) virus to the receptor on trachea epithelial cells to facilitate viral transmission among humans."

A retrospective observational study design was used to assess the use and costs of diagnostic tests and antimicrobial treatment and the total hospitalization costs for adult patients with suspected ME, who received a lumbar puncture procedure during an emergency department visit or during the first two service days of an inpatient stay. Related costs were calculated by timing of lumbar puncture performed and infectious etiology.
Results
A total 26429 adult patients with suspected ME diagnosed between 2011 and 2014 were included in the study. The mean hospitalization cost was $15 572±27168, with antimicrobial medication cost of $1144±4052 and laboratory test cost of $210±244. The total visit cost increased with delayed lumbar puncture procedure, intensive care unit stay, and if the etiology was fungi, arbovirus, or bacteria.
Conclusions
Higher diagnostic and treatment costs are associated with a delayed lumbar puncture procedure, the etiological agent, and the requirement for an intensive care unit stay."

CD4+CXCR5+ T cells have previously been established. However, their decreased frequency during tuberculosis (TB) disease is only partially understood. The aim of this study was to explore the depletion of CD4+CXCR5+ T cells in human TB.
Methods
The frequency and function of CD4+CXCR5+ T cells were evaluated in active TB (ATB) patients and healthy control subjects. The function of CD4+CXCR5+ T cells was determined after blockade of inhibitory receptors.
Results
The frequency of CD4+CXCR5+ T cells was decreased in ATB patients. The expression of activation markers (HLA-DR and ICOS) and inhibitory receptors (Tim-3 and PD-1) on CD4+CXCR5+ T cells was increased in the ATB group. TB-specific antigen stimulation induced higher expression of inhibitory receptors than phytohemagglutinin stimulation in the ATB group. In contrast, TB antigen stimulation did not induce a significantly increased expression of IL-21 and Ki-67 on CD4+CXCR5+ T cells. However, blockade of inhibitory receptors Tim-3 and PD-1 not only increased the frequency of CD4+CXCR5+ T cells, but also restored their proliferation and cytokine secretion potential.
Conclusions
The increased expression of inhibitory receptors involves the depletion of CD4+CXCR5+ T cells, and blockade of inhibitory receptors can restore the function of CD4+CXCR5+ T cells in ATB patients."

Monthly indigenous dengue cases in 2005-2017 were aggregated at county level. Spatiotemporal cluster analysis was used to explore dengue distribution features using SaTScan9.4.4 and Arcgis10.3.0. In addition, the influential factors and potential high risk areas of dengue outbreaks were analyzed using ecological niche models in Maxent 3.3.1 software.
Results
We found a heterogeneous spatial and temporal distribution pattern of dengue cases. The identified high risk region in the primary cluster covered 13 counties in Guangdong Province and in the secondary clusters included 14 counties in Yunnan Province. Additionally, there was a nonlinear association between meteorological and environmental factors and dengue outbreaks, with 8.5%–57.1%, 6.7%–38.3% and 3.2%–40.4% contribution from annual average minimum temperature, land cover and annual average precipitation, respectively.
Conclusions
The high risk areas of dengue outbreaks mainly are located in Guangdong and Yunnan Provinces, which are significantly shaped by environmental and meteorological factors, such as temperature, precipitation and land cover."

The example of the Syrian conflict is used to explore the feasibility of using existing global policies on AMR in conditions of extreme conflict. The available literature on AMR and prescribing behaviour in Syria before and since the onset of the conflict in March 2011 was identified. Overall, there is a paucity of rigorous data before and since the onset of conflict in Syria to contextualize the burden of AMR. However, post onset of the conflict, an increasing number of studies conducted in neighbouring countries and Europe have reported AMR in Syrian refugees. High rates of multidrug resistance, particularly Gram-negative organisms, have been noted amongst Syrian refugees when compared with local populations. Conflict impedes many of the safeguards against AMR, creates new drivers, and exacerbates existing ones. Given the apparently high rates of AMR in Syria, in neighbouring countries hosting refugees, and in European countries providing asylum, this requires the World Health Organization and other global health institutions to address the causes, costs, and future considerations of conflict-related AMR as an issue of global governance."

Direct acting antivirals (DAAs) are highly effective for treatment of hepatitis C (HCV) but brand products are priced beyond the means of most low and middle income countries (LMICs). Although a few DAAs are offered at reduced prices in access programs, they are still beyond affordability in limited resource settings with a large HCV infected population. Cheap generics might fill this economic need, but studies comparing their clinical efficacy to that of original products are limited.
Aim
To compare efficacy of brand and generic DAAs used in the national treatment program in Egypt.
Methods
HCV treatment eligible patients (n=971) were enrolled. They were treated with 12 weeks of either sofosbuvir-daclatasvir (SOF-DCV) or SOF-ledipasvir (SOF-LDV). Ribavirin (RBV) was added to patients with cirrhosis and to SOF experienced patients. Patients with cirrhosis who were RBV intolerant were treated for 24 weeks without RBV.
Results
Most patients were males (61.4%), treatment naïve (88.6%), without cirrhosis (61.7%), and the mean age was 51.3±11.31 years. Baseline characteristics were not different in patients treated with brand or generic medications regarding age, liver tests, creatinine, platelets, MELD score, baseline HCV-RNA and transient elastography. Overall sustained virologic response (SVR) rate was 98.1%, which was similar for generic and brand drugs (98.2% vs. 98.1%; p=1), and similar with both regimens used (SOF-DCV±RBV: brand: 98.1%, generic 97.8%; p=0.729, SOF-LDV±RBV: brand 98.2%, generic 100%; p=0.729). AST and ALT decreased significantly with initiation of therapy with both generic and original drugs.
Conclusion
Generic and brand DAAs are equally effective for achieving SVR and improving aminotransferases."

Despite the fact that vaccination is an effective primary prevention strategy for the containment of influenza outbreaks, health policymakers have shown great concern over the enormous costs involved in universal immunization, particularly when resources are limited.
Methods
A two-arm cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) was conducted that took into account the aspect of herd immunity. The analysis used a study cohort of 100000 residents with a demographic make-up identical to that of the underlying population in Taipei County, Taiwan, during the epidemic influenza season of 2001–2002. The parameters embedded in the dynamic process of infection were estimated through the application of the newly proposed susceptible–infection–complication–recovery (SICR) model to the empirical data, in order to compute the number of deaths and complications averted due to universal vaccination compared to no vaccination. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) given maximum amount of willingness-to-pay (WTP) were calculated to delineate the results of the two-arm CEA.
Results
The incremental costs involved in the vaccinated group as compared to the unvaccinated group were $1195 to reduce one additional complication and $805 to avert one additional death, allowing for herd immunity. The corresponding figures were higher for the results without considering herd immunity. Given the ceiling ratio of WTP equal to $10000 (approximately two-thirds of GDP), the probability of the vaccination being cost-effective for averting death was 100% and for averting complications was 96.7%.
Conclusions
Universal vaccination against seasonal influenza was found to be very cost-effective, particularly when herd immunity is considered. The probability of being cost-effective was almost certain given the maximum amount of WTP within two-thirds of the GDP."

In infants <3 months old, GBS (46.5%) and E. coli (23.3%) were most common; in children >3 months old, S. pneumoniae (54.7%), which had a penicillin non-susceptibility rate of 55.4% (36/65), was most frequent. The resistance rates of S. pneumoniae and E. coli to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone were 14.0%/40.0% and 11.3%/68.4%, respectively. All GBS isolates were sensitive to penicillin.
Conclusions
The occurrence of BM peaked in the first year of life, while S. pneumoniae was the predominant pathogen in children >3months of old. The antibiotic resistance of S. pneumoniae was a concern."

abstract = "Background
Denmark has a high incidence rate of candidaemia. A Nordic study suggested a higher Danish prevalence of haematological malignancies as an underlying reason. This nationwide study ascertained clinical characteristics of Danish candidaemia patients and investigated potential factors contributing to the high incidence and mortality.
Methods
Microbiological and clinical data for candidaemia patients in 2010-2011 were retrieved. 30-day mortality was estimated by hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI, Cox regression).
Results
Data were available for 912/973 candidaemia episodes (93.7%). Intensive care unit (ICU) held the largest share of patients (43.2%). Prevalent host factors were multi-morbidity (≥2 underlying diseases, 74.2%) and gastrointestinal disease (52.5%). Haematological disease was infrequent (7.8%). Risk factors included antibiotic exposure (90.5%), CVC (71.9%) and Candida colonisation (66.7%). 30-day mortality was 43.4%, and 53.6% in ICU. Mortality was lower for patients with recent abdominal surgery (HR 0.70, 95% CI: 0.54-0.92).
Conclusion
A substantial prevalence of multi-morbidity and a high 30-day mortality was found. We hypothesise, that an increasing population of severely ill patients with prolonged supportive treatment and microbiological testing may in part explain the high candidaemia incidence in Denmark. Nationwide studies are warranted to clarify this issue."

Influenza is a common childhood disease and protecting children by predicting the positive rate of influenza virus is important as vaccines are not routinely administered in China. Our study aims to describe the epidemiology of influenza viruses among children in Wuhan, China during the past nine influenza seasons (2007–2015) and to predict the positive rate of different types of influenza virus in the future.
Methods
During the last nine influenza seasons (2007–2015), a total of 10,232 nasopharyngeal swabs collected from pediatric outpatients (age <15years) with influenza-like illness (ILI) infections in two sentinel children’s hospitals were examined for influenza A and B by real-time one step RT-PCR. An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was used to fit the time series and to predict the future (first half of 2016) positive rates of different types of influenza virus.
Results
A total of 1,341 specimens were positive for influenza A and 490 for influenza B. The majority of infected patients were 1–11 years old (87.7%). The ARIMA model could effectively predict the positive rate of influenza virus in a short time. ARIMA(0,0,11), SARIMA(1,0,0)(0,1,1)12, ARIMA(0,0,1) and SARIMA(0,0,1)(1,0,1)12 were suitable for B(Victoria), B(Yamagata), A(H1N1)pdm09, and A(H3N2), respectively.
Conclusion
Additional policies must be formulated to prevent and control influenza. The wide use of influenza vaccines, especially for influenza B, especially for influenza B(Yamagata) and B(Victoria), can potentially reduce the effects of influenza on children of China."

Methods
Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected whenever an elderly had symptoms of acute respiratory infections (ARI). PCR and RT-PCR were performed for influenza A/B, human parainfluenza virus 1–4, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, enterovirus, human coronavirus and human Bocavirus (HBoV). Array cards for atypical bacteria were also used in severe cases.
Results
In total, 188 episodes of ARI were reported, being rhinovirus the most frequently detected (n=53), followed by influenza A(H3) (n=19) and HBoV (n=14). Severe infections were reported in 19 patients, 11 of which were fatal, Legionela pneumophila, rhinovirus, HMPV and RSV associated with these fatalities. Nine influenza strains were analyzed, all antigenically dissimilar from vaccine strain 2013/14. “Age”, “HMPV” and “Respiratory disease” showed an association with severe infection.
Conclusions
In this study an etiologic agent could be found in 60% of the acute respiratory episodes. These data provides information about the circulating viruses in ECC and highlights the importance of searching both viruses and atypical bacteria in severe ARI."

For the identification of bacterial pathogens, blood culture is still the gold standard diagnostic method. However, several disadvantages apply to blood cultures, such as time and rather large volumes of blood sample required. We have previously established an optimised multiplex real-time PCR method in order to diagnose bloodstream infections.
Material and methods
In the present study, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of this optimised multiplex RT-PCR in blood samples collected from 110 septicaemia patients enrolled at the 108 Military Central Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam.
Results
Positive results were obtained by blood culture, the Light Cylcler-based SeptiFast® assay and our multiplex RT-PCR in 35 (32%), 31 (28%), and 31 (28%) samples, respectively. Combined use of the three methods confirmed 50 (45.5%) positive cases of bloodstream infection, a rate significantly higher compared to the exclusive use of one of the three methods (P=0.052, 0.012 and 0.012, respectively). The sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC) of our assay were higher compared to that of the SeptiFast® assay (77.4%, 86.1% and 0.8 vs. 67.7%, 82.3% and 0.73, respectively). Combined use of blood culture and multiplex RT-PCR assay showed a superior diagnostic performance, as the sensitivity, specificity, and AUC reached 83.3%, 100%, and 0.95, respectively. The concordance between blood culture and the multiplex RT-PCR assay was highest for Klebsiella pneumonia (100%), followed by Streptococcus spp. (77.8%), Escherichia coli (66.7%), Staphylococcus spp. (50%) and Salmonella spp. (50%). In addition, the use of the newly established multiplex RT-PCR assay increased the spectrum of identifiable agents (Acintobacter baumannii, 1/32; Proteus mirabilis, 1/32).
Conclusion
The combination of culture and the multiplex RT-PCR assay provided an excellent diagnostic accomplishment and significantly supported the identification of causative pathogens in clinical samples obtained from septic patients."

In June 2015, a local public health laboratory was notified that students had developed gastroenteritis symptoms after attending a camp. An outbreak investigation was conducted to determine the extent and cause of the outbreak.
Method
A retrospective cohort study was conducted to determine the correlations between the illness and specific exposures at the school camp. All attendees were interviewed with a standard questionnaire that addressed clinical symptoms, food consumption, and environmental exposures. Clinical specimens were cultured using standard microbiological methods for bacterial and viral pathogens. The genetic relationships of all isolates were determined using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).
Results
A total 188 patients with symptoms of diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and nausea were identified. The completed questionnaires suggested that the consumption of drinking water was likely to be linked to this outbreak. Using microbiological methods, enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, and enteroaggregative E. coli were isolated, and the isolates from both patient stool and environmental water samples displayed indistinguishable XbaI-PFGE patterns. The water system in the camp used groundwater drawn from a private underground reservoir for cooking and drinking. The environmental investigation revealed some problems with the water supply system, such as the use of inappropriate filters in the water purifier and a defect in the pipeline between the reservoir and the chlorination device.
Conclusions
This outbreak points to the importance of drinking water quality management in group facilities where underground water is used and emphasizes the need for periodic sanitation and inspection to prevent possible waterborne outbreaks."

abstract = "Background
Daptomycin is a bactericidal antibiotic approved for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections and right-side endocarditis. However, there is a lack of published data outlining its usefulness in vascular graft infections (VGI). The aim of this study was to describe the clinical experience of daptomycin use in the treatment of VGI caused by Gram-positive bacteria.
Methods
This was a retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with VGI receiving daptomycin at a tertiary care hospital during the period January 2010 to December 2012.
Results
Of a total 1066 consecutive patients who had undergone vascular grafts (VG), 25 were diagnosed with VGI. Fifteen of these patients (11 prosthetic VG, three autologous VG, one both types) received daptomycin (median dose 6.7mg/kg/day, range 4.1–7.1mg/kg/day; median age 69 years, range 45–83 years; 80% male). The infected bypass was removed in 13 cases. The most common reason for selecting daptomycin was kidney failure (53%). The Gram-positive organisms isolated were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (n=10), Staphylococcus aureus (n=3) (two methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Enterococcus faecium (n=2), and Enterococcus faecalis (n=1). The mean follow-up was 69 months (interquartile range 48–72 months). Ten patients (66.7%) achieved complete healing of the VGI. A recurrence of the infection was observed in 100% of patients in whom the bypass was not removed. Among patients who did not achieve complete healing, one needed a supracondylar amputation and one died as a consequence of infection. Five patients received treatment with rifampicin in addition to daptomycin and they were all cured.
Conclusions
The use of daptomycin and surgery for Gram-positive VGI was effective and well tolerated, and this may be a good alternative for the treatment of VGI in patients with peripheral arterial disease in whom renal insufficiency is common."

Studies have investigated a possible association between family history of HZ and the occurrence of HZ. However, the results were inconclusive and susceptible to bias. We evaluated this association in an elderly population.
Methods
The matched case-control study conducted at Kaiser Permanente Southern California in 2012-2015 included 656 incident HZ patients ≥60 whose skin lesion tested positive for varicella zoster virus by polymerase chain reaction. Half of the HZ patients were vaccinated with zoster vaccine as achieved by stratified sampling. The controls were randomly selected and 1:1 matched to the cases on sex, age (±1year), and zoster vaccination (±3 months of the case’s vaccination date). Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).
Results
Having any blood relative with a history of HZ was associated with a slightly increased risk of HZ (adjusted OR=1.37, 95% CI 1.05–1.79). The adjusted OR associated with having one and two categories of first-degree blood relatives with a history of HZ was 1.30 (95% CI: 0.97–1.73) and 2.53 (95% CI: 1.17–5.44), respectively.

Methods
Individuals with blood cultures growing GCGS in Manitoba, Canada, between January 2012 and December 2015 were included. Clinical and echocardiographic parameters were collected retrospectively. IE was suspected or confirmed according to the modified Duke criteria.
Results
Two hundred and nine bacteremic events occurred in 198 patients. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed in 33%. Suspected or confirmed IE occurred in 6% of all patients and in 18% of those with TTE. Native valve infection was more common than prosthetic valve and device-related infections (75%, 17%, and 8%, respectively). Metastatic infection was observed in 64%, primarily to the lungs (57%), skin (43%), osteoarticular system (29%), and central nervous system (29%). Sepsis occurred in 58% and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome in 50% of those with IE, with overall mortality of 17%.
Conclusions
IE from GCGS bacteremia is common and is frequently associated with severe disease, embolic events, and mortality. In the appropriate clinical context, GCGS bacteremic events should prompt investigation for IE."

MR Staphylococcus was detected in 21% of the rehospitalized patients, as the most common microorganism (p<0.001).
Conclusion
Among rehospitalized patients, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus infections was detected as the most common agent, and Klebsiella spp. infections were found to be significantly associated with fatality."

The primary outcome was to determine whether serum procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy can reduce antibiotic exposure in patients with an acute exacerbation of asthma presenting to the primary care facility or emergency department, or during hospital admission. The secondary outcome was the need for mechanical ventilation.
Methods
An extensive literature search was performed to identify randomized controlled clinical trials (published in English) that compared serum procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy versus antibiotic use according to physician’s discretion for adult participants with mild, moderate, or severe acute asthma exacerbations.
Results
Four randomized controlled trials evaluating 457 patients were included in this meta-analysis, with significant homogeneity observed among these studies. Procalcitonin-based protocols decreased antibiotic prescriptions (relative risk 0.58, 95% confidence interval 0.50–0.67). The conclusion regarding the difference between the two groups in the need for mechanical ventilation (relative risk 1.10, 95% confidence interval 0.62–1.94) was guarded due to inadequate power and the potential for type II error. The overall quality of evidence was also limited by the lack of double-blinding.
Conclusions
These data suggest a potential benefit for the use of serum procalcitonin in guiding antibiotic therapy in patients with an acute asthma exacerbation and advocates the need for more randomized controlled trials."

In this study, we monitored the seroprevalence of HBV-HDV co-infection in different population groups in the Western part of Burkina Faso, and described the genetic diversity of the detected virus strains.
Methods
Between October 2013 and December 2014, venous blood samples were collected from different cohorts (blood donors, pregnant women, outpatients) in the western region of Burkina Faso. Samples were tested for HBsAg and total anti-HDV antibodies. Positive samples were further analysed for HBV-DNA and HDV-RNA. Genotyping of the detected virus strains was done by nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analyses.
Results
A total of 841 participants were included in this study. The mean age was 27.45 years (range: 7–89 years). HBsAg was found in 117 (13.9%) participants. Of the HBsAg positive samples, 4 (3.4%) were positive for total anti-HDV antibodies and negative for HDV RNA. Phylogenetic analyses based on the HBV complete genome (n=10) and S fragment sequences (n=35) showed that all strains belonged to genotype E.
Conclusions
Our study showed a high HBsAg prevalence, but a low rate of HDV co-infection in HBsAg carriers from western Burkina Faso. The predominance of HBV genotype E in the country was confirmed. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the burden of HBV and HDV infection in western Burkina Faso."

The aim of this survey was to describe the current status of HIV care in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and to investigate how close the region is to achieving the UNAIDS 2020 target of 90–90–90.
Methods
In 2014, data were collected from 24 Central and Eastern European countries using a 38-item questionnaire.
Results
All countries reported mandatory screening of blood and organ donors for HIV. Other groups subjected to targeted screening included people who inject drugs (PWID) (15/24, 62.5%), men who have sex with men (MSM) (14/24, 58.3%), and sex workers (12/24, 50.0%). Only 14 of the 24 countries (58.3%) screened pregnant women. The percentages of late presentation and advanced disease were 40.3% (range 14–80%) and 25.4% (range 9–50%), respectively. There was no difference between countries categorized by income or by region in terms of the percentages of persons presenting late or with advanced disease. The availability of newer antiretroviral drugs (rilpivirine, etravirine, darunavir, maraviroc, raltegravir, dolutegravir) tended to be significantly better with a higher country income status. Ten countries reported initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) regardless of CD4+ T cell count (41.7%), five countries (20.8%) used the threshold of <500 cells/μl, and nine countries (37.5%) used the threshold of <350cells/μl. Initiation of ART regardless of the CD4+ T cell count was significantly more common among high-income countries than among upper-middle-income and lower-middle-income countries (100% vs. 27.3% and 0%, respectively; p=0.001). Drugs were provided free of charge in all countries and mostly provided by governments. There were significant discrepancies between countries regarding the follow-up of people living with HIV.
Conclusions
There are major disparities in the provision of HIV care among sub-regions in Europe, which should be addressed. More attention in terms of funding, knowledge and experience sharing, and capacity building is required for the resource-limited settings of Central and Eastern Europe. The exact needs should be defined and services scaled up in order to achieve a standard level of care and provide an adequate and sustainable response to the HIV epidemic in this region."

abstract = "Background
Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is the most geographically widespread tick-borne viral infection. Outbreaks of CCHF in sub-Saharan Africa are largely undetected and thus under-reported. On November 9, 2015, the National Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Laboratory at the Uganda Virus Research Institute received an alert for a suspect VHF case in a 33-year-old male who presented with VHF compatible signs and symptoms at Mengo Hospital in Kampala.
Methods
A blood sample from the suspect patient was tested by RT-PCR for CCHF and found positive. Serological testing on sequential blood specimens collected from this patient showed increasing anti-CCHFV IgM antibody titers, confirming recent infection. Repeat sampling of the confirmed case post recovery showed high titers for anti-CCHFV-specific IgG. An epidemiological outbreak investigation was initiated following the initial RT-PCR positive detection to identify any additional suspect cases.
Results
Only a single acute case of CCHF was detected from this outbreak. No additional acute CCHF cases were identified following field investigations. Environmental investigations collected 53 tick samples, with only 1, a Boophilus decoloratus, having detectable CCHFV RNA by RT-PCR. Full-length genomic sequencing on a viral isolate from the index human case showed the virus to be related to the DRC (Africa 2) lineage.
Conclusions
This is the fourth confirmed CCHF outbreak in Uganda within 2 years after more than 50 years of no reported human CCHF cases in this country. Our investigations reaffirm the endemicity of CCHFV in Uganda, and show that exposure to ticks poses a significant risk for human infection. These findings also reflect the importance of having an established national VHF surveillance system and diagnostic capacity in a developing country like Uganda, in order to identify the first cases of VHF outbreaks and rapidly respond to reduce secondary cases. Additional efforts should focus on implementing effective tick control methods and investigating the circulation of CCHFV throughout the country."

Hyperglycemia occurs in tuberculosis (TB), but the long-term impact is unknown. We estimated the prevalence of hyperglycemia and compared the TB treatment outcomes and 1-year mortality rate according to the glycemic status noted during TB treatment.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of adult patients who had TB and HIV coinfection and started receiving TB treatment at the Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, Brazil, between 2010–2015. Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and hyperglycemia were defined according to the American Diabetes Association. After excluding for known DM at baseline, the proportion of participants who developed new-onset DM after TB treatment was assessed. TB outcome was classified as successful or adverse (i.e., treatment failure, abandonment, and death). Kaplan–Meier survival curves were compared by the log-rank test based on the glycemic status of patients. Multivariate Cox regression models were used to assess the association between hyperglycemia and 1-year mortality. Two-sided p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
We identified 414 euglycemic patients (87.5%), 49 hyperglycemic patients (10.3%), and 10 patients with known DM (2.1%). Diabetic patients were older compared to the euglycemic and hyperglycemic patients (47.9 vs. 37 vs. 39.7 years, respectively, p=0.001). Diabetic patients frequently had cavitation on chest image compared to hyperglycemic and euglycemic patients (50% vs. 23.4% vs. 15.3%, p=0.007, respectively). Hyperglycemic patients had more new-onset DM at follow-up compared to euglycemic (22 vs. 1; p<0001). Hyperglycemia was associated with adverse outcomes (71.4% vs. 24.6%, p<0.0001) compared to euglycemia. Crude 1-year mortality was significantly higher in patients with hyperglycemia compared with euglycemia (48.9% vs. 7.9%; unadjusted HR: 5.79 (3.74–8.96)). In the adjusted Cox models, hyperglycemia remained a significant factor for increased 1-year mortality (adjusted HR: 3.72 (2.17–6.38)].
Conclusions
Hyperglycemia frequently occurs in HIV-infected patients who commence TB treatment, and it increases the risks of adverse TB outcomes and 1-year mortality. Glucose testing during TB treatment detects patients at risk of adverse outcomes."

Hepatitis A is a viral liver disease whose prevalence is associated with low socio-economic and hygiene levels due to its faecal–oral transmission. Severity increases with age, and immunity is life-long. Decreased endemicity could result in increased age and severity of cases. A literature review was conducted to describe changes in age-stratified hepatitis A seroprevalence in Asia Pacific countries from 1980 to 2016, and to identify gaps in the literature. The PRISMA guidelines were followed.
Methods
The PubMed database was searched for studies on age-specific hepatitis A seroprevalence in 17 Asia Pacific countries. All studies published in the English language, reporting human hepatitis A seroprevalence levels in any age group, were included.
Results
Seventy-three publications from 11 countries were identified. A trend of increasing age at first exposure over time was observed, particularly in developed countries such as Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, and Korea, suggesting a transition in terms of endemicity.
Conclusions
Extensive gaps in the literature were identified between countries and year of publication, indicating the need for further research. Decreasing hepatitis A exposure and thus immunity conferred during childhood, may render older populations susceptible to infection. The public health and economic value of vaccination against hepatitis A should be assessed within this changing epidemiological context."

Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a potential biomarker for tumor diagnosis. Hepatocyte damage is a characteristic component of the pathobiology of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which would be expected to result in substantial leakage of cfDNA into the circulation. However, the diagnostic value of cfDNA levels for HCC remains unclear.
Methods
Plasma samples were collected from 24 HCC patients and 62 hepatitis B virus-related liver fibrosis patients. Plasma cfDNA levels were quantified by Qubit method.
Results
Plasma cfDNA levels were associated with the degree of liver inflammation, body mass index, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level, but were not associated with fibrosis stages. Plasma cfDNA levels were significantly higher in HCC patients than in non-HCC patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that age and cfDNA, rather than AFP, were independent predictors of HCC. The HCC index, a combination model including age, cfDNA, and AFP, had an area of 0.98 (95% confidence interval 0.92–1.00) under the receiver operating characteristics curve for the diagnosis of HCC at the cut-off value of 0.61, with 87.0% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The diagnostic power of the HCC index was superior to that of cfDNA alone and AFP alone.
Conclusions
These results suggest that the combination of cfDNA with age and AFP could improve the diagnostic performance for HCC."

Deceased and live-related renal transplants (RTXs) are approved procedures that are performed widely throughout the world. In certain regions, commercial RTX has become popular, driven by financial greed.
Methods
This retrospective, descriptive study was performed at the Royal Hospital from 2013 to 2015. Data were collected from the national kidney transplant registry of Oman. All transplant cases retrieved were divided into two groups: live-related RTX performed in Oman and commercial-unrelated RTX performed abroad. These groups were then divided again into those with and without evidence of fungal infection, either in the wound or renal graft.
Results
A total of 198 RTX patients were identified, of whom 162 (81.8%) had undergone a commercial RTX that was done abroad. Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) were diagnosed in 8% of patients who had undergone a commercial RTX; of these patients, 76.9% underwent a nephrectomy and 23.1% continued with a functioning graft. None of the patients with RTXs performed at the Royal Hospital contracted an IFI. The most common fungal isolates were Aspergillus species (including Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus nidulans, and Aspergillus nigricans), followed by Zygomycetes. However, there was no evidence of fungal infection including Aspergillus outside the graft site. Computed tomography (CT) findings showed infarction of the graft, renal artery thrombosis, aneurysmal dilatation of the external iliac artery, fungal ball, or just the presence of a perigraft collection. Of the total patients with IFIs, 23.1% died due to septic shock and 53.8% were alive and on hemodialysis. The remaining 23.1% who did not undergo nephrectomy demonstrated acceptable graft function.
Conclusions
This is the largest single-center study on commercial RTX reporting the highest number of patients with IFI acquired over a relatively short period of time. Aspergillus spp were the main culprit fungi, with no Candida spp being isolated. A high index of suspicion might be the most reasonable means to reduce the possible very poor outcomes. Improving legal transplant programs and strengthening the associated laws could prevent commercial transplant tourism."

Results
Overall, 75% (57/76) of patients achieved favorable outcomes, including cure (53/76, 70%) and treatment completion (4/76, 5%).

abstract = "Background
Cholera is known to be transmitted from person to person, and inactivated oral cholera vaccines (OCVs) have been shown to confer herd protection via interruption of this transmission. However, the geographic dimensions of chains of person-to-person transmission of cholera are uncertain. The ability of OCVs to confer herd protection was used to define these dimensions in two cholera-endemic settings, one in rural Bangladesh and the other in urban India.
Methods
Two large randomized, placebo-controlled trials of inactivated OCVs, one in rural Matlab, Bangladesh and the other in urban Kolkata, India, were reanalyzed. Vaccine herd protection was evaluated by relating the risk of cholera in placebo recipients to vaccine coverage of surrounding residents residing within concentric rings. In Matlab, concentric rings in 100-m increments up to 700m were evaluated; in Kolkata, 50-m increments up to 350m were evaluated.
Results
One hundred and eight cholera cases among 24667 placebo recipients were detected during 1year of post-vaccination follow-up at Matlab; 128 cholera cases among 34968 placebo recipients were detected during 3 years of follow-up in Kolkata. Consistent inverse relationships were observed between vaccine coverage of the ring and the risk of cholera in the central placebo recipient for rings with radii up to 500m in Matlab and up to 150m in Kolkata.
Conclusions
These results suggest that the dimensions of chains of person-to-person transmission in endemic settings can be quite large and may differ substantially from setting to setting. Using OCVs as ‘probes’ to define these dimensions can inform geographical targeting strategies for the deployment of these vaccines in endemic settings."

Epidemiologic evidence suggests that patients with chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection may be at risk of severe disease complications when they also have comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, cardiac diseases, and/or asthma. However, the prevalence of these co-existing medical conditions in severe CHIKV cases has not been systematically reported.
Objective
The aim of the present study is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to describe the prevalence of chronic comorbidities in CHIKV and evaluate their possible contributions to disease severity.
Methods
A search strategy was developed for online databases. Search terms used were “Chikungunya” AND “Diabetes, Hypertension, Stroke, Cardiovascular Diseases, Coronary Artery Diseases, Obesity, OR Asthma”. Only 11 articles documenting the frequency of comorbidities in CHIKV were included. Meta-analyses were conducted to evaluate the overall prevalence of comorbidities in the CHIKV infection and stratify the estimates by severity.
Results
Among 2,773 CHIKV patients, hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity (31.3%; 95%CI: 17.9-48.8%) followed by diabetes (20.5%; 95%CI: 12.7-31.3%), cardiac diseases (14.8%; 95%CI: 8.1-25.5%) and asthma (7.9%; 95%CI: 3.3-17.7). There was 4- to 5-fold significant increased prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and cardiac diseases in CHIKV patients over 50 years of age compared to their younger counterparts. Severe CHIKV cases had a significantly higher proportion of diabetes than non-severe cases (p<0.05). CHIKV patients with diabetes had OR of 1.2 (95%CI: 1.05-1.48; p=0.0135) for developing severe infection outcome compared to those with no diabetes.
Conclusion
Hypertension, diabetes and cardiac diseases may contribute to the severe outcome of CHIKV. Diabetic subjects may be at higher risk of severe infection. These findings may be relevant in developing public health measures and practices targeting CHIKV patients with comorbidities to avert the severe outcome of the infectious disease."

abstract = "Objectives
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is hyperendemic in many countries, but data on this virus are not available in Jordan. This study determined the seroprevalence, risk factors and zoonotic potential of HEV in a Jordanian population.
Methods
A total of 450 sera samples from 8 different governorates were tested for HEV-IgG. A pre-tested and validated questionnaire was used to collect risk factor data including animal interaction and environmental exposures.
Results
The overall seroprevalence was 30.9%. Eating undercooked meat was significantly associated with HEV seropositivity (OR=2.06, 95%CI 1.04–4.06) after controlling for age, gender, travel history and source of water. Age was also associated with HEV seropositivity; the youngest (≤14 years of age) and oldest age groups (60 and 80 years of age) had the highest prevalence (45.5% and 53.2%, respectively), compared to those between 20 to 29 years of age and 30 to 39 years of age (20.2 and 15.2%, respectively), although the small sample size among the youngest group tempers this association. There was evidence of a marginal association between owning camels and an increased odds of HEV seropositivity. Place of residence and source of drinking water were not associated with infection.
Conclusion
This is the first study to report HEV seroprevalence in Jordan and shows that HEV exposure is high in Jordan. Surveillance for acute and chronic Hepatitis E is needed to estimate the frequency of the actual disease."

abstract = "Objectives
Bacteria with common microbiological and clinical characteristics are often recognized as a particular group. The acronym HACEK stands for five fastidious genera associated with infective endocarditis (Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, and Kingella). Data on the epidemiology of HACEK are sparse. This article reports a 6-year nationwide study of HACEK bacteraemia in Denmark.
Methods
Cases of HACEK bacteraemia occurring during the years 2010–2015 were retrieved from the national Danish microbiology database, covering an average surveillance population of 5.6 million per year.
Results
A total of 147 cases of HACEK bacteraemia were identified, corresponding to an annual incidence of 0.44 per 100000 population. The annual incidence for males was 0.56 per 100000 and for females was 0.31 per 100000. The median age was 56 years (range 0–97 years), with variation among the genera. One hundred and forty-three isolates were identified to the species level and six to the genus level: Haemophilus spp, n=55; Aggregatibacter spp, n=37; Cardiobacterium spp, n=9; Eikenella corrodens n=21; and Kingella spp, n=27.
Conclusions
This is the first study on the incidence of HACEK bacteraemia in a large surveillance population and may inspire further studies on the HACEK group. Haemophilus spp other than Haemophilus influenzae accounted for most cases of HACEK bacteraemia in Denmark, with Aggregatibacter spp in second place."

abstract = "Objective
To investigate the distribution and trends associated with brucellosis incidence rates in Iran from 2011 to 2014.
Methods
The reported incidence rates of brucellosis for the years 2011–2014 were collected and entered into GIS 10.1. The Cochran–Armitage test for linear trends, choropleth maps, hot-spot analysis, and high–low clustering analysis were used to investigate patterns of the disease over the study period and by season, and to identify high-risk areas and any clustering of the disease. The significance level was set at p<0.05.
Results
A total of 68493 cases of brucellosis were reported during the study period, giving an average brucellosis incidence rate for this period of 38.67/100000. In 2011, the highest rate of brucellosis was observed in Koohrang County of Chaharmahal-Bakhtiari Province, with 317/100 000. In the subsequent years, 2012–2014, Charuymaq County of East-Azerbaijan Province had incidence rates of 384, 534, and 583/100000, respectively. However, the incidence rate of the disease did not follow a linear trend (p<0.001). The maximum and minimum incidence rates of the disease occurred in mid-summer and mid-winter, respectively. The results of the hot-spot analysis showed that the distribution of the disease was highest in the mountainous areas of Iran, particularly along the Zagros mountain range and in most cities near the Zagros Mountains (p<0.01). In addition, the cluster analysis showed a clustering pattern in these high incidence areas (p<0.01).
Conclusions
There were significant differences in the geographic distribution of brucellosis, with the incidence rates being highest in most of the cities in the west and north-west of the country. The incidence of this disease also increased during the summer. It is important to take these patterns into account when allocating resources to combat this disease and to ensure that health programs and other interventions focus on the areas of greatest need."

Globally, influenza is a major cause of morbidity, hospitalization and mortality. Influenza vaccination has shown substantial protective effectiveness in the United States.
Methods
We investigated state-level patterns of coverage rates of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccination, among the overall population (six months or older) in the U.S. and specifically among children (aged between 6 months and 17 years) and the elderly (aged 65 years or older), from 2009/10 to 2014/15, and associations with ecological factors. We obtained state-level influenza vaccination rates from national surveys, and state-level socio-demographic and health data from a variety of sources. We employed a retrospective ecological study design, and used both linear models and linear mixed-effect models to determine the levels of ecological association of the state-level vaccinations rates with these factors, both with and without region as a factor for the three populations.
Results and Conclusions
Health-care access has a robust, positive association with state-level vaccination rates across all populations and models. This highlights a potential population-level advantage of expanding health-care access. We also found that prevalence of asthma in adults is negatively associated with mean influenza vaccination rates in the elderly populations."

abstract = "Background
The rapid and accurate identification of individuals who are at high risk of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection remains a major challenge for the medical and scientific communities. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a risk prediction model for the screening of suspected cases of MERS-CoV infection in patients who have developed pneumonia.
Methods
A two-center, retrospective case–control study was performed. A total of 360 patients with confirmed pneumonia who were evaluated for MERS-CoV infection by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) between September 1, 2012 and June 1, 2016 at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh and King Fahad General Hospital in Jeddah, were included. According to the rRT-PCR results, 135 patients were positive for MERS-CoV and 225 were negative. Demographic characteristics, clinical presentations, and radiological and laboratory findings were collected for each subject.
Results
A risk prediction model to identify pneumonia patients at increased risk of MERS-CoV was developed. The model included male sex, contact with a sick patient or camel, diabetes, severe illness, low white blood cell (WBC) count, low alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and high aspartate aminotransferase (AST). The model performed well in predicting MERS-CoV infection (area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUC) 0.8162), on internal validation (AUC 0.8037), and on a goodness-of-fit test (p=0.592). The risk prediction model, which produced an optimal probability cut-off of 0.33, had a sensitivity of 0.716 and specificity of 0.783.
Conclusions
This study provides a simple, practical, and valid algorithm to identify pneumonia patients at increased risk of MERS-CoV infection. This risk prediction model could be useful for the early identification of patients at the highest risk of MERS-CoV infection. Further validation of the prediction model on a large prospective cohort of representative patients with pneumonia is necessary."

keywords = ", Multidrug resistance, Sporadic, Fungal, Colombia",
abstract = "Background
Candida auris is a recently reported Candida species that is phenotypically similar to Candida haemulonii and related to hospital outbreaks. This organism can be misidentified as Candida haemulonii, Candida famata, Candida catenulata, or Rhodotorula glutinis by phenotypic approaches. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and DNA sequence analysis using internal transcribed spacer rDNA bar-coding provide an accurate identification.
Case reports
Three cases of C. auris infection in patients with risk factors for fungal infection (one admitted to the intensive care unit, one with lymphoma, and one with HIV; all three with previous antibiotic use) are reported; these infections were not epidemiologically related. Yeast isolates were recovered from blood, ocular secretion, and bronchoalveolar lavage and were misidentified as C. catenulata and Candida albicans by the phenotypic MicroScan method. The isolates were confirmed to be C. auris by means of MALDI-TOF MS and DNA sequence analysis. Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed on these C. auris isolates, which exhibited high minimum inhibitory concentrations to triazoles and amphotericin B. One patient survived and the other two died. Only one of these deaths was related to fungemia.
Conclusions
C. auris is an emerging and opportunistic multidrug-resistant human pathogen. It is necessary to strengthen measures to achieve an accurate and quick identification and also to avoid its dissemination. This will require improvements in health and infection control measures, as well as the promotion of antifungal stewardship in healthcare facilities."

To conduct a one-year pathogen surveillance of acute diarrheal disease based on outpatient clinics in township hospitals in rural Hongta District of Yunnan Province, China.
Methods
Fecal specimens of acute diarrhea cases and relevant epidemiological information were collected. Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas shigelloides and diarrheogenic Escherichia coli (DEC) were examined.
Results
Among the 797 stool specimens sampled, 198 samples (24.8%) were positive in pathogen isolation, and 223 strains were isolated. The order of isolation rates from high to low were DEC, Aeromonas, P. shigelloides, Salmonella, Shigella and Vibrio. The overall positive rate in middle school students and preschool children was relatively high; while the overall positive rate of less than 1-year-old infants and above 55 years olds was relatively low. The isolates were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Some cases had the same or very close onset time, and the isolates had similar PFGE patterns, suggesting a possible outbreak once occurred but was not detected by the current infectious disease reporting system.

The serological antibody detection tests offer several advantages for the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). The Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antibody responses associated with different stages of TB infection remain to be investigated.
Methods
The Pathozyme-Myco IgG (Myco G), Pathozyme TB Complex Plus (TB Complex), IBL M. tuberculosis IgG ELISA (IBL), Anda Biologicals TB IgG (Anda-TB), and T-SPOT.TB (T-SPOT) tests were performed for 133 active TB patients (ATB group), 131 controls (CON group), and 95 subjects with latent TB infection (LTBI group).
Results
The four serological tests all showed relatively low sensitivity in the ATB group but high specificity in the LTBI and CON groups. The antibody levels of the four serological tests were significantly higher in the ATB group than in the LTBI group. The same trend was observed between the LTBI and CON groups. The four serological tests demonstrated potential diagnostic value in discriminating ATB from LTBI. A combination of the Anda-TB and TB Complex tests exhibited the best diagnostic potential in discriminating ATB from LTBI, with a sensitivity of 89.4% and a specificity of 94.7%. Further, the diagnostic value of Anda-TB and TB Complex were validated in a prospective cohort including 106 patients with suspected ATB. Combined with the T-SPOT test, the tests showed a sensitivity of 87.2% and a specificity of 92.5% for discriminating ATB patients from all ATB suspected cases in the validation group.
Conclusions
The antibody responses of the serological tests all showed significant differences between the ATB and LTBI groups. A combination of Anda-TB and the TB Complex test demonstrated high diagnostic potential in discriminating ATB from LTBI and may be an additional diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection."

abstract = "Introduction
The use of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in outpatient care holds promise as a tool to enhance the quality of care. The management of chronic HIV infection is multidimensional, and clinical assessment includes broad screening to identify complications. With growing constraints on time and resources, the use of PROs may provide a much-needed tool to ensure optimal HIV care. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical implementation and use of a Web-based tool to collect PROs in a cohort of HIV-infected individuals.
Methods
In December 2015, the PRO system AmbuFlex, a Web-based tool for self-reporting of clinical symptoms, was implemented in HIV outpatient care at Aarhus University Hospital. The HIV-specific questionnaire was designed to cover items in the European AIDS Clinical Society guidelines. Patients responded through a Web-based system from home. Based on an HIV-specific algorithm, responses were automatically assigned a green, yellow, or red colour code reflecting the severity of the symptom. HIV-related data from the electronic hospital management system were used to compare respondents and non-respondents. For cognitive and red symptoms, patient records were accessed to address whether PRO provided new information. Furthermore, it was sought to determine whether implementing PROs in clinical care can help focus the consultation on current needs. This was done by checking if a flagged symptom was assessed clinically at the following consultation.
Results
Five hundred and five HIV patients were invited to participate and 277 (55%) accepted the invitation. Compared to respondents, non-respondents were significantly younger and more often female, born outside Denmark, newly diagnosed, and with a plasma viral load >50 copies/ml. Among the 262 correctly received PRO questionnaires, 104 (39%) had solely green colour-coded responses, whereas 59 (23%) had one or more red colour-coded responses. Of 69 red symptoms, 28 (41%) led to a specific clinical assessment. In many cases, PROs appeared to provide new information on cognitive (76%) and red-coded symptoms (42%).
Conclusions
The use of PROs identified several cases where physical or cognitive symptoms appeared to have been unnoticed. A substantial proportion of patients reported no symptoms requiring medical attention, suggesting a potential to individualize outpatient care and redistribute resource utilization."

Methods
The data of 46 patients who were PCR-positive for enteroviruses in the CSF between 2002 and 2017 were evaluated.
Results
Meningitis was the most common clinical manifestation (89%), followed by encephalitis (7%) and isolated cranial nerve involvement (4%). Twenty percent of patients reported a sudden onset of severe headache that led to the initial suspected diagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage. General signs of infection, such as fever, elevated C-reactive protein, and an elevated white blood cell count, were found in only 61%. Most patients exhibited consistent inflammatory CSF changes, with elevated cell counts (85%) and blood–CSF barrier dysfunction (83%). Patients with normal CSF cell counts were significantly older, less frequently presented with meningitis, and exhibited lower peripheral white blood cell counts. Sequencing revealed species Enterovirus B in all patients, with most sequences related to echovirus 30.
Conclusions
The absence of CSF pleocytosis, isolated cranial nerve involvement, and only infrequent general signs of infection may impede the diagnosis of enteroviral nervous system infections. A thorough CSF analysis including PCR is essential for a reliable diagnosis."

The medical records of all adults who met the diagnostic criteria of pulmonary M. lentiflavum disease at Keio University Hospital and Fukujuji Hospital from 2001 to 2015 were reviewed. In addition, the PubMed database was searched to identify further reported cases in non-HIV adults.
Results
Five cases of pulmonary M. lentiflavum disease were identified in the medical records search and 11 additional cases were identified in the literature review. Eleven of the total 16 cases were female, and 15 of 16 cases showed a nodular/bronchiectatic pattern on chest computed tomography imaging. No cases showed an aggressive clinical course of pulmonary M. lentiflavum disease, although one patient died of an exacerbation of underlying vasculitis and bacterial pneumonia.
Conclusions
The clinical characteristics of pulmonary M. lentiflavum disease in adult patients were identified. This disease mainly affects females, displays a nodular/bronchiectatic pattern on chest computed tomography imaging, and does not demonstrate an aggressive clinical course.

The aim of this study was to assess HIV modes of exposure in Morocco at the national level and also for Souss-Massa-Drâa, the region most affected by HIV. Another aim was to assess the impact of different scenarios of select intervention packages.
Methods
The Modes of Transmission Model was adapted and used, and was parameterized using quality bio-behavioral surveillance data among key populations, routine data sources, and literature reviews.
Results
Nationally in 2013, the largest number of new infections occurred among clients of female sex workers (FSWs) (25%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 14–37%), followed by men who have sex with men (MSM) (22%; 95% CI 12–35%), HIV serodiscordant couples (22%; 95% CI 12–34%), FSWs (11%; 95% CI 6–18%), and people who inject drugs (5%; 95% CI 2–9%). A similar pattern of results was observed in Souss-Massa-Drâa, but the HIV incidence rate was four-fold that at the national level. Different scenarios of feasible intervention packages reduced HIV incidence by 8–44%.
Conclusions
Commercial heterosexual sex networks continue as the leading driver of the epidemic, with half of HIV incidence. A quarter of new infections occurred among MSM, a third of which in Souss-Massa-Drâa. Feasible expanded coverage of interventions could lead to large reductions in incidence."

The M. pneumoniae genotype was determined by PCR and sequencing of the p1 and 23S rRNA genes from induced sputum samples and nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS). Samples were obtained from children with CAP who were hospitalized in 13 healthcare centers. In addition, a spatio-temporal analysis was performed to identify the potential risk areas and clustering of the cases over time.
Results
A variant of type 2 was the dominant genotype in the induced sputum (96.1%) and NPS (89.3%) samples; the type 1 variant was identified in 3.9% and 10.7% of these samples, respectively. No strains with mutations in the 23S rRNA gene associated with macrolide resistance were found. The cases in Medellín were mainly concentrated in the northeastern areas and western districts. However, no temporal relationship was found among these cases.

abstract = "Background
Ensuring patients fully adhere to their treatment is a major challenge for TB control programmes in resource-limited settings. This study was conducted three outpatient tuberculosis clinics in Hanoi, Vietnam. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of using asynchronous Video Directly Observed Therapy (VDOT) to support treatment adherence among patients with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis.
Methods
In this cohort study, consecutive adult patients with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB were invited to enroll in a programme of VDOT. Patients were trained to use a smartphone to record themselves taking treatment for TB. Videos were uploaded to an online server and reviewed daily by study staff for at least two months. Adherence was evaluated based upon monthly pill count.
Results
Between November 2016 and January 2017, 40 of 78 eligible participants (51.3%) agreed to commence VDOT. Among participating patients, 27 (71.1%) of patients took all required doses. A median of 88.4% (interquartile range 75.8%-93.7%) of doses were correctly recorded and uploaded. Participants rated the VDOT interface highly, despite facing some initial technical difficulties.
Conclusion
VDOT was feasible and resulted in high rates of treatment adherence in a resource-limited setting."

abstract = "Objectives
Varicella vaccine (VarV) is recommended as effective post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) within 3–5days to control outbreaks. However, the effectiveness of PEP at >5days after exposure and the administration of a second dose to those with a history of one dose prior to exposure have not been fully examined. This study evaluated the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of PEP in preventing disease during a varicella outbreak in Shanghai, China in 2013.
Methods
Self-administered questionnaires were used to obtain the students’ varicella history, vaccination status, and willingness to receive PEP. One dose of VarV was provided free of charge to eligible students. The VE of PEP was calculated as [1−relative risk (RR)]×100%. Analyses were restricted to grade 8 students, as no students from the other grades or teachers developed varicella during the outbreak.
Results
Twenty-seven varicella cases were identified, 16 (59%) of which were infected after the PEP campaign. Sixty-five students received one dose of VarV on day 13 or 19 after the index case. Attack rates were 28% (9/32), 16% (15/94), 0% (0/10), and 6% (3/55) among unvaccinated, one-dose Pre-PEP, first dose as PEP, and second dose as PEP recipients, respectively. Cases among second dose as PEP recipients tended to have less fever compared with unvaccinated or one-dose Pre-PEP recipients. Compared with unvaccinated students, the VE of first dose as PEP recipients was 100% and of the second dose as PEP recipients was 60% (95% confidence interval −72% to 91%).
Conclusions
Post-exposure vaccination should be given as soon as possible after exposure. Nevertheless, vaccination is still recommended even at more than 5days post-exposure to control varicella outbreaks."

Trypanosoma cruzi reactivation in HIV patients is considered an opportunistic infection, usually with a fatal outcome. The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological and clinical features of T. cruzi infection in HIV patients and to compare these findings between patients with and without Chagas disease reactivation.
Methods
The medical records of T. cruzi–HIV co-infected patients treated at the Muñiz Infectious Diseases Hospital from January 2005 to December 2014 were reviewed retrospectively. Epidemiological and clinical features were assessed and compared between patients with and without Chagas disease reactivation.
Results
The medical records of 80 T. cruzi–HIV co-infected patients were reviewed. The most likely route of T. cruzi infection was vector-borne (32/80 patients), followed by intravenous drug use (12/80). Nine of 80 patients had reactivation. Patients without reactivation had a significantly higher CD4 T-cell count at diagnosis of T. cruzi infection (144 cells/μl vs. 30 cells/μl, p=0.026). Chagas disease serology was negative in two of nine patients with reactivation.
Conclusions
Serological assays for T. cruzi infection may be negative in severely immunocompromised patients. Direct parasitological techniques should be performed in the diagnosis of patients for whom there is a suspicion of T. cruzi reactivation. HIV patients with a lower CD4 count are at higher risk of reactivation."

Orientia tsutsugamushi is an obligate intracellular pathogen that causes scrub typhus. Diagnosing scrub typhus remains a challenge, and a sensitive, specific, simple, and rapid diagnostic test is still needed.
Methods
A recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay combined with a lateral flow (LF) test targeting the 56-kDa gene of a Karp-like strain of O. tsutsugamushi was developed and optimized. The detection limits, sensitivity, specificity, and simulative clinical performance were evaluated.
Results
Primers and probe were screened to establish the RPA assay, and the reaction conditions were optimized. The detection limit was 10 copies/reaction in detecting plasmid DNA and 12 copies/reaction in detecting genomic DNA. The RPA–LF method could differentiate O. tsutsugamushi from other phylogenetically related bacteria. The sensitivity was 100% and specificity was over 90%, when evaluated using infected animal samples or simulative clinical samples. Furthermore, the method was completed in 20min at 37°C followed by a 3–5min incubation at room temperature for the development of an immunochromatographic strip, and the results could be determined visually.
Conclusions
This method is promising for wide-ranging use in basic medical units considering that it requires minimal instruments and infrastructure and is highly time-efficient, sensitive, and specific for diagnosing scrub typhus."

abstract = "Background
In low- and middle-income countries, including South Africa, the epidemiology of pertussis in relation to immunization, nutritional, and HIV status is poorly described. This article reports on risk factors in South African children hospitalized with pertussis.
Methods
A prospective, hospital-based, sentinel surveillance programme for pertussis was conducted in Gauteng Province, South Africa. Hospitalized children (≤10 years) meeting the surveillance criteria for clinically suspected pertussis were screened and enrolled. Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected for real-time multiplex PCR and culture of Bordetella species.
Results
Bordetella pertussis was detected in 6.2% (61/992) of children. Pertussis was significantly more prevalent in infants younger than 3 months (9.8%; 38/392) and in young children between the ages of 5 and 9 years (12%; 4/34) (p=0.0013). Of the 61 confirmed pertussis cases, 17 were too young for vaccination. Of the remaining 44 infants, vaccination DTP1 was administered in 73% (32/44) of pertussis-confirmed patients who were eligible, DTP2 in 50% (16/32), DTP3 in 54% (14/26), and DTP4 in 56% (5/9) of vaccine-eligible cases at 18 months of age. B. pertussis infection was less likely in children immunized at least once (5%, 32/692) than in unvaccinated children (10%, 24/230) (p=0.0001). HIV exposure and infection status were determined in 978 (99%) patients: 69% (678/978) were HIV-unexposed and uninfected and 31% (300/978) were HIV-exposed. Of these HIV-exposed patients, 218 (22%) were proven HIV-exposed and uninfected and 82 patients were HIV-infected (8.4%, 82/978). HIV prevalence was similar in pertussis-positive (6%, 5/82) and pertussis-negative (6%, 55/896) children (p=0.90). B. pertussis infection was unrelated to poor nutritional status.
Conclusions
In South Africa, B. pertussis poses a greater risk to infants who are too young for the first vaccine dose, those who are not vaccinated in a timely manner, and those who do not receive all three primary doses. HIV infection and HIV exposure were not associated with pertussis infection."

Childhood vaccination in Bangladesh has improved, but there is room for improvement. This study estimated full immunization coverage in Bangladeshi children and characterized risk factors for incomplete immunization.
Methods
Using the 2014 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), full vaccination of children aged 12 to 24 months was examined; this was defined as the receipt of one dose of bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG), three doses of pentavalent vaccine, three doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV), and one dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV). Associations between full vaccination and selected risk factors were assessed by logistic regression.
Results
Overall, 83% of children were fully vaccinated. BCG had the highest completion (97%), followed by OPV (92%), pentavalent vaccine (91%), and MCV (85%). Full vaccination coverage ranged from 64.4% in Sylhet to 90.0% in Rangpur and was lowest among non-locals of all regions (78.4%). Children who were in the lowest wealth quintile, who had mothers without antenatal care visits, or who had mothers without autonomy in healthcare decision-making were less likely to be fully vaccinated.
Conclusions
Overall, full vaccination of children is high, but varies by vaccine type. Disparities still exist by wealth and by region. Maternal access to care and autonomy in healthcare decision-making are associated with higher vaccination coverage."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of empirical vancomycin for patients with neutropenic fever (NF) with regard to adherence to treatment guidelines.
Methods
Adult patients with a diagnosis of neutropenia, who met the definition of NF as per treatment guidelines, were identified. Use of vancomycin was evaluated as part of empirical therapy and again after 72h. Outcomes were assessed using descriptive statistics, the Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test, and univariate exact logistic regression analyses.
Results
Sixty-four patients were included. Overall, inappropriate empirical vancomycin use was observed in more than 30% of patients. Of 35 patients with indications for empirical vancomycin, only 68% received it. At 72h, appropriate vancomycin continuation, de-escalation, or discontinuation occurred in 21 of 33 patients. On univariate regression, hematological malignancy was associated with appropriate empirical vancomycin prescribing, whether initiating or withholding (odds ratio 4.0, 95% confidence interval 1.31–12.1). No variable was independently associated with inappropriate continuation at 72h.
Conclusions
There is poor guideline adherence to vancomycin prescribing as empirical therapy and at 72-h reassessment in patients with NF. Further efforts are needed to foster a more rational use of vancomycin in patients with NF."

abstract = "Objectives
The objective of this study was to map the global risk of the major arboviral diseases transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus by identifying areas where the diseases are reported, either through active transmission or travel-related outbreaks, as well as areas where the diseases are not currently reported but are nonetheless suitable for the vector.
Methods
Data relating to five arboviral diseases (Zika, dengue fever, chikungunya, yellow fever, and Rift Valley fever (RVF)) were extracted from some of the largest contemporary databases and paired with data on the known distribution of their vectors, A. aegypti and A. albopictus. The disease occurrence data for the selected diseases were compiled from literature dating as far back as 1952 to as recent as 2017. The resulting datasets were aggregated at the country level, except in the case of the USA, where state-level data were used. Spatial analysis was used to process the data and to develop risk maps.
Results
Out of the 250 countries/territories considered, 215 (86%) are potentially suitable for the survival and establishment of A. aegypti and/or A. albopictus. A. albopictus has suitability foci in 197 countries/territories, while there are 188 that are suitable for A. aegypti. There is considerable variation in the suitability range among countries/territories, but many of the tropical regions of the world provide high suitability over extensive areas. Globally, 146 (58.4%) countries/territories reported at least one arboviral disease, while 123 (49.2%) reported more than one of the above diseases. The overall numbers of countries/territories reporting autochthonous vector-borne occurrences of Zika, dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, and RVF, were 85, 111, 106, 43, and 39, respectively.
Conclusions
With 215 countries/territories potentially suitable for the most important arboviral disease vectors and more than half of these reporting cases, arboviral diseases are indeed a global public health threat. The increasing proportion of reports that include multiple arboviral diseases highlights the expanding range of their common transmission vectors. The shared features of these arboviral diseases should motivate efforts to combine interventions against these diseases."

To analyze the serotype distribution of Streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates collected in the south of Tunisia over a 5-year period in different age groups and to assess their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns.
Methods
A total of 305 non-duplicate S. pneumoniae isolates were collected between January 2012 and December 2016 at the university hospital in Sfax, Tunisia. All isolates were serotyped by multiplex PCR. The antibiotic susceptibility of all isolates was determined using the disk diffusion test or Etest assay.
Results
Among the 305 pneumococcal isolates, 76 (24.9%) were invasive and 229 (75.1%) were non-invasive. The most common serotypes were 19F (20%), 14 (16.7%), 3 (9.2%), 23F (7.5%), 19A (5.9%), and 6B (5.9%). Potential immunization coverage rates for pneumococcal conjugate vaccines PCV7, PCV10, and PCV13 were 58%, 59.3%, and 78.7%, respectively. Three-quarters (75.3%) of pneumococcal isolates were non-susceptible to penicillin. The resistance rate to erythromycin was 71.4%. Only two isolates were resistant to levofloxacin.
Conclusions
19F and 14 were the most prevalent serotypes in the south of Tunisia. The inclusion of a PCV in the immunization program could be useful for reducing the burden of pneumococcal diseases. The high resistance rate to penicillin and macrolides is alarming. Prudent use of antibiotics is crucial to prevent the selection of multidrug-resistant pneumococci."

Design
Cross-sectional analysis of project records, township TB registers and annual TB reports.
Results
In the household and neigbourhood intervention, of 56,709 people screened, 1,076 were presumptive TB and 74 patients were treated for active TB with a screening yield of 0.1% and a yield from presumptive cases of 6.9%. In the community intervention, of 162,881 people screened, 4,497 were presumptive TB and 984 were treated for active TB with a screening yield of 0.6% and yield from presumptive cases of 21.9%. Of active TB cases, 94% were new, 89% were pulmonary, 44% were bacteriologically-confirmed and 5% had HIV. Case notification rates per 100,000 in project townships increased from 142 during baseline (2011-2013) to 148 during intervention (2014-2016) periods.
Conclusions
The yield from household and neigbourhood intervention was lower than community intervention. This finding highlights reconsidering the strategy of screening of contacts from historical index cases.

The numbers of articles reporting randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on viral hepatitis in China have been increasing, but there have been few systematic studies evaluating the reporting quality of RCTs in this field. This study was performed to assess the reporting quality of RCTs on the treatment of hepatitis B and C in China from 1991 to 2015.
Methods
Articles published between January 1991 and December 2015 were identified via the PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase databases using the key words “randomized clinical trials”, “treatment”, “therapy”, “hepatitis B”, “HBV”, “hepatitis C”, “HCV”, “China”, and “Chinese”. The reporting quality was assessed against the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist.
Results
In total, 211 RCTs on the treatment of hepatitis B or C were included. The number of articles focusing on these RCTs increased rapidly over time, while the reporting quality improved steadily over time. Overall, compliance with the key components of the CONSORT checklist was low, with only 8.5%, 3.8%, and 11.4% of the articles fulfilling the reporting requirements of randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding, respectively.
Conclusions
Both the number and the quality of RCT articles were found to have increased steadily over the last two decades. However, compliance with the key components of the CONSORT checklist still needs improvement. It is hoped that the results of this study will lead to improvements in the reporting quality of clinical trials on hepatitis B and C in China."

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by disk diffusion on agar technique and the results were read automatically using an OSIRIS system. The Etest was used to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for some resistance phenotypes. The strain most commonly identified was Escherichia coli (63.9%). The proportion of ESBL-E increased gradually over the study period, from 23.8% to 38.4%. ESBL was detected in 42.7% of the E. coli strains and 33.7% of all Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated. The proportion of ESBL-producing E. coli increased significantly from 28.9% in 2012 to 48.2% in 2015, while the increase for K. pneumoniae remained non-significant. Multidrug resistance was high in this Cambodian series, with some strains displaying resistance to all antibiotics available in the country. There is currently no established system for the surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in Cambodia.

abstract = "Background
New tuberculosis (TB) drug treatment regimens are urgently needed. This study evaluated the potential of the histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs) valproic acid (VPA) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) to enhance the effects of first-line anti-TB drugs against intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Methods
M. tuberculosis H37Rv cultures were exposed to VPA or SAHA over 6 days, in the presence or absence of isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF). The efficacy of VPA and SAHA against intracellular M. tuberculosis with and without INH or RIF was tested by treating infected macrophages. Bactericidal activity was assessed by counting mycobacterial colony-forming units (CFU).
Results
VPA treatment exhibited superior bactericidal activity to SAHA (2-log CFU reduction), while both HDIs moderately improved the activity of RIF against extracellular M. tuberculosis. The bactericidal effect of VPA against intracellular M. tuberculosis was greater than that of SAHA (1-log CFU reduction) and equalled that of INH (1.5-log CFU reduction). INH/RIF and VPA/SAHA combination treatment inhibited intracellular M. tuberculosis survival in a shorter time span than monotherapy (3days vs. 6 days).
Conclusions
VPA and SAHA have adjunctive potential to World Health Organization-recommended TB treatment regimens. Clinical evaluation of the two drugs with regard to reducing the treatment duration and improving treatment outcomes in TB is warranted."

abstract = "Objective
To evaluate the diagnostic performance of TB-LAMP, a manual molecular tuberculosis (TB) detection method, and provide comparison to the Xpert MTB/RIF assay.
Methods
In a large multicentre study, two sputum samples were collected from participants with TB symptoms in reference laboratories in Peru, South Africa, Brazil, and Vietnam. Each sample was tested with TB-LAMP. The reference standard consisted of four direct smears, four cultures, and clinical and radiological findings. Individuals negative on conventional tests were followed up after 8 weeks. The Xpert MTB/RIF assay was performed on fresh or frozen samples as a molecular test comparison.
Results
A total of 1036 adults with suspected TB were enrolled. Among 375 culture-confirmed TB cases with 750 sputum samples, TB-LAMP detected 75.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 71.8–79.4%), including 97.9% (95% CI 96.4–99.4%) of smear-positive TB samples and 46.6% (95% CI 40.6–52.7%) of smear-negative TB samples. Specificity in 477 culture-negative participants not treated for TB (954 sputum samples) was 98.7% (95% CI 97.9–99.6%). TB-LAMP test results were indeterminate in 0.3% of cases.
Conclusions
TB-LAMP detects nearly all smear-positive and half of smear-negative TB cases and has a high specificity when performed in reference laboratories. Performance was similar to the Xpert MTB/RIF assay."

Better methods are needed for the accurate detection of child tuberculosis (TB). This study compared different laboratory tests and evaluated IS6110 PCR for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) among clinically diagnosed child TB patients.
Methods
A total of 102 paediatric patients (<15 years old) with clinically diagnosed TB were enrolled in this study. The patients were admitted to the icddr,b hospital in Dhaka between 2003 and 2005. Sputum/gastric lavage samples were collected for smear microscopy, culture (solid/Lowenstein–Jensen medium and liquid/MGIT), and IS6110 PCR testing. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) of smear microscopy and PCR were compared to the two culture methods.
Results
Three patients were positive on smear microscopy (2.9%). MTB was detected by conventional culture in 15.7% (16/102), liquid culture in 14% (14/100), and IS6110 PCR in 61.8% (63/102). PCR detected an additional 45 patients who were undetected with the three other tests. Compared to conventional and liquid culture, respectively, smear microscopy showed sensitivity of 18.8% and 21.4%, specificity of 100% individually, PPV of 100% individually, and NPV of 86.9% and 88.7%, whereas PCR had sensitivity of 87.5% and 92.9%, specificity of 43% individually, PPV of 22.2% and 21%, and NPV of 94.9% and 97.4%.
Conclusions
PCR can be useful compared to smear microscopy and culture methods and is applicable as a rapid screening test for child TB. A larger scale study is required to determine its diagnostic efficacy in improving the detection of child TB in the presence and absence of severe malnutrition."

The methods combining culture and quantitative PCR(qPCR) offer new solutions for rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing(AST). However, the multiple steps of DNA extraction and cold storage of PCR reagents needed make them unsuitable for rapid high throughput AST. In this study, a parallel culture-qPCR method was developed to overcome above problems.
Method
In this method, bacteria culture and DNA extraction automatically and simultaneously completed through using a common PCR instrument as a controllable heating device. A lyophilized 16S rDNA targeted qPCR reagent was also developed, which was stable and could be kept at 4°C for long time and at 37°C for about two months.
Result
Testing of 36 P. aeruginosa isolates and 28 S. aureus isolates showed that the method had good agreements with the standard broth microdilution method, with an overall agreement of 97.22% (95% CI, 85.83–99.51) for P. aeruginosa and 96.43% (95% CI, 79.76–99.81) for S. aureus. This method could test 12 samples against a panel of up to 7 antibiotics simultaneously in two 96-well PCR plates within 4h, which greatly improves the testing efficiency of the culture-qPCR method.

At present, data are limited on the comorbidity profiles associated with aging people with HIV in the developing world, where most such people live. The aim of this study was to compare the disease burden between older HIV-positive subjects and HIV-negative matched controls in Brazil.
Methods
This was a cross-sectional analysis of the South Brazilian HIV Cohort. Individuals aged 50 years and older were enrolled at Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre and matched with HIV-negative controls from the primary practice unit of the same hospital. Multimorbidity (the presence of two or more comorbid conditions) and the number of non-infectious comorbidities were compared. Poisson regression was used to identify factors associated with multimorbidity.
Results
A total of 208 HIV-positive subjects were matched to 208 HIV-negative controls. Overall, the median age was 57 years and 56% were male. The prevalence of multimorbidity was higher in HIV-positive subjects than in HIV-negative controls (63% vs. 43%, p<0.001), and the median number of comorbidities was 2, compared to 1 in controls (p<0.001). The duration of HIV infection (p=0.02) and time on treatment in years (p=0.015) were associated with greater multimorbidity in HIV-positive persons.
Conclusions
In this large cohort from the developing world, multimorbidity was found to be more common in HIV-positive subjects than in HIV-negative controls. The duration of HIV and time on antiretrovirals were associated with multimorbidity."

Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease with high mortality. T cell deficiency has recently been described, but the changes in T cell functionality during acute SFTS virus (SFTSV) infection and the mechanisms leading to T lymphocyte death remain largely unknown. This study was conducted to evaluate T cell functionality and the expression of apoptotic/proliferation and activation/inhibition markers during acute SFTSV infection.
Methods
Twenty-eight surviving SFTS patients were sequentially sampled during their entire hospital stay. SFTSV RNA copies were investigated using real-time RT-PCR. The expression levels of apoptotic markers (annexin V and CD95) and proliferation and activation markers (Ki-67, HLA-DR, and CD25) and the expression levels of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), and granzyme B in T cells were evaluated by flow cytometry for the SFTS patients.
Results
In parallel with T cell depletion, higher annexin V and CD95 expression was observed in SFTS patients. Additionally, the expression levels of Ki-67, HLA-DR, CD25, and PD-1 and the levels of IFN-γ and granzyme B in T lymphocytes were markedly increased in the SFTS patients.
Conclusions
T cell proliferation, activation, and functional enhancement were apparent despite the observation of T cell apoptosis, suggesting that these processes are involved in the complex protective response to SFTSV infection."

The population structure of human diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) isolates derived from worldwide collections remains undefined.
Methods
A total of 1196 clinical isolates were obtained from a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) database. Genetic diversity analysis, MLST analysis, and phylogenetic analysis combined with different pathotypes were performed through a variety of calculation software applications.
Results
All isolates were categorized as one of 579 different sequence types (STs). The eBURST algorithm resolved these 579 STs into 27 clonal complexes (CCs), 37 concatemers, and 210 singletons, revealing a high level of genetic diversity in the population structure of DEC. CC10 was the most prevalent CC, comprising 276 (23.08%, 276/1196) isolates with 85 (14.68%, 85/579) STs widely distributed in 20 countries. The population structure of five common pathotypes was highly diversified, and isolates with the same ST or CC were heterogeneous for different pathotypes. Sequence variations were more abundant in fumC and gyrB than in the other five genes, and these exhibited the highest degree of nucleotide diversity (0.03886 and 0.03075, respectively) and the greatest number of polymorphic nucleotide sites (137 and 139, respectively). The dN/dS ratios of seven analyzed loci varied from 0.0083 (recA) to 0.0434 (purA), and the ratio for the concatenated sequence was 0.2518, revealing the effects of purifying selection on housekeeping genes during the evolutionary process. Significant allele linkage disequilibrium was detected when the standardized index of association (ISA) was calculated both for the entire collection of isolates (0.3174, p<0.001) and for the 579 STs (0.1475, p<0.001).
Conclusions
This study facilitated a comprehensive understanding of the genetic diversity of human DEC distributed across the global population. The results provide genetic evidence that will allow us to uncover the microevolutionary relationships among different pathogenic isolates of DEC."

The early identification of patients at risk of complications of infective endocarditis (IE) using parameters obtained as part of routine practice is essential for guiding clinical decision-making. This study aimed to identify a parameter at hospital admission that predicts the outcome, adding value to other well-known factors of a poor prognosis in IE.
Methods
Two hundred and three patients with IE were included in this study. Clinical evaluation, echocardiography, blood cultures, and routine laboratory tests were performed at hospital admission. The endpoint was in-hospital mortality.
Results
The mean age of the patients was 48.2±16.6 years; 62% were male and 38% had rheumatic heart disease. During treatment, cardiac surgery was performed in 111 patients (55%), and the overall in-hospital mortality rate was 32%. In the multivariable analysis, the independent predictors of death were age (odds ratio (OR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02–1.13), C-reactive protein (CRP) at hospital admission (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.04–1.21), length of the vegetation at diagnosis (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.03–1.28), development of heart failure (OR 6.43, 95% CI 2.14–19.33), and embolic events during antimicrobial therapy (OR 12.14, 95% CI 2.11–71.89).

Blood samples from 201 HIV-1-infected and 115 HTLV-1-infected individuals were examined and compared with those from 300 healthy controls. Genotyping of A1AT (S and Z) and quantification of plasma viral load were performed using RT-PCR, and the CD4+/CD8+ T-cell count was determined by flow cytometry.
Results
The wild-type MM genotype showed the highest frequency in each of the three groups investigated. SS and ZZ homozygous genotypes (variants) were observed only among HTLV-1 patients and controls, respectively. Genotype MS was significantly less frequent in HTLV-1-positive persons than in controls. Statistically significant differences were observed when comparing genotype frequencies between symptomatic and asymptomatic HTLV-1-infected persons. The distribution of plasma HIV-1 viral load among individuals with different genotypes of A1AT polymorphism also differed significantly.

Intense migrations from tuberculosis endemic areas to Gulf countries create special risks for people in the region. The purpose of this study was to provide data that could justify implementing universal, regular TB screening in UAE.
Design
This prospective, cross-sectional study used interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) to screen for TB among Emirati citizens between August-2016 and May-2017; expatriates were not included in this study. Participants were recruited from Emiratis attending Tawam Hospital Polyclinics for problems unrelated to TB risk assessment. IGRA was requested for all enrolled participants. A risk-assessment questionnaire was completed by all participants. In addition, a retrospective review of IGRA results (January-2011 to April-2016) was conducted to compare prevalence of positive IGRA in the ‘prospective sample’ with that in ‘patients screened in the past’.
Results
Four hundred fifty-five participants (69% females) were enrolled in this study. Participants’ age (mean±SD) was 42±16y. The majority of participants had traveled to or had helpers from TB-endemic areas. Two hundred forty (53%) participants had IGRA test. Forty-five (18.8%) participants had positive IGRA, similar to the retrospective results of 12.4% to 23.5%.

This observational study recorded the malaria and sickle cell disease (SCD) profile of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) and determined whether prophylactic co-trimoxazole (CTX) and the haemoglobin S (Hb S) allele influenced malaria episodes.
Methods
Sickling status, malaria episodes, and HIV type, as well as other data, were extracted retrospectively from the clinical records of 1001 patients attending the antiretroviral therapy clinic at Ridge Regional Hospital in Accra, Ghana between 2010 and 2015. Finger-prick capillary blood of returning patients (n=501) was tested for the haemoglobin (Hb) level and malaria, after information on malaria prevention methods was obtained through the administration of a questionnaire.
Results
The use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets was low (22.8%). CTX prophylaxis showed no significant influence on the overall number of malaria episodes from 2010 to 2015; however, it did show a statistically significant relationship (p=0.026) with the time elapsed since the last malaria episode. Even though 19% of participants possessed Hb S, it had no influence on malaria episodes.
Conclusions
Hb S did not influence malaria in PLHA. Further studies in Hb SS and Hb SC are needed, as there are suggestions of increased frequency and severity of malaria. The impact of CTX prophylaxis on this cohort will be insightful."

abstract = "Background
The aim of this study was to determine the concentration of HMGB-1 (high mobility group box 1) in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients suffering from tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and neuroborreliosis (NB). Focus was placed on HMGB-1 measurement in the CSF or serum in order to establish whether this could help to differentiate between NB and TBE.
Methods
Eighty patients with meningitis and meningoencephalitis were enrolled in the study. The patients were divided into two groups: group I comprised patients with NB (n=40) and group II comprised patients with TBE (n=40). The diagnosis was made based on the clinical picture, CSF examination, and the presence of specific antibodies in the serum and CSF. The control group for the evaluation of the parameters in serum were healthy blood donors (n=25), while the control group for the evaluation of parameters in the CSF were patients in whom a central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory process was excluded. The concentrations of HMGB-1 were measured by ELISA method using a commercial kit (HMGB-1 ELISA Kit; EIAab, China). The results were analyzed using Statistica 10, Gretl, receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC), and the Pearson correlation coefficient.
Results and conclusions
HMGB-1 is associated with the development of inflammatory processes in the CNS caused by both tick-borne pathogens: viral (TBE) and bacterial (Lyme borreliosis). Measurement of the serum HMGB-1 concentration in the early stages of both diseases of the CNS may contribute to the differentiation between TBE and NB, which may have a clinical impact for patients bitten by ticks."

HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) are frequently occurring comorbidities in HIV-positive patients, diagnosed by means of a neuropsychological assessment (NPA). Due to the magnitude of the HIV-positive population in Sub-Saharan Africa, easy-to-use cognitive screening tools are essential.
Methods
This was a cross-sectional clinical trial involving 44 HIV-positive patients (on stable cART) and 73 HIV-negative controls completing an NPA, the International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS), and a culturally appropriate cognitive screening tool, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment–Basic (MoCA-B). HAND were diagnosed by calculating Z-scores using internationally published normative data on NPA, as well as by using data from the HIV-negative group to validate the MoCA-B.
Results
One hundred and seventeen patients were included (25% male, median age 35 years, median 11 years of education). A moderate correlation was found between the MoCA-B and NPA total Z-score (Pearson’s r=0.36, p=0.02). Area under the curve (AUC) values for MoCA-B and IHDS were 0.59 and 0.70, respectively. The prevalence of HAND in HIV-positive patients was 66% when calculating Z-scores using published normative data versus 48% when using the data from the present HIV-negative cohort.
Conclusion
The MoCA-B appeared not to be a valid screening tool for HAND in this setting. The prevalence of HAND in this setting is high, but appeared overestimated when using published norms."

To evaluate the outcomes of anti-tuberculosis drug desensitization.
Methods
This was a retrospective study. Inclusion criteria were as follows: age >18years, documented tuberculosis infection, a previous cutaneous allergic reaction to anti-tuberculosis drugs, and having undergone drug desensitization between January 2003 and March 2014. The definition of allergic reaction to anti-tuberculosis drugs included (1) a temporal relationship between drug use and the allergic reaction; (2) improvement in the allergic reaction after drug withdrawal; (3) recurrence of the allergic reaction after reintroduction of only the offending drug; and (4) absence of other causes.
Results
A total of 19 desensitization procedures were performed. The drugs used for these procedures were isoniazid (n=7), rifampicin (n=6), or ethambutol (n=6). Of note, severe allergic reactions (Stevens–Johnson syndrome (n=4), erythema multiforme (n=3), and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic syndrome (n=1)) were included. All patients underwent resolution of the previous allergic reactions before desensitization. The median duration of desensitization was 18 days. The success rate was 78.9%. The allergic reactions following failed desensitization were not severe; most were maculopapular rashes.
Conclusions
The desensitization protocol for anti-tuberculosis drugs was associated with a high success rate, and the individuals who failed desensitization experienced mild allergic reactions."

Between February 2012 and May 2016, six residents of an 11-storey apartment block were diagnosed with MDR-TB. Based on initial tests, all isolates had similar genotypic profiles, although there were no identifiable epidemiological transmission patterns between three cases. We present findings from the cluster investigation and results of a mass screening exercise.
Design
Free voluntary TB screening was offered to past and current residents of the apartment block, comprising an interview, Chest X-Ray, and Interferon Gamma Release Assay or Tuberculin skin test. Expected latent TB proportions were calculated using a reference population, and whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed.
Results
The index case was involved in a separate gaming centre outbreak involving five patrons. 241 current (67.9% of 355 residents) and 18 past residents were screened. The latent TB proportion was 19.9%, which was at the higher end of the expected range. WGS confirmed relatedness of cases’ MDR-TB isolates– eight of 10 isolates were genetically identical, while the remaining two were one Single Nucleotide Polymorphism apart.
Conclusion
With WGS, TB clusters not apparent through regular activity-based contact tracing may be detected. Mass screening may help inform the extent of transmission, but is limited by participation and difficulties in interpretation."

The objective of this review was to assess the burden of HIV drug resistance mutations (DRM) in Indian adults exposed to first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) as per national guidelines.
Methods
An advanced search of the published literature on HIV drug resistance in India was performed in the PubMed and Scopus databases. Data pertaining to age, sex, CD4 count, viral load, and prevalence of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)/non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) DRM were extracted from each publication. Year-wise Indian HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) sequences were retrieved from the Los Alamos HIV database and mutation analyses were performed. A time trend analysis of the proportion of sequences showing NRTI resistance mutations among individuals exposed to first-line ART was conducted.
Results
Overall, 23 studies (1046 unique RT sequences) were identified indicating a prevalence of drug resistance to NRTI and NNRTI. The proportion of RT sequences with any DRM, any NRTI DRM, and any NNRTI DRM was 78.39%, 68.83%, and 73.13%, respectively. The temporal trend analysis of individual DRM from sequences retrieved during 2004–2014 indicated a rising trend in K65R mutations (p=0.013).
Conclusions
Although the overall burden of resistance against first-line ART agents remained steady over the study decade, periodic monitoring is essential. There is the need to develop an HIV-1 subtype C-specific resistance database in India."

To evaluate the feasibility of the implementation of a commercial rapid molecular diagnostic test (Xpert MTB/RIF) for the routine diagnosis of smear-negative or extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and its diagnostic accuracy, and to assess HIV prevalence in a real-life setting in Madagascar. This study was set in a tertiary care hospital in Madagascar.
Methods
A prospective cohort study was conducted of all consecutive cases with suspected smear-negative and/or extrapulmonary TB over a 2-year period. Cases were classified as proven, probable, or possible TB cases, or as having an alternative diagnosis.
Results
Of the 363 patients included, 183 (50.4%) had suspected smear-negative pulmonary TB and 180 (49.6%) had suspected extrapulmonary TB. For proven cases, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of Xpert MTB/RIF were 82.4%, 98.8%, 98.3%, and 86.6%, respectively; for proven and probable cases grouped together, these values were 65%, 98.8%, 98.5%, and 64%, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy was slightly lower for extrapulmonary TB compared to smear-negative pulmonary TB. The prevalence of HIV infection was 12.1%, but almost half of these cases did not have TB (alternative diagnosis group).
Conclusions
The implementation of a rapid diagnosis programme for TB in a resource-poor setting is feasible. The performance of the Xpert-MTB/RIF was remarkable in this difficult-to-diagnose population. HIV prevalence in this study was much higher than the prevalence reported in the general population in Madagascar, in patients with TB and patients with conditions other than TB."

Methods
SmKI-1 is a 16-kDa Kunitz-type protease inhibitor present in the excretory–secretory products and tegument of adult worms and eggs of Schistosoma mansoni. Two independent vaccine trials were performed in mice to determine the efficacy of rSmKI-1 in developing protective immunity.
Results
The results obtained showed reductions of 23–33% in adult worms, 28–31% in intestinal eggs, 33–39% in faecal eggs, and 20–43% in liver eggs. Furthermore, rSmKI-1 significantly increased the production of interferon gamma, interleukin (IL)-10, and IL-6 in vaccinated mice, maintaining a Th1/Th2-type balanced protective response.
Conclusions
rSmKI-1 generated partial protection against schistosomiasis mansoni in the murine model of infection and could be developed as part of a combination vaccine with other vaccine candidates to provide an even more solid level of protection."

Brucellosis is the most common zoonotic infection in the world. Brucellosis with nervous system involvement is known as ‘neurobrucellosis’ (NB). The diagnosis of NB is difficult because its clinical manifestations are non-specific and the sensitivity of routine culture tests is low.
Methods
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was used to detect pathogens in patients with clinically suspected central nervous system (CNS) infections at a tertiary referral center in China between June 1, 2016 and June 1, 2017. The clinical characteristics and NGS results of patients with the diagnosis of NB were reviewed in this study.
Results
Four patients were rapidly diagnosed with NB using NGS of the CSF in patients with clinically suspected CNS infections, although the clinical manifestations varied dramatically between these patients. NGS of the CSF revealed that the sequence reads identified that corresponded to Brucella species ranged from 11 to 104, with genomic coverage ranging from 0.043% to 0.4%. Rapid diagnosis led to prompt treatment with the appropriate antibiotics.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates the power of NGS of the CSF coupled with a bioinformatic pipeline in the diagnosis of NB."

Lassa fever (LF), a priority emerging pathogen likely to cause major epidemics, is endemic in much of West Africa and is difficult to distinguish from other viral hemorrhagic fevers, including Ebola virus disease (EVD). Definitive diagnosis requires laboratory confirmation, which is not widely available in affected settings. The public health action to contain a LF outbreak and the challenges encountered in an EVD-affected setting are reported herein.
Methods
In February 2016, a rapid response team was deployed in Liberia in response to a cluster of LF cases. Active case finding, case investigation, contact tracing, laboratory testing, environmental investigation, risk communication, and community awareness raising were undertaken.
Results
From January to June 2016, 53 suspected LF cases were reported through the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response system (IDSR). Fourteen cases (26%) were confirmed for LF, 14 (26%) did not have a sample tested, and 25 (47%) were classified as not a case following laboratory analysis. The case fatality rate in the confirmed cases was 29%. One case of international exportation was reported from Sweden. Difficulties were identified in timely specimen collection, packaging, and transportation (in confirmed cases, the time from sample collection to sample result ranged from 2 to 64 days) and a lack of response interventions for early cases.
Conclusions
The delay in response to this outbreak could have been related to a number of challenges in this EVD-affected setting: a need to strengthen the IDSR system, develop preparedness plans, train rapid response teams, and build laboratory capacity. Prioritizing these actions will aid in the timely response to future outbreaks."

abstract = "Objectives
Pyrazinamide is a key drug in the first-line treatment regimen for tuberculosis, with a potent sterilizing effect. Although low pyrazinamide peak serum concentrations (Cmax) are associated with poor treatment outcomes, many resource-constrained settings do not have sufficient laboratory capacity to support therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). The objective of this study was to determine whether a colorimetric test of urine can identify tuberculosis patients with adequate pyrazinamide exposures, as defined by serum Cmax above a target threshold.
Methods
In the derivation study of healthy volunteers, three dose sizes of pyrazinamide were evaluated, and intensive pharmacokinetic blood sampling was performed over an 8-h period, with a timed urine void at 4h post-dosing. Pyrazinamide in urine was isolated by spin column centrifugation with an exchange resin, followed by colorimetric analysis; the absorbance peak at 495nm was measured. The urine assay was then evaluated in a study of 39 HIV/tuberculosis patients in Botswana enrolled in an intensive pharmacokinetic study. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were used to measure diagnostic accuracy. The guideline-recommended pyrazinamide serum Cmax target of 35mg/l was evaluated in the primary analysis; this target was found to be predictive of favorable outcomes in a clinical study. Following this, a higher serum Cmax target of 58mg/l was evaluated in the secondary analysis.
Results
At the optimal cut-off identified in the derivation sample, the urine colorimetric assay was 97% sensitive and 50% specific to identify 35 of 39 HIV/tuberculosis patients with pharmacokinetic target attainment, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.81 (95% confidence interval 0.60–0.97). Diagnostic accuracy was lower at the 58mg/l serum Cmax target, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.68 (95% confidence interval 0.48–0.84). Men were less likely than women to attain either serum pharmacokinetic target.
Conclusions
The urine colorimetric assay was sensitive but not specific for the detection of adequate pyrazinamide pharmacokinetic exposures among HIV/tuberculosis patients in a high-burden setting."

However, the reasons for this increase are not clearly understood. This study describes the change in age-specific JE virus (JEV) seroprevalence over time in Korea, with a view to understanding this transition.
Methods
A search of Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed, KoreaMed, Korea Education and Research Information Service, National Library of Korea, and the Seoul National University Medical Library was conducted using the keywords ‘Japanese encephalitis’ combined with ‘Korea’, ‘seroprevalence’, ‘seropositivity’, ‘seroepidemiology’, ‘serosurvey’, ‘immunity’, and ‘antibody’.
Results
Eighteen studies published between 1946 and 2012 were retrieved. In 1946, seropositivity was 51% in the 1–10 years age group, 79% in those aged 11–20 years, and 94% in those ≥61 years of age. In the 1970s, seropositivity in children and adolescents was low (10–59%); seropositivity in this group increased to 90–92% in 1984–1985, and increased further to 98% in 2012. Seropositivity among adults aged 41–50 years and 51–60 years in the 2010s ranged between 83.1% and 97.9% and between 77.5% and 98.3%, respectively.
Conclusions
The implementation of the universal JE vaccination programme in the 1980s has increased the seroprevalence of JEV in Korea, especially in children who are targeted for vaccination."

While Brazil has witnessed an unprecedented Zika (ZIK) epidemic, chikungunya (CHIK) has also recently come into prominence as a threat in the Americas. The aim of this study was to identify the regions with increased probabilities of ZIK and CHIK occurrence, based on environmental and social conditions.
Methods
A statistical Maxent model was used to assess the potential spatial risk of ZIK and CHIK dissemination; this considered the number of probable autochthonous ZIK and CHIK cases in 2015 and 2016, along with environmental variables and social indicators.
Results
Land use was the most significant variable that best defined the distribution of ZIK and CHIK. Of the social variables, garbage destination, type of sanitary installation, and pipe-borne water were the most significant. An estimated 65 million people in Brazil live in areas at high risk of ZIK and 75 million people in areas at high risk of CHIK. The southeast and northeast regions of Brazil presented the largest areas of high risk for both ZIK and CHIK.
Conclusions
Many areas across the Brazilian territory are exposed to ZIK or CHIK infection risks, which are related mainly to land use. The study findings offer valuable information to support time-sensitive public health decision-making at the local and national levels."

abstract = "Objectives
In China, the epidemic pattern of acute hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection has changed from waterborne outbreaks to foodborne sporadic cases. However, the clinical course of sporadic acute hepatitis E (AHE) has not been well defined.
Methods
Consecutive patients with AHE who were admitted to the Jinan Infectious Disease Hospital, Jinan, Shandong Province between January 2003 and December 2014 were evaluated and followed. Demographic data, clinical manifestations, results of laboratory tests, and outcomes were recorded. Risk factors for liver failure and death were analyzed.
Results
A total of 680 patients with AHE were identified during the study period. The incidence was highest in February, March, and April, accounting for about 41% of the cases. The male to female ratio was 5.1:1 (574/106). The average age was 50.9±12.8years. The prevalence rates of prodromal fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, and jaundice were 25.6%, 85.6%, 83.8%, and 92.8%, respectively. The median (range) serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, albumin, and platelet levels were 727 (8–6270) U/l, 300 (17–6226) U/l, 196.8 (8.0–1083) μmol/l, 33.0 (15.2–45.8) g/l, and 162 (10–589)×109/l, respectively. The prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was 18.5% (126/680) and of liver cirrhosis was 9.4% (64/680). Thirteen percent (89/680) of the cases progressed to liver failure, including 4.1% (28/680) with acute liver failure (ALF) and 9.0% (61/680) with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). Among patients with HBsAg positivity or cirrhosis, 28.6% (36/126) and 36.0% (23/64), respectively, progressed to ACLF. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that age >53years, prodromal fever, HBsAg positivity, cirrhosis, and thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150×109/l) were independently associated with the development of liver failure, with an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 2.5 (1.5–4.3), 1.9 (1.1–3.2), 3.7 (2.0–6.7), 2.1 (1.1–4.2), and 5.9 (3.3–10.4), respectively. The overall mortality was 5.6% (38/680), and the mortality rates in patients with and without underlying liver disease were 9.3% (22/237) and 3.6% (16/443), respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that hepatic encephalopathy, bilirubin >500μmol/l, international normalized ratio (INR)>2, and severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100×109/l) were independently associated with death, with an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 7.2 (2.4–21.8), 5.8 (1.9–17.2), 24.1 (7.9–73.3), and 10.8 (3.6–32.9), respectively.
Conclusions
In areas that are dual endemic for hepatitis B virus and HEV, the HEV vaccine for patients with obvious liver diseases is of significance. Thrombocytopenia is an important predictor of liver failure and mortality in sporadic AHE."

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes in tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) are non-specific and the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to their formation remain unclear. This study investigated brain perfusion in TBE patients using dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance perfusion imaging (DSC-MRI perfusion).
Methods
MRI scans were performed for 12 patients in the acute phase, 3–5days after the diagnosis of TBE. Conventional MRI and DSC-MRI perfusion studies were performed. Cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), mean transit time (MTT), and time to peak (TTP) parametric maps were created. The bilateral frontal, parietal, and temporal subcortical regions and thalamus were selected as regions of interest. Perfusion parameters of TBE patients were compared to those of a control group.
Results
There was a slight increase in CBF and CBV, with significant prolongation of TTP in subcortical areas in the study subjects, while MTT values were comparable to those of the control group. A significant increase in thalamic CBF (p<0.001) and increased CBV (p<0.05) were observed. Increased TTP and a slight reduction in MTT were also observed within this area.
Conclusions
The DSC-MRI perfusion study showed that TBE patients had brain perfusion disturbances, expressed mainly in the thalami. These results suggest that DSC-MRI perfusion may provide important information regarding the areas affected in TBE patients."

People who inject drugs (PWID) are at high risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection by sharing needles and drug use paraphernalia. In Germany, no routine surveillance of HBV prevalence and vaccination coverage among PWID exists.
Methods
Socio-demographic and behavioural data were collected between 2011 and 2014 through face-to-face interviews, during a bio-behavioural survey of PWID recruited in eight German cities. Dried blood spots (DBS) prepared with capillary blood were tested for HBV markers. Factors associated with past/current HBV infection and vaccination status were analysed by univariable and multivariable analysis using logistic regression. The validity of self-reported HBV infection and vaccination status was analysed by comparison to the laboratory results.
Results
Among 2077 participants, the prevalence of current HBV infection was 1.1%, of past HBV infection was 24%, and of vaccine-induced HBV antibodies was 32%. No detectable HBV antibodies were found in 43%. HBV infection status was significantly associated with study city, age, years of injecting, use of stimulants, migration status, and homelessness; HBV vaccination status was significantly associated with study city, age, and level of education. Correct infection status was reported by 71% and correct vaccination status by 45%.
Conclusions
HBV seroprevalence among PWID was about five times higher than in the general population in Germany, confirming PWID as an important risk group. Targeted information campaigns on HBV and HBV prevention for PWID and professionals in contact with PWID need to be intensified. Routinely offered HBV vaccination during imprisonment and opioid substitution therapy would likely improve vaccination rates among PWID."

To find out the association between Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) genotypes 16/18 in Pakistani patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).
Methods
DNA from oral rinse of 300 subjects was taken. The subjects included 100 cases with OSCC and 200 controls. Samples were analyzed by both conventional and real time PCR using “HPV consensus Gp5+/Gp6+ and HPV 16, 18 specific primers”.
Results
Out of 300 persons, 74/300 (25%) were found to be infected with HPV: “46/100(46%) from cases and 74/200(14%) from controls”. The distribution was: HPV16, 6/300 (8%): 4/100 (9%) from OSCC group and 2/200 (8%) from controls while HPV 18 was 9/300(12%): 5/100(11%) from cases and 4/200(16%) from controls. Out of 300 subjects, 26(35%) were infected by “both HPV 16/18 (23(50%) from cases and 3(12%) from controls”. Persons who were infected with HPV 16&18 had higher chances to develop OSCC as compared to those who didn’t have HPV 16/18 (AOR: 21.4, 95% CI: 5.73 – 80.8).

Several articles have provided conflicting results regarding the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of the TNF gene in susceptibility to sepsis. Former articles have been based on previous definitions of sepsis. This study investigated the influence of TNF haplotypes on the development of sepsis using the new Sepsis-3 definitions.
Methods
DNA was isolated from patients suffering from infection and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Haplotyping was performed for six SNPs of TNF. The serum levels of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) of these patients were measured using an enzyme immunosorbent assay. Patients were classified into infection and sepsis categories using the Sepsis-3 definitions. Associations between the TNF haplotypes and the clinical characteristics and serum TNF-α levels of the patients were examined.
Results
The most common TNF haplotype h1 was composed of major alleles of the studied SNPs. Carriage of haplotypes composed of minor frequency alleles was associated with a lower risk of developing sepsis (odds ratio 0.41, 95% confidence interval 0.19–0.88, p=0.022), but this did not affect the 28-day outcome. Serum TNF-α levels were significantly higher among patients homozygous for h1 haplotypes who developed sepsis compared to infection (p=0.032); a similar result was not observed for patients carrying other haplotypes.
Conclusions
Haplotypes containing minor frequency SNP alleles of TNF protect against the development of sepsis without affecting the outcome."

Schistosomiasis control is centred on preventive chemotherapy through mass drug administration (MDA). However, endemic countries continue to struggle to attain target coverage rates and patient compliance. In the Philippines, barangay health workers (BHWs) play a vital role in the coordination of MDA, acting as advocates, implementers, and educators. The aim of this study was to determine whether BHW knowledge and attitudes towards schistosomiasis and MDA is sufficient and correlated with resident knowledge and drug compliance.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2015 among 2186 residents and 224 BHWs in the province of Northern Samar, the Philippines using a structured survey questionnaire.
Results
BHWs showed good familiarity on how schistosomiasis is acquired and diagnosed. Nevertheless, both BHWs and residents had poor awareness of the signs and symptoms of schistosomiasis, disease prevention, and treatment options. There was no correlation between the knowledge scores of the BHWs and the residents (r=0.080, p=0.722). Kruskal–Wallis analysis revealed significant differences in BHW knowledge scores between the low (3.29, 95% confidence interval 3.16–3.36), moderate (3.61, 95% confidence interval 3.49–3.69), and high (4.05, 95% confidence interval 3.77–4.13) compliance village groups (p=0.002), with the high compliance areas having the highest mean knowledge scores.
Conclusions
This study highlights the importance of community health workers in obtaining the World Health Organization drug coverage rate of 75% and improving compliance with MDA in the community. Investing in the education of community health workers with appropriate disease-specific training is crucial if disease elimination is ultimately to be achieved."

Spondylodiscitis is an infection of the vertebral column, the incidence of which is increasing due to an increase in the susceptible population and improved ascertainment. This disease has been associated with a wide range of microorganisms. Fungal spondylodiscitis is uncommon (0.5–1.6%) and strongly associated with immunosuppression and diabetes (Gouliouris et al., 2010). A rare case of Candida glabrata spondylodiscitis in a non-neutropenic diabetic patient is reported herein, along with a review of the literature.
Case report
A case of C. glabrata spondylodiscitis of L3–L4 metameres was diagnosed. The diagnosis was obtained through open biopsy of an abscess and culture examination. The patient was treated with anidulafungin and surgical debridement of the lesion.
Conclusions
The diagnosis of spondylodiscitis is often delayed or missed. Physicians should consider this entity in the differential diagnosis of lumbar pain in order to initiate an appropriate therapy to prevent spinal cord lesions and disability. This is particularly relevant in the case of a fungal aetiology, as there is a recognized global shift towards invasive candidiasis due to non-albicans Candida species, in particular C. glabrata, which has variable susceptibility to antifungal drugs."

Methods
Clinical and laboratory information was collected from patients with exudative pleural effusion attending two reference hospitals in Lima, Peru. Predictive findings associated with PT in a multiple logistic regression model were used to develop the CPR. A definite diagnosis of PT was based on a composite reference standard including bacteriological and/or histological analysis of pleural fluid and pleural biopsy specimens.
Results
A total of 238 patients were included in the analysis, of whom 176 had PT. Age, sex, previous contact with a TB patient, presence of lymphadenopathy, and pleural adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels were found to be independently associated with PT. These predictive findings were used to construct a CPR, for which the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was 0.92. The single best cut-off point was a score of ≥60 points, which had a sensitivity of 88%, specificity of 92%, a positive likelihood ratio of 10.9, and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.13.
Conclusions
The CPR is accurate for the diagnosis of PT and could be useful for treatment initiation while avoiding pleural biopsy. A prospective evaluation is needed before its implementation in different settings."

abstract = "Background
Globally, cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women and the seventh most common cancer overall, accounting for an estimated 300 000 annual deaths. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the second most common cause of cervical cancer worldwide. HPV screening is not a common practice in Pakistan. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of HPV and HPV types in women with a normal cytology of the cervix living in the upper and lower regions of Punjab, Pakistan, and to analyze the risk factors for HPV in this region.
Methods
PCR analysis was performed for 1011 female patients with a normal cytology of the cervix from various districts of Punjab Province, Pakistan. Risk factors for the acquisition of HPV were studied. High-risk HPV types (HPV16 and HPV18) were detected using the Abbott Real Time HR HPV test. To determine the genotype, partial L1 region sequences of HPV-positive samples were subjected to sequencing using MY/09/MY11 primers, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using CLC software.
Results
The study found a 4.74% prevalence of HPV, with the most frequent HPV type found being the low-risk HPV6 (in 25% of infected individuals), followed by HPV55 (22.9%), HPV11 (20.8%), and high-risk types HPV45 (12.5%), HPV33 (8.33%), HPV18 (6.25%), and HPV16 (4.16%). Phylogenetic analysis of all HPV types in this study showed 80–99% nucleotide identity with types related to the same species. The sequences were clustered with China, India, Mexico, Iran, Slovenia, and Germany, showing the diversity in origin of the various genotypes prevalent in Pakistan.
Conclusions
In this population with a normal cervical cytology, the prevalence of high-risk HPV types was very low. The major prevalent HPV genotype in Punjab Province of Pakistan was the low-risk HPV type 6, followed by HPV type 55. Sequencing of the partial L1 region suggested that the region was highly conserved in all reported sequences. This study highlights the need to conduct robust epidemiological studies in the region and to develop regular HPV screening so that the situation does not reach an alarming stage resulting in cervical cancer."

This study compared the yield of tuberculosis (TB) among contacts of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) index cases with that in drug-sensitive TB (DS-TB) index cases in a program setting.
Methods
A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted among contacts of sputum smear-positive new DS-TB index cases and MDR-TB index cases. After contacts were screened, GeneXpert was used for the diagnosis of TB.
Results
The study included 111 MDR-TB and 119 DS-TB index cases. A total of 340 and 393 contacts of MDR-TB and DS-TB index cases, respectively, were traced, of whom 331 among MDR-TB contacts and 353 among DS-TB contacts were screened. There were 20 (6%) presumptive TB cases for MDR-TB contacts and 41 (11%) for DS-TB contacts. The prevalence of TB among MDR-TB contacts was 2.7% and among DS-TB contacts was 4.0%. The majority of the MDR-TB contacts diagnosed with TB had MDR-TB; the reverse was true for DS-TB.
Conclusions
The yield of TB among contacts of MDR-TB and DS-TB patients using GeneXpert was high as compared to the population-level prevalence. The likelihood of diagnosing rifampicin-resistant TB among contacts of MDR-TB index cases was higher in comparison with contacts of DS-TB index cases. The use of GeneXpert in DS-TB contact investigation has the added advantage of diagnosing rifampicin-resistant TB cases when compared to the use of the nationally recommended acid-fast bacillus (AFB) microscopy for DS-TB contact investigation."

abstract = "Objective
A cross-sectional community prevalence survey was conducted to investigate the sero-epidemiological features of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection among children aged 1–14 years in Guangdong Province in 2013, and to provide baseline data for the evaluation of HBV disease burden and the impacts of HBV control.
Methods
A total of 2765 children aged 1–14 years from 16 villages/streets of eight cities in Guangdong Province were recruited as subjects. A blood sample was obtained from each subject. A chemiluminescence microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) was used to detect hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAb), and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAb).
Results
The prevalence rates of HBsAg, HBsAb, and HBcAb among children aged 1–14 years were 1.16%, 61.63%, and 2.35%, respectively. The prevalence of HBsAg and HBcAb increased with increasing age, and the prevalence was lowest in the 1–4 years age group (0.97% for HBsAg and 1.45% for HBcAb). In contrast, the prevalence of HBsAb decreased with increasing age; however the prevalence was also highest in the 1–4 years age group (76.48%). Eastern Guangdong had the highest prevalence of HBsAg and HBcAb, and the lowest prevalence of HBsAb. The prevalence of HBsAg was under 1% in the Pearl River Delta and western Guangdong regions. Children who had received three or more doses of vaccine had a lower prevalence of HBsAg and HBcAb and a higher prevalence of HBsAb compared to those who had received fewer than three doses of vaccine.
Conclusions
The prevalence of HBsAg among children aged 1–14 years in Guangdong in 2013 was 1.2%, showing a dramatic decrease compared to the 1992 provincial-level cross-sectional survey (19.9%). Children aged 1–4 years and children from the Pearl River Delta had the lowest prevalence of HBsAg positivity. High vaccination coverage among children and timely vaccination of newborns has played an important role in reducing the prevalence of HBsAg."

abstract = "Background
The effectiveness of the new generation of hepatitis C treatments named direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) depends on the genotype, subtype, and resistance-associated substitutions present in individual patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate a massive sequencing platform for the analysis of genotypes and subtypes of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in order to optimize therapy.
Methods
A total of 84 patients with hepatitis C were analyzed. The routine genotyping methodology for HCV used at the study institution (Versant HCV Assay, LiPA) was compared with a deep sequencing platform (454/GS-Junior and Illumina MiSeq).
Results
The mean viral load in these HCV patients was 6.89×106±7.02×105. Viral genotypes analyzed by LiPA were distributed as follows: 26% genotype 1a (22/84), 55% genotype 1b (46/84), 1% genotype 1 (1/84), 2.5% genotype 3 (2/84), 6% genotype 3a (5/84), 6% genotype 4a/c/d (5/84). When analyzed by deep sequencing, the samples were distributed as follows: 27% genotype 1a (23/84), 56% genotype 1b (47/84), 8% genotype 3a (7/84), 5% genotype 4d (4/84), 2.5% genotype 4f (2/84). Six of the 84 patients (7%) were infected with more than one subtype. Among these, 33% (2/6) failed DAA-based triple therapy.
Conclusions
The detection of mixed infection could explain some treatment failures. Accurate determination of viral genotypes and subtypes would allow optimal patient management and improve the effectiveness of DAA therapy."

This study was performed to analyze the Canadian invasive serogroup W Neisseria meningitidis (MenW) sequence type 11 (ST-11) clonal complex (CC) isolates by whole genome typing and to compare Canadian isolates with similar isolates from elsewhere.
Methods
Whole genome typing of 30 MenW ST-11 CC, 20 meningococcal group C (MenC) ST-11 CC, and 31 MenW ST-22 CC isolates was performed on the Bacterial Isolate Genome Sequence database platform. Canadian MenW ST-11 CC isolates were compared with the 2000 MenW Hajj outbreak strain, as well as with MenW ST-11 CC from other countries.
Results
Whole genome typing showed that the Canadian MenW ST-11 CC isolates were distinct from the traditional MenW ST-22 CC; they were not capsule-switched contemporary MenC strains that incorporated MenW capsules. While some recent MenW disease cases in Canada were caused by MenW ST-11 CC isolates showing relatedness to the 2000 MenW Hajj strain, many were non-Hajj isolates similar to current MenW ST-11 isolates found globally. Geographical and temporal variations in genotypes and surface protein antigen genes were found among the MenW ST-11 CC isolates.
Conclusions
The current MenW ST-11 isolates did not arise by capsule switching from contemporary MenC ST-11 isolates. Both the Hajj-related and non-Hajj MenW ST-11 CC strains were associated with invasive meningococcal disease in Canada."

The Hajj mass gathering is a risk for pneumococcal disease. This study was performed to evaluate the proportion of adult community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) cases attributable to Streptococcus pneumoniae among Hajj pilgrims in 2016. To add sensitivity to etiological attribution, a urine antigen test was used in addition to culture-based methods.
Methods
Adult subjects hospitalized with X-ray-confirmed CAP were enrolled prospectively from all general hospitals designated to treat Hajj pilgrims in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Patients were treated according to local standard of care and administered the BinaxNow S. pneumoniae urine antigen test.
Results
From August 23 to September 23, 2016, a total of 266 patients with CAP were enrolled in the study, 70.6% of whom were admitted to hospitals in Mecca; 53% of the cases were admitted after the peak of Hajj. Patients originated from 43 countries. Their mean age was 65.3 years and the male to female ratio was 2:1. Just over 36% of the cases had diabetes, 10% declared that they were smokers, and 45.4% of cases were treated in the intensive care unit (ICU). The overall case-fatality rate was 10.1%, but was higher among those treated in the ICU and in those with invasive disease. The proportion of CAP cases positive for S. pneumoniae, based on culture or urine antigen test, was 18.0% (95% confidence interval 13.9–23.1%).
Conclusions
CAP during Hajj has an important clinical impact. A proportion of CAP cases among Hajj pilgrims were attributable to S. pneumoniae, a pathogen for which vaccines are available. Additional studies to determine the serotypes causing pneumococcal disease could further inform vaccine policy for Hajj pilgrims."

abstract = "Background
Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious health problem in Papua New Guinea (PNG) with an estimated 30000 new cases and 3800 deaths each year. In the Balimo region of the Western Province, diagnosis relies on clinical manifestations and on the microscopic detection of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in sputum smears, a technique with limited sensitivity.
Methods
A molecular diagnosis assay targeting DNA extracted from archived sputum smear slides collected from the Balimo region (2012–2014) was conducted, without the need for a viable culture. The presence of Mycobacterium sp on 1162 slides prepared from 345 sputum samples was assessed using a real-time PCR (qPCR) approach.
Results
The qPCR technique identified the presence of mycobacteria in 35.4% of the smear slides and 59.7% of the tested sputum samples. Poor agreement was observed between the two diagnosis methods (smear AFB microscopy versus qPCR), with 100 AFB-positive sputum samples compared to 206 qPCR-positive sputum samples overall. Treatment was initiated in 90.2% of the smear-positive cases. Unnecessary treatment of ‘false-positive’ TB cases (AFB-negative/qPCR-negative) was very low (8.6%) and was even lower when the nine patients diagnosed with extrapulmonary TB were excluded from the analysis. However, the prevalence of false-negatives (AFB-negative/qPCR-positive) was high (28.5%).
Conclusions
Undetected smear-negative TB is occurring in the Balimo region of PNG, as well as some unnecessary empirical treatment. Molecular methods of diagnosis could greatly reduce the frequency of inappropriate clinical assessment, as well as providing point-of-care diagnosis. This may provide substantial patient and programmatic benefits, including lowering the economic burden on patients from rural areas seeking medical diagnosis in Balimo."

We aimed to determine risk factors associated with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and assess the contributions of these factors on CDI burden.
Methods
We conducted a 1:4 matched case-control study using a national claims dataset. Cases were incident CDI without a history of CDI in the previous 84 days, and were age- and sex-matched with control patients. We ascertained exposure, defined as a history of morbidities and drug use within 90 days. The population attributable risk (PAR) percent for risk factors was estimated using odds ratios (ORs) obtained from the case-control study.
Results
Overall, the strongest CDI-associated risk factors, which have significant contributions to the CDI burden as well, were the experience of gastroenteritis (OR=5.08, PAR%=17.09%) and use of antibiotics (OR=1.69, PAR%=19.00%), followed by the experiences of female pelvic infection, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and pneumonia, and use of proton-pump inhibitors (OR=1.52–2.37, PAR%=1.95–2.90).
Conclusions
The control of risk factors that had strong association with CDI and affected large proportions of total CDI cases would be beneficial for CDI prevention. We suggest performing CDI testing for symptomatic patients with gastroenteritis and implementing antibiotics stewardship."

Limited data on the diagnostic accuracy of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) have been reported in China. Therefore, a retrospective study was designed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of this assay.
Methods
Clinical, radiological, and microbiological characteristics of 238 patients with suspected PTB were reviewed retrospectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for the diagnosis of active PTB were calculated for the Xpert MTB/RIF assay using TB culture or final diagnosis based on clinical and radiological evaluation as the reference standard.
Results
The sensitivity and specificity of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay were 84.5% and 98.9%, respectively, and those for smear microscopy were 36.2% and 100%, respectively, when compared to the culture method. However, compared with the sensitivity and specificity of final diagnosis based on clinical and radiological evaluation, the sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 72.9% and 98.7%, respectively, which were significantly higher than those for smear microscopy.
Conclusions
The Xpert MTB/RIF assay on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid could serve as an additional rapid diagnostic tool for PTB in a high TB-burden country and improve the time to TB treatment initiation in patients with PTB."

abstract = "Background
Post-neurosurgical meningitis (PNM) is one of the most severe hospital-acquired infections worldwide, and a large number of pathogens, especially those possessing multi-resistance genes, are related to these infections. Existing methods for detecting bacteria and measuring their response to antibiotics lack sensitivity and stability, and laboratory-based detection methods are inconvenient, requiring at least 24h to complete. Rapid identification of bacteria and the determination of their susceptibility to antibiotics are urgently needed, in order to combat the emergence of multi-resistant bacterial strains.
Methods
This study evaluated a novel, fast, and easy-to-use micro/nanofluidic chip platform (MNCP), which overcomes the difficulties of diagnosing bacterial infections in neurosurgery. This platform can identify 10 genus or species targets and 13 genetic resistance determinants within 1h, and it is very simple to operate. A total of 108 bacterium-containing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures were tested using the MNCP for the identification of bacteria and determinants of genetic resistance. The results were compared to those obtained with conventional identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods.
Results
For the 108 CSF cultures, the concordance rate between the MNCP and the conventional identification method was 94.44%; six species attained 100% consistency. For the production of carbapenemase- and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-related antibiotic resistance genes, both the sensitivity and specificity of the MNCP tests were high (>90.0%) and could fully meet the requirements of clinical diagnosis.
Conclusions
The MNCP is fast, accurate, and easy to use, and has great clinical potential in the treatment of post-neurosurgical meningitis."

Methods
Throat swabs from patients with an ILI presenting to physicians in sentinel practices were collected during the 2016–2017 influenza season.
Results
A total of 52 samples tested positive by FilmArray Respiratory Panel. Forty percent were influenza A virus, and subtype H3N2 virus was the major epidemic strain. However, nearly 60% of ILI cases seen at sentinel sites were caused by non-influenza pathogens. The results of the FilmArray assay and cell culture were identical, and this assay was more sensitive than a rapid influenza diagnostic test. Genetic analyses revealed new influenza A H3N2 variants belonging to a novel subclade 3C.2a2.
Conclusions
The FilmArray assay facilitates urgent testing and laboratory surveillance for common viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens. This study demonstrated the use of a highly sensitive assay using clinical samples that is feasible for application worldwide. This may lead to an increased rate of diagnosis of viral infections and to improved patient outcomes, and in particular to a reduction in the overuse of antibiotics and antivirals."

Selecting the appropriate antibiotic regimen is extremely important in improving patient outcomes, minimizing antimicrobial resistance, and reducing costs. This study was conducted to evaluate current prescribing practices for empiric antibiotics at the time of admission to the emergency department (ED) and to assess their appropriateness in Lebanon.
Methods
A retrospective observational study was conducted at three different Lebanese hospitals between June and December 2016. Adult patients who received antibiotics in the ED during the study period were included. The assessment of antibiotic therapy based on adherence to international guidelines, including the choice of antibiotic, dosing, or both, was considered for analysis.
Results
A total of 258 patients who had a single diagnosis of an infectious disease were included. Adherence to international guidelines was noted in only 32.6% of cases; the frequency was highest for skin and soft tissue infections (50.0%), followed by urinary tract infections (40%). Among the different antibiotic classes, the highest percentage of drug incompatibility was for β-lactam prescriptions (70.8%). The percentage of incompatibility with guidelines for administered regimens on the basis of drug selection, dosing, or both was 53.4%, 10.3%, and 36.2%, respectively.
Conclusions
Inappropriate antibiotic use in the ED is prevalent, and physician adherence to international guidelines for empiric antibiotic prescriptions in the ED remains low. This emphasizes the importance of monitoring the use of antibiotics in the ED, as there is growing concern for antibiotic resistance and healthcare safety."

Necrotizing fasciitis following venomous snakebites is uncommon. The purpose of this study was to describe the initial clinical features of necrotizing fasciitis after snakebites, and to identify the risk factors for patients with cellulitis who later developed necrotizing fasciitis.
Methods
Sixteen patients with surgically confirmed necrotizing fasciitis and 25 patients diagnosed with cellulitis following snakebites were retrospectively reviewed over a 6-year period. Differences in patient characteristics, clinical presentations, snake species and laboratory data were compared between the necrotizing fasciitis and the cellulitis groups.
Results
None of the 41 patients died after being bitten by a snake. Twenty-nine patients (70.7%) were bitten by a cobra. Enterococcus species and Morganella morganii were the most common pathogens identified in wound cultures. Relative to the cellulitis group, the necrotizing fasciitis group had significantly higher rates of hemorrhagic bullae (p=0.000), patients with underlying chronic disease (p=0.019), white blood cell counts (p=0.035), segmented white cell counts (p=0.02), and days of hospitalization (p=0.001).
Conclusions
Victims of venomous snakebites should be admitted for close monitoring of secondary wound infections. The risk factors of developing necrotizing fasciitis from cellulitis following snakebites were associated with chronic underlying diseases and leukocytosis (total white blood-cell counts ≥10000cells/mm3 and ≥80% of segmented leukocyte forms). Physicians should be alert to a worsening wound condition after a snakebite, and surgical interventions should be performed for established necrotizing fasciitis with the empirical use of third-generation cephalosporins plus other regimens."

We identified 89 HFMD deaths which were separated into the PE group or non-PE group. Next, patients were divided based on their initial admission to hospitals as stage 1, 2, 3, or 4; at this point, their clinical manifestations were compared.
Results
There were 87 cases in the PE group, and 2 cases in the non-PE group. In the PE group, the difference in median time for patients at different stages from onset to symptoms, showed no significant difference (p>0.05). The etiology was detected as a positive rate for enterovirus 71 (EV71) of 89.19%, which showed a more severe course than other etiologies. The white blood cell (WBC) counts, lymphocyte (LYM) counts and creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) counts of patients admitted in different stages increased significantly with severity (p<0.05).
Conclusions
There may be two clinical subtypes, mostly PE and rarely non-PE, in the deceased patients with HMFD. EV71 and risk factors such as an increased WBC count are associated with a severe course of HMFD."

To investigate the risk factors for neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) in patients with severe hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) and to provide evidence for the prevention and treatment of NPE.
Methods
Several databases were searched (from inception to 2017) to identify case–control studies on risk factors for NPE among patients with severe HFMD. Data were analyzed via meta-analysis. The combined odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using fixed-effects and random-effects models, and a sensitivity analysis and evaluation of publication bias was also performed.
Results
A total of 14 studies involving 557 cases (severe HFMD with NPE) and 1450 controls (severe HFMD) were included. Results for the categorical variables were as follows: hyperglycemia (OR 10.25, 95% CI 4.82–21.76), tachycardia (OR 6.21, 95% CI 3.02–12.75), hypertension (OR 3.79, 95% CI 2.90–4.95), respiratory rhythm abnormality (OR 7.86, 95% CI 2.46–25.12), drowsiness (OR 8.11, 95% CI 4.26–15.44), vomiting (OR 8.96, 95% CI 3.83–20.96), limb tremors (OR 8.96, 95% CI 3.83–20.96), atypical rash (OR 4.27, 95% CI 2.83–6.45). No significant publication bias was found for the different factors.
Conclusions
Drowsiness ranks first among risk factors for NPE in children with severe HFMD, followed by vomiting, tachycardia, hypertension, breathing rhythm changes, limb tremors, atypical rash, and hyperglycemia."

abstract = "Objectives
Infection with rubella virus during pregnancy can result in congenital defects and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The risk of rubella infection is greatly determined by the level of rubella antibodies in the serum. A survey of rubella antibody seronegativity rates was conducted in 780 000 women in rural China who were planning a pregnancy, in order to evaluate the herd susceptibility in different age groups and by high, middle, and low GDP per capita regions.
Methods
In order to evaluate the herd susceptibility to rubella, a nationwide population-based study of rural Chinese women who were planning to have a baby and who were aged 21–49 years was instigated. As a part of the National Free Pre-conception Health Examination Project covering 29 provinces in 2012, a physical check-up program was provided to women who planned to become pregnant within the next 6 months. All medical data were from serological samples tested by ELISA, and the participants’ immunity status was categorized based on levels of rubella antibodies. Economic data were also collected to explore the association between herd susceptibility and socioeconomic characteristics in the women of childbearing age.
Results
A total 264 306 of 782 293 recruited women preparing for pregnancy tested susceptible to rubella (33.79%). The seronegativity rate in women with a history of vaccination was significantly lower than that in women who had not received the vaccination or did not know their vaccination history (23.76%, 33.70%, and 35.68%, respectively). The seronegativity rates were 26.89%, 37.86%, and 32.61% in high, middle, and low GDP per capita areas, respectively. After stratified analysis and adjusting for other factors by multiple logistic regression, the lower seronegativity rates in women in high GDP per capita regions compared to women in middle and low GDP per capita regions remained in the different age groups and subgroups of immunization history.
Conclusions
There is a clear difference in rubella-specific susceptibility among rural women preparing for pregnancy of different sociodemographic and economic backgrounds. The number of rubella-susceptible rural women preparing for pregnancy, especially in relatively low GDP per capita regions in China, was high. Offering rubella vaccination to women who are rubella-susceptible and who plan to become pregnant should become one of the priorities in the field of public health work in China."

Tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) poses a major public health problem in Nepal. Although it has been reported as one of the dominant genotypes of MTB in Nepal, little information on the Central Asian Strain (CAS) family is available, especially isolates related to multidrug resistance (MDR) cases. This study aimed to elucidate the genetic and epidemiological characteristics of MDR CAS isolates in Nepal.
Methods
A total of 145 MDR CAS isolates collected in Nepal from 2008 to 2013 were characterized by spoligotyping, mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit–variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) analysis, and drug resistance-associated gene sequencing.
Results
Spoligotyping analysis showed CAS1_Delhi SIT26 as predominant (60/145, 41.4%). However, by combining spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR typing, it was possible to successfully discriminate all 145 isolates into 116 different types including 18 clusters with 47 isolates (clustering rate 32.4%). About a half of these clustered isolates shared the same genetic and geographical characteristics with other isolates in each cluster, and some of them shared rare point mutations in rpoB that are thought to be associated with rifampicin resistance.
Conclusions
Although the data obtained show little evidence that large outbreaks of MDR-TB caused by the CAS family have occurred in Nepal, they strongly suggest several MDR-MTB transmission cases."

The purpose of this article is to review the epidemiology, natural history, mycology, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes associated with post-traumatic IFI in military and civilian populations. The epidemiology of post-traumatic IFI is poorly characterized, but incidence appears to be rising. Patients often suffer from severe injuries and require extensive medical interventions. Fungi belonging to the order Mucorales are responsible for most post-traumatic IFI in both civilian and military populations. Risk factors differ between these cohorts but include specific injury patterns and comorbidities. Diagnosis of post-traumatic IFI typically follows positive laboratory results in the appropriate clinical context. The gold standard of treatment is surgical debridement in addition to systemic antifungal therapy. Patients with post-traumatic IFI may be at greater risk of amputation, delays in wound healing, hospital complications, and death as compared to trauma patients who do not develop IFI. More research is needed to understand the factors surrounding the development and management of post-traumatic IFI to reduce the significant morbidity and mortality associated with this disease."

abstract = "Background
Ethiopia is one of the countries which has scaled up antiretroviral treatment (ART) over the past decade. This study reviews the performance of the ART program in Ethiopia during the past decade, and identifies successes and weaknesses toward ending AIDS in the country.
Methods
A review and synthesis of data was conducted using multiple data sources: reports from all health facilities in Ethiopia to the Federal Ministry of Health, HIV/AIDS estimates and projections, and retrospective cohort and cross-sectional studies conducted between 2005/6 and 2014/15.
Findings
The ART program has been successful over several critical areas: (1) ART coverage improved from 4% to 54%; (2) the median CD4 count/mm3 at the time of ART initiation increased from 125 in 2005/6 to 231 in 2012/13; (3) retention in care after 12 months on ART has increased from 82% to 92%. In spite of these successes, important challenges also remain: (1) ART coverage is not equitable: among regions (5.6%-93%), between children (25%) and adults (60%), and between female (54%) and male patients (69%); (2) retention in care is variable among regions (83%-94%); and, (3) the shift to second-line ART is slow and low (0·58%).
Interpretation
The findings suggest that the ART program should sustain the successes and reflect on the shortcomings toward the goal of ending AIDS. It is important to capitalize on and calibrate the interventions and approaches utilized to scale up ART in the past. Analysis of the treatment cascade, in order to pinpoint the gaps and identify appropriate solutions, is commendable in this regard."

To determine the annual incidence of prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) and to evaluate its current classification based on the epidemiological distribution of agents identified and their sensitivity profiles.
Methods
Consecutive cases of PVE occurring within the first year of valve surgery during the period 1997–2014 were included in this prospective cohort study. Incidence, demographic, clinical, microbiological, and in-hospital mortality data of these PVE patients were recorded.
Results
One hundred and seventy-two cases of PVE were included, and the global annual incidence of PVE was 1.7%. Most PVE cases occurred within 120days after surgery (76.7%). After this period, there was a reduction in resistant microorganisms (64.4% vs. 32.3%, respectively; p=0.007) and an increase in the incidence of Streptococcus spp (1.9% vs. 23.5%; p=0.007). A literature review revealed 646 cases of PVE with an identified etiology, of which 264 (41%) were caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci and 43 (7%) by Streptococcus spp. This is in agreement with the current study findings.
Conclusions
Most PVE cases occurred within 120days after valve surgery, and the same etiological agents were identified in this period. The current cut-off level of 365days for the classification of early-onset PVE should be revisited."

Background
The aim was to analyse TLR2 rs5743708, TLR2 rs4696480, TLR4 rs4986790, TLR9 rs5743836, and TLR9 rs352140 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in children with pneumococcal and meningococcal meningitis and their family members.
Methods
The study group consisted of 39 children with bacterial meningitis (25 with meningococcal meningitis and 14 with pneumococcal meningitis) and 49 family members. Laboratory test results and the course of the diseases were analyzed. Genomic DNA was extracted from 1.2ml of peripheral blood in order to analyze the five SNPs.
Results
Patients with pneumococcal and meningococcal meningitis showed a similar male/female ratio, mean age, and duration of symptoms. There were no statistically significant differences in biochemical markers between the two groups. All patients possessed at least one polymorphic variant of the analyzed SNPs. The most common SNP was TLR9 rs352140, detected in 89.7% of patients. No significant differences in SNP frequency were found between patients, family members, and the general population.
Conclusions
The allele frequencies in the population studied are in accordance with the literature data. The study did not find an association between the analyzed SNPs and susceptibility to bacterial meningitis. The role of SNPs in genes coding toll-like receptors and the interactions between them in controlling inflammation in the central nervous system needs further evaluation."

Israel has a long history of West Nile virus (WNV) morbidity, and the rate of detection of WNV in mosquitoes has been high since 2000. The aim of this study was to integrate several WNV datasets in order to gain an insight into the geographical distribution of WNV in Israel.
Methods
Three choropleth maps were generated showing WNV human morbidity, WNV prevalence in mosquitoes, and the results of a nationwide serological survey, based on the division of Israel into 15 sub-districts.
Results
The maps show a high endemicity of WNV in Israel. In respect to the morbidity map, the population residing in the central part of the country and in Arava Region is at higher risk of developing the disease than the population of the rest of Israel. Interestingly, high prevalence rates of both WNV serology and WNV-infected mosquitoes were detected in Arava Region, but lower prevalence rates were detected in most areas of the coastal region, suggesting that other factors might also be important in the development of symptomatic WNV infections.
Conclusions
These results underline the high prevalence of WNV in Israel and point to specific risk areas for WNV infections across the country."

Results
Vitamin D deficiency (<20ng/mL) was diagnosed in 68.3% of patients, and a total of 102 infections were detected. Urinary tract infections were the most common infections diagnosed (41.2%). Vitamin D deficiency rates were higher in patients with decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B vs A p=0.008, and Child-Pugh C vs A p=0.024).

An analysis was performed of the medical documentation of 359 children hospitalized for varicella on the infectious diseases ward at the Children’s Hospital in Poznan (Poland) between January 2007 and August 2015.
Results
Of the 359 children in the study group, 96 were younger than 1 year old. The most common cause of hospitalization was respiratory infections, found in 31 (32%) children. A severe course of varicella was observed in 38 (14%) children, and 21 (22%) developed skin infections, while 11 (11%) exhibited more than one complication. Treatment with acyclovir was implemented in 90 cases and parenteral antibiotic therapy was applied in 49 children. Contact with siblings suffering from varicella was confirmed in 46 children; for 16, the source of the infection was the mother.
Conclusions
The main source of varicella virus among hospitalized children in the first year of life is home contact. An infant may become infected from its mother suffering from zoster. Children who are exclusively breastfed and are born of mothers who have previously had varicella may develop varicella with a severe course during the first year of life."

To summarize published studies on the prevalence of and risk factors for maternal bacterial colonization and/or infection with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) in pregnant and/or post-partum women in Africa.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted using the PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. Bibliographies of included eligible studies were manually searched to identify additional relevant articles. No language restriction was applied. The timeframe of the search included all records from electronic database inception to July 15, 2017. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed to summarize the prevalence and the 95% confidence intervals (CI) of ESBL-E colonization or infection in pregnant or post-partum women in Africa. The meta-analysis was conducted using STATA IC 13.1 software and the metaprop function/plugin.
Results
Ten studies (seven on pregnant women and three on post-partum women) were included, documenting a 17% prevalence of maternal colonization with ESBL-E in Africa (95% CI 10–23%). The prevalence of ESBL-E in community isolates exceeded that in isolates from the hospital setting (22% vs. 14%). The most frequently reported ESBL-encoding gene was CTX-M (cefotaxime hydrolyzing capabilities). Data on risk factors for maternal ESBL-E colonization and infection are very limited.
Conclusions
The prevalence of colonization and/or infection with ESBL-E in pregnant and post-partum women in Africa exceeds that reported from high- and middle-income settings, representing a risk for subsequent neonatal colonization and/or infection with ESBL-E."

Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a simple and sensitive technique for rapid microbiological diagnosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the analytical and diagnostic performance of the LAMP eazyplex MRSA test for the direct detection and differentiation of methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in synovial/pleural fluid.
Methods
Analytical validation included the determination of the limit of detection (LoD) and analytical specificity of the eazyplex MRSA test. A diagnostic evaluation of the eazyplex test against bacterial culture was performed on routine pleural/synovial samples collected prospectively from patients aged less than 18 years with complicated pneumonia with empyema or arthritis admitted to the Children’s Hospital Sant Joan de Déu in Barcelona, Spain, between April 2015 and May 2016.
Results
The new system appropriately detected a quality control panel of clinical samples with DNA of MSSA, MRSA, and other pathogens. The LoD was established at 6.4×103 CFU/ml for S. aureus and 1.0×104 CFU/ml for MRSA. Diagnostic validation of the eazyplex MRSA assay was performed on 51 prospective clinical invasive samples, resulting in sensitivity and specificity values of 83.3% and 97.8%, respectively, for S. aureus detection. The mean turnaround time was 70min.
Conclusions
The eazyplex MRSA assay was found to be a useful test for the rapid detection of S. aureus in invasive samples such as pleural/synovial fluid."

To assess the efficacy and safety of a new single-tablet regimen (STR) of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) 300mg, lamivudine (3TC) 300mg, and efavirenz (EFV) 600mg in HIV-infected Thai patients.
Methods
This was a prospective study performed for 144 weeks among 51 treatment-naïve patients and 49 experienced patients on separate tablets of TDF, 3TC, and EFV with HIV RNA<50 copies/ml. CD4, HIV RNA, liver and renal function, and lipid profiles were assessed at baseline, weeks 12, 24, and 48, and then every 24 weeks.
Results
The median baseline CD4 cell count was 512 cells/μl for treatment-experienced patients and 230 cells/μl for treatment-naïve patients. Median baseline log10 HIV-1 RNA for treatment-naïve subjects was 4.9 copies/ml. From the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, the proportion of subjects with HIV RNA <50 copies/ml at week 48, 96, and 144 was 95%, 94%, and 94%, respectively, for antiretroviral-experienced patients and 88%, 90%, and 80%, respectively, for antiretroviral-naïve patients. One virological failure at week 12 had primary drug resistance of K70R, T69D, V75L. Three serious adverse events occurred (tension headache, infective endocarditis, and cervical dysplasia) and another three discontinued the study drug due to EFV intolerance.
Conclusions
This generic STR TDF/3TC/EFV is effective and well-tolerated. These findings lend support to the use of this generic STR as first-line antiretroviral therapy in resource-limited settings."

The aim of this review is to provide updated information on the clinical spectrum, treatment options, and infection prevention strategies for respiratory viral infections (RVIs) in both solid organ (SOT) and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients.
Methods
The MEDLINE and PubMed databases were searched for literature regarding the aforementioned aspects of RVIs, with focus on respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, and rhinovirus.
Results
Compared to immunocompetent hosts, SOT and HSCT patients are much more likely to experience a prolonged duration of illness, prolonged shedding, and progression of upper respiratory tract disease to pneumonia when infected with respiratory viruses. Adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus tend to have the highest mortality and risk for disseminated disease, but all the RVIs are associated with higher morbidity and mortality in these patients than in the general population. These viruses are spread via direct contact and aerosolized droplets, and nosocomial spread has been reported.
Conclusions
RVIs are associated with high morbidity and mortality among SOT and HSCT recipients. Management options are currently limited or lack strong clinical evidence. As community and nosocomial spread has been reported for all reviewed RVIs, strict adherence to infection control measures is key to preventing outbreaks."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of the identification of contacts of TB index cases on the outcomes of TB treatment.
Methods
This observational, cross-sectional, epidemiological study was conducted using data provided by SINAN-Net on subjects diagnosed with TB between 2008 and 2012 in Paraná, Brazil. The inclusion criteria were new cases of pulmonary TB in individuals older than 15 years.
Results
A total of 9867 new cases of TB were identified. In total, 29% of adult cases did not have their contacts examined, and of these, 61.8% were smear-positive. The adults whose contacts were not examined underwent fewer tests and presented a lower cure rate and higher rates of treatment dropout and death.
Conclusions
The detection of the contacts of index cases constitutes an epidemiological and public health strategy for the surveillance and control of TB. The health professionals who promote patient adherence to treatment and the involvement of their families in the fight against TB achieve better results regarding the identification of contacts of index cases, adherence to treatment, and cure."

To determine the seroprevalence of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection in patients with chronic hepatitis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to assess its potential consequences for disease progression.
Methods
We conducted a prospective case-control study on patients with HCC hepatitis B or C related and non-HCC patients including patients with CLD and patients without clinical evidence of liver disease. Anti-HEV IgG and IgM were tested by ELISA using commercially available kits. Liver damage was assessed by alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, platelets and prothrombin measurements.
Results
We observed a significant anti-HEV IgG carriage in HCC patients compared to non-HCC subjects with CLD (41.8% vs 12.6%; P=9.1 E-6; OR=4.8, 95%CI: 2.3-10.6). HCC patients with HEV infection display more profound alterations of circulating liver enzymes, platelets count and prothrombin time than HCC patients without sero-reactivity to HEV.
Conclusion
Overall, this study indicates a high prevalence of HEV infection in Cameroonian patients with CLD and HCC. These data suggest either that patients with liver tumors are more susceptible to hepeviral infection or that, in a tropical context, HEV might promote the progression of liver diseases towards tumor."

Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is a viral zoonotic disease. Butchers and slaughterhouse workers are considered to be high risk occupational groups for the disease. Sistan and Baluchistan province is an area in southeastern Iran which is endemic for CCHF, and the most confirmed cases of the disease are reported from this province. The aim of this study was to investigate the seroprevalence of CCHF and risk factors for seropositivity among them in Sistan and Baluchistan province in 2011.
Methods
Questionnaire data and blood sample collection were carried out for each participant and the sera samples were sent to the national reference laboratory for ELISA IgG testing.
Results
In this study, the seroprevalence of CCHF among 190 butchers and slaughterhouse workers from 11 counties was 16.49%. 79% of participants were aware that they were at risk of zoonosis and 39.7% did not use any personal protective equipment during their work. Of 31 CCHF IgG positive individuals in this study, eleven individuals had a previous record of CCHF infection in 57 months prior to the study.
Conclusions
High seroprevalence of CCHF among butchers and slaughterhouse workers and minimal use of personal protective equipment’s during daily work indicates the need for training courses, for these groups to increase their knowledge, attitude and practice with respect to zoonosis."

Background
This study was conducted to investigate changes in the clinical pattern of leptospirosis over time, analyzing its clinical and laboratory presentations in a metropolitan city of Brazil.
Method
This was a retrospective study including all patients with leptospirosis admitted to tertiary care hospitals in Fortaleza in the northeast of Brazil, between 1985 and 2015. Patients were divided into three groups according to the year of hospital admission: group I for the years 1985–1995, group II for 1996–2005, and group III for 2006–2015. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were compared between the groups.
Results
A total of 507 patients were included. Their mean age was 37.3±15.9years and 82.4% were male. The mean time between symptom onset and admission was 7±4 days. There was a linear decrease in the levels of serum urea (190.1±92.7, 135±79.5, and 95.6±73.3mg/dl, respectively, p <0.0001) and creatinine (5.8±2.9, 3.8±2.6, and 3.0±2.5mg/dl, respectively, p <0.0001) in each decade, while levels of hemoglobin (10.31±1.9, 10.8±2.0, and 11.5±2.1g/dl, respectively, p <0.0001) and platelets (57.900±52.650, 80.130±68.836, and 107.101±99.699×109/l, respectively, p<0.0001) increased. There was a tendency towards a linear decrease in mortality (22%, 14%, and 11.6%, respectively, p=0.060).
Conclusions
Leptospirosis showed significant changes over time in this region. The main changes point to a decrease in disease severity and complications, such as acute kidney injury. Mortality has decreased, being close to 11%."

Eosinopenia as a criterion of sepsis has been the subject of debate for decades. Different authors have proposed different cut-off values.
Methods
A prospective study was conducted from February to August 2016. Hospitalized adults suffering from a bacterial infection with eosinopenia, defined as an eosinophil count <100/mm3, were included. Patients were divided into two groups according to the first day of effective antimicrobial therapy. They were observed for 5days in order to evaluate whether recovery from eosinopenia was predictive of an appropriate antibiotic regimen.
Results
One hundred and twenty-two patients were screened and 96 were included. Group 1 patients (n=70) received effective antimicrobial therapy from day 0. Their eosinophil count increased significantly between day 0 and day 1 (p<0.0001). Group 2 patients (n=26) received delayed effective antimicrobial therapy, and there was no significant difference in eosinophil count between day 0 and day 1 (p=0.55). Moreover, eosinophil counts normalized on day 5 in both groups. The mean duration of antimicrobial therapy was comparable in the two groups (7.7±1.16 days). The antibiotics most often prescribed in both groups were intravenous cephalosporins. During follow-up, all patients were considered to be cured after day 30.
Conclusions
The eosinophil count appears to normalize faster than C-reactive protein (CRP) and polymorphonuclear neutrophils in eosinopenic patients on appropriate antimicrobial therapy. This simple test is easy to perform as part of a regular complete blood count, with no additional costs as required for CRP or procalcitonin."

Tremendous progress has been made in hepatitis B virus (HBV) prevention and control in the last 30 years in China, but it continues to be a major public health problem. The most recently reported population-based seroepidemiological survey on HBV in Shandong Province in China was published in 2006, and an updated baseline for HBV prevalence was badly needed in the province to identify the change in HBV epidemiology in the last decade.
Methods
Two population-based cross-sectional serosurveys were performed among the population aged 1–59 years in the same sample areas in Shandong Province, China in 2006 and 2014, respectively. Data on demographic characteristics were collected. A blood sample was obtained from each person and was tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody against HBsAg (anti-HBs), and antibody against hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc).
Results
Overall, the prevalence rates of HBsAg, anti-HBs, and anti-HBc were 3.39% (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.51–4.26), 44.96% (95% CI 41.34–48.57), and 24.45% (95% CI 22.19–26.71), respectively, among the population aged 1–59 years in the 2006 serovsurvey; the corresponding prevalence rates were 2.49% (95% CI 1.81–3.17), 48.27% (95% CI 45.63–50.92), and 22.56% (95% CI 20.14–24.97), respectively, in 2014. The prevalence rates of HBsAg and anti-HBc were lower in 2014 than in 2006. Conversely, the prevalence of anti-HBs showed an increase. However, none of these differences were statistically significant (all p>0.05). The prevalence of HBsAg showed an increase among persons aged 20–24 years in 2014 (3.83%) compared with 2006 (2.98%) (t=0.45, p=0.67). Among all occupation groups, the prevalence of HBsAg was lower in 2014 than in 2006, while the prevalence of anti-HBc showed moderate increases in students and farmers (all p>0.05). The prevalence of HBsAg decreased more obviously in urban areas (65.49%) than rural areas (7.07%) from 2006 to 2014.
Conclusions
The epidemiology of HBV infection has changed in Shandong Province, China over the last decade. More attention should be paid to HBV infection among students and farmers."

Acute respiratory infections are the leading cause of mortality in children worldwide, especially in developing countries. Pneumonia accounts for 16% of all deaths of children under 5 years of age and was the cause of death of 935000 children in 2015. Despite its frequency and severity, information regarding its etiology is limited. The aim of this study was to identify respiratory viruses associated with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children younger than 5 years old.
Methods
One thousand four hundred and four children younger than 5 years of age with a clinical and/or radiological diagnosis of CAP in 11 hospitals in Mexico were included. Nasal washes were collected, placed in viral medium, and frozen at −70°C until processing. The first 832 samples were processed using the multiplex Bio‐Plex/Luminex system and the remaining 572 samples using the Anyplex multiplex RT-PCR. Clinical data regarding diagnosis, clinical signs and symptoms, radiographic pattern, and risk factors were obtained and recorded.
Results
Of the samples tested, 81.6% were positive for viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus (types A and B) was found in 23.7%, human enterovirus/rhinovirus in 16.6%, metapneumovirus in 5.7%, parainfluenza virus (types 1–4) in 5.5%, influenza virus (types A and B) in 3.6%, adenovirus in 2.2%, coronavirus (NL63, OC43, 229E, and HKU1) in 2.2%, and bocavirus in 0.4%. Co-infection with two or more viruses was present in 22.1%; 18.4% of the samples were negative. Using biomass for cooking, daycare attendance, absence of breastfeeding, and co-infections were found to be statistically significant risk factors for the presence of severe pneumonia.
Conclusions
Respiratory syncytial virus (types A and B), human enterovirus/rhinovirus, and metapneumovirus were the respiratory viruses identified most frequently in children younger than 5 years old with CAP. Co-infection was present in an important proportion of the children."

abstract = "Summary
Background
After antibiotic therapy of an initial diabetic foot infection (DFI), pathogens isolated from subsequent episodes might become more resistant to commonly prescribed antibiotics. If so, this might require a modification of the current recommendations for the selection of empiric antibiotic therapy. This study investigated whether the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) DFI guideline recommendations should be modified based on the number of past DFI episodes.
Methods
This was a single-centre retrospective cohort survey of DFI patients seen during the years 2010 to 2016.
Results
A total 1018 episodes of DFI in 482 adult patients were identified. These patients were followed-up for a median of 3.3 years after the first DFI episode. The total number of episodes was 2257 and the median interval between recurrent episodes was 7.6 months. Among the recurrent DFIs, the causative pathogens were the same as in the previous episode in only 43% of cases (158/365). Staphylococcus aureus was the predominant pathogen in all episodes (range 1 to 13 episodes) and was not more prevalent with the increasing number of episodes. DFIs were treated with systemic antibiotics for a median duration of 20 days (interquartile range 11–35 days). Overall, there was no significant increase in the incidence of antibiotic resistance to methicillin, rifampicin, clindamycin, or ciprofloxacin over the episodes (Pearson’s Chi-square test p-values of 0.76, 1.00, 0.06, and 0.46, respectively; corresponding p-values for trend of 0.21, 0.27, 0.38, and 0.08, respectively).
Conclusions
After the successful treatment of a DFI, recurrent episodes are frequent. A history of a previous DFI episode did not predict a greater likelihood of any antibiotic-resistant isolate in subsequent episodes. Thus, broadening the spectrum of empiric antibiotic therapy for recurrent episodes of DFI does not appear necessary."

abstract = "Objectives
The study aimed at assessing the Tuberculosis (TB) medication adherence level and the efficacy of smear microscopy in the diagnosing pulmonary TB at month 2.
Methods
A prospective study was conducted at the four sites located in the Northern-western Tanzania. New smear positive, pulmonary TB patients were followed up and their adherence to TB medication assessed after 2 months of the treatment. In addition, the acid fast bacilli (AFB) smear microscopy was performed after 2 and 5 months of the treatment. All smear positive samples were subjected to geneXpert (MTB/RIF) assay and culture on the Lowenstein Jensen (LJ) media.
Results
A total of 331 smear positive, newly diagnosed patients with pulmonary TB were enrolled. The median age was 36 [Interquartile range (IQR): 28–45] years and males formed the slightly majority, 187 (56.5%) of the participants. A total of 105 (31.7%) patients were infected with HIV. Out of 331 patients, 36 (10.9%) were still AFB smear positive at the end of two month. Of these 19 (52.8%) were positive on GeneXpert MTB RIF and none was Rifampicin resistant. Of note, only 13 (31.1%) were culture positive (viable). None of the patients was positive at month 5. Poor adherence to TB medications in the first 2 months of treatment was observed in 56/331 (16.9%) [95% CI=12.9–21.0] of the patients.
Conclusion
Over two thirds of smear positive patients are wrongly put in one month extension of the intensive phase treatment; this may cause increased costs and drug toxicity. Culture should be advocated to confirm smear positivity after 2 months of medications. TB treatment drug adherence in our setting is good and is associated with successful cure. No multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) was observed. Continued surveillance and emphasizing of TB drug adherence should be kept upbeat in order to control tuberculosis in developing countries."

Plague is a virulent zoonosis reported most commonly from Sub-Saharan Africa. Early treatment with antibiotics is important to prevent mortality. Understanding knowledge gaps and common behaviors informs the development of educational efforts to reduce plague mortality.
Methods
A multi-stage cluster-sampled survey of 420 households was conducted in the plague-endemic West Nile region of Uganda to assess knowledge of symptoms and causes of plague and health care-seeking practices.
Results
Most (84%) respondents were able to correctly describe plague symptoms; approximately 75% linked plague with fleas and dead rats. Most respondents indicated that they would seek health care at a clinic for possible plague; however plague-like symptoms were reportedly common, and in practice, persons sought care for those symptoms at a health clinic infrequently.
Conclusions
Persons in the plague-endemic region of Uganda have a high level of understanding of plague, yet topics for targeted educational messages are apparent."

To determine genetic diversity by comparing the whole genome sequences of cattle and human Mycobacterium bovis isolates from Baja California.
Methods
A whole genome sequencing strategy was used to obtain the molecular fingerprints of 172 isolates of M. bovis obtained from Baja California, Mexico; 155 isolates were from cattle and 17 isolates were from humans. Spoligotypes were characterized in silico and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences between the isolates were evaluated.
Results
A total of 12 M. bovis spoligotype patterns were identified in cattle and humans. Two predominant spoligotypes patterns were seen in both cattle and humans: SB0145 and SB1040. The SB0145 spoligotype represented 59% of cattle isolates (n=91) and 65% of human isolates (n=11), while the SB1040 spoligotype represented 30% of cattle isolates (n=47) and 30% of human isolates (n=5). When evaluating SNP differences, the human isolates were intimately intertwined with the cattle isolates.
Conclusions
All isolates from humans had spoligotype patterns that matched those observed in the cattle isolates, and all human isolates shared common ancestors with cattle in Baja California based on SNP analysis. This suggests that most human tuberculosis caused by M. bovis in Baja California is derived from M. bovis circulating in Baja California cattle. These results reinforce the importance of bovine tuberculosis surveillance and control in this region."

abstract = "Objectives
Rapid epidemic detection is an important objective of surveillance to enable timely intervention, but traditional validated surveillance data may not be available in the required timeframe for acute epidemic control. Increasing volumes of data on the Internet have prompted interest in methods that could use unstructured sources to enhance traditional disease surveillance and gain rapid epidemic intelligence. We aimed to summarise Internet-based methods that use freely-accessible, unstructured data for epidemic surveillance and explore their timeliness and accuracy outcomes.
Methods
Steps outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist were used to guide a systematic review of research related to the use of informal or unstructured data by Internet-based intelligence methods for surveillance.
Results
We identified 84 articles published between 2006-2016 relating to Internet-based public health surveillance methods. Studies used search queries, social media posts and approaches derived from existing Internet-based systems for early epidemic alerts and real-time monitoring. Most studies noted improved timeliness compared to official reporting, such as in the 2014 Ebola epidemic where epidemic alerts were generated first from ProMED-mail. Internet-based methods showed variable correlation strength with official datasets, with some methods showing reasonable accuracy.
Conclusion
The proliferation of publicly available information on the Internet provided a new avenue for epidemic intelligence. Methodologies have been developed to collect Internet data and some systems are already used to enhance the timeliness of traditional surveillance systems. To improve the utility of Internet-based systems, the key attributes of timeliness and data accuracy should be included in future evaluations of surveillance systems."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Antimicrobials are drugs that were once lifesavers and mainly curative. Nowadays their value is increasingly under pressure because of the rapid and worldwide emergence of antimicrobial resistance, which, in low-resource settings, frequently occurs in microorganisms that are likely to be transmitted in the community.
Methods
This was a cross-sectional pilot study including 102 households within the 10th Health and Demographic Surveillance System round in Dande, Bengo Province, Angola.
Results
Of the total 102 households piloted, 79 (77.45%) were urban. Fifty-seven respondents were female (56.44%), and the mean age of the respondents was 39.70±15.35years. Overall, storage of antimicrobials was found in 55/102 households (53.92%). More than 66% of the antimicrobials stored were prescribed by a health professional and the majority of antimicrobials were bought at pharmacies or at a street market. Penicillin and its derivatives, antimalarial drugs, and metronidazole were the antimicrobials most frequently stored. Households with female respondents reported storing any drugs at home more frequently (82.50%; p=0.002) and also storing antimicrobials more frequently (64.91%; p=0.016) as compared to households with male respondents. Reported use of antimicrobials was significantly higher in urban households (60.76%, 48/79) as compared to rural households (30.43%, 7/23) (p=0.010). Overall, 74 of 101 respondents (73.26%) reported having already heard about antibiotics. The common reasons given for their use were cough and other respiratory symptoms, wounds, flu and body muscle pain, fever, bladder complaints, and diarrhoea and/or presumed typhoid fever. Nearly 40% (28/74) of the respondents thought that antibiotics should be stopped as soon as the person does not feel sick anymore.
Conclusions
Community interventions for appropriate use of antibiotics should be designed with a special focus on women. This should be done through public awareness campaigns and improving access to reliable medical services. Drug prescribers are key not only to appropriate antimicrobial prescription, but also to adequate dispensing, and are strong advocates for the possible misconceptions on antimicrobial usage by lay people."

To evaluate the performance of the Cobas TaqMan MTB assay (Cobas assay) with respect to its clinical application.
Methods
This was a retrospective analysis of 1154 results from 1034 patients for whom mycobacterial cultures and the Cobas assay were performed simultaneously. Based on the patient medical records, two categories of clinical application were defined: (1) the diagnosis of patients with a high probability of pulmonary tuberculosis according to clinical and radiological features (n=128), and (2) the exclusion of tuberculosis in clinically indeterminate patients (n=1026). Standard culture was used as the reference method.
Results
The sensitivity of the Cobas assay for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was 70.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 49.7–85.5%) for category 1, but only 25.0% (95% CI 4.5–64.4%) for category 2. The specificity was ≥95.0% for both categories. The positive predictive value was 79.2% (95% CI 57.3–92.1%) for category 1 and 33.3% (95% CI 6.0–75.9%) for category 2, while the negative predictive value was 92.3% (95% CI 85.0–96.4%) for category 1 and 99.4% (95% CI 98.7–99.8%) for category 2.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is a diagnostic challenge. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) and gallium-67 single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (67Ga SPECT/CT) in diagnosing FUO.
Methods
A total of 68 patients with FUO underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT and 67Ga SPECT/CT from January 2013 through May 2016. Images were read independently. The imaging results were compared with the final diagnosis and categorized as helpful for diagnosis or non-contributory to diagnosis in the clinical setting. Associations between categorical variables were evaluated with the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test.
Results
Ten of the 68 patients were excluded. An infectious underlying disease was found in 23 patients. A malignant disorder was the cause of FUO in 10 patients. Non-infectious inflammatory disease was found in 11 patients. Adrenal insufficiency was the cause of FUO in two patients. The cause of FUO was not found for 12 patients. A high false-positive rate of 44% (7/16) was observed for 18F-FDG PET/CT, while a high false-negative rate of 55% (23/42) was observed for 67Ga SPECT/CT. 18F-FDG PET/CT studies depicted all 67Ga-avid lesions. The sensitivity (79% vs. 45%) and clinical contribution (72% vs. 55%) of 18F-FDG PET/CT in diagnosing FUO were significantly higher than those of 67Ga SPECT/CT (p<0.05).
Conclusions
On the basis of this study, the diagnostic performance of 18F-FDG PET/CT is superior to 67Ga SPECT/CT in the work-up of patients with FUO. With its rapid results and superior sensitivity, 18F-FDG PET/CT may replace 67Ga SPECT/CT where this technique is available."

Although the literature indicates that patient delays in seeking medical support for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections are associated with poor clinical outcomes, delays in the diagnosis itself remain poorly understood in these patients. This study aimed to determine the median time interval from symptom onset to a confirmed diagnosis and to identify the potential predictors of this interval in Saudi Arabian MERS patients.
Methods
This was a retrospective study of patients with confirmed MERS who were publicly reported by the World Health Organization (WHO).
Results
Five hundred and thirty-seven symptomatic cases of MERS-CoV infection were included. The median time interval between symptom onset and confirmation of the MERS diagnosis was 4 days (interquartile range 2–7 days), ranging from 0 to 36 days. According to the negative binomial model, the unadjusted rate ratio (RR) of delays in the diagnosis was significantly higher in older patients (>65 years) (RR 1.42), non-healthcare workers (RR 1.74), patients with severe illness (RR 1.22), those with an unknown source of infection (RR 1.84), and those who had been in close contact with camels (RR 1.74). After accounting for confounders, the adjusted rate ratio (aRR) of delays in the diagnosis was independently associated with unknown source of infection (aRR 1.68) and close contact with camels (aRR 1.58).
Conclusions
The time interval from symptom onset to diagnosis was greater in older patients, non-healthcare workers, patients with severe illness, patients with an unknown source of infection, and patients who had been in close contact with camels. The findings warrant educational interventions to raise general public awareness of the importance of early symptom notification."

Objectives
To assess the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infections among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Nepal.
Methods
A sample of 677 PLHIV representing key affected populations (KAP) in Nepal, who were undergoing antiretroviral (ART) therapy in ART clinics around the country, were voluntarily enrolled in the study. Rapid kit-based testing followed by ELISA for validation was performed, focusing on HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies against HCV (anti-HCV). A multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with HBV and HCV co-infection.
Results
HCV and HBV co-infection among the 677 PLHIV was found to be 19% (95% confidence interval (CI) 16.6–22.7%) and 4.4% (95% CI 3.1–6.6%), respectively. The Eastern Region had the highest percentage of HCV infection (48%). The age group with the highest rates of co-infection was 30–39 years (58% and 70%, respectively, for HCV and HBV co-infection). After adjusting for confounding, males were more likely to have HBV co-infection than females (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 4.61, 95% CI 1.42–14.98). Similarly, PLHIV who were male (AOR 5.7, 95% CI 2.06–15.98), had a secondary level of education (AOR 3.04, 95% CI 1.06–8.70), or who were drug users (AOR 28.7, 95% CI 14.9–55.22) were significantly more likely to have HCV co-infection.
Conclusion
This first ever national assessment of HIV, HBV, and HCV co-infection performed among PLHIV in Nepal demonstrates that HCV and HBV infections are a health threat to this population and that interventions are required to mitigate the effects of co-infection and to prevent further morbidity and mortality."

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) blood stream infections (BSI) are a major health care problem accounting for a large percentage of nosocomial infections. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors associated with 30-day mortality in patients with MRSA BSI.
Methods
This was a retrospective study performed in Southeast Michigan. Over a 9- year period, a total of 1,168 patients were identified with MRSA BSI. Patient demographics and clinical data were retrieved and evaluated using electronic medical health records.
Results
30-day mortality during the 9-year study period was 16%. Significant risk factors for 30-day mortality were age, cancer, heart disease, neurologic disease, nursing home residence and Charlson score >3 with Odds Ratio (OR) of 1.03 (CI 1.02–1.04), 2.29 (CI 1.40–3.75), 1.78 (CI 1.20–2.63), 1.65 (CI 1.08–2.25), 1.66 (CI 1.02 − 2.70) and 1.86 (CI 1.18 − 2.95) correspondingly.

The aim of this study was to determine the impact of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) on primary liver cancer (PLC) in China north areas.
Methods
A total of 2172 histologically confirmed PLC patients attending the National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences during the period January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2014 were enrolled. Details of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibodies against HBV core antigen (anti-HBc), and antibodies against HCV (anti-HCV) status were recorded. Sequencing of the HBV PreS-S gene and the C/E1 and NS5B fragments of HCV was performed and the genotypes were analyzed for some of the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Results
Among the 2172 histologically confirmed PLC cases, 1823 (83.9%) had HCC and 238 (11.0%) had intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA). Among HCC cases, HBV infection alone, indicated by HBsAg-neg/pos+anti-HBc-pos, was found in 1567 (86.0%) cases; of these, 18.2% (331/1823) were HBsAg-neg+anti-HBc-pos. Serum HBV-DNA was detectable in 70% of HBsAg-neg+anti-HBc-pos HCC cases. The dominant HBV genotype was HBV-C2 (94.4%). HCV infection alone, indicated by anti-HCV-pos, was found in 2.5% (46/1823) of cases; HCV-1b (72.1%) was the dominant genotype. HBV+HCV co-infection markers were found in 6.7% (122/1823) of cases. Only 88 (4.8%) cases had no HBV and no HCV markers. Among the 238 iCCA cases, 54 (22.7%) were HBsAg-pos+anti-HBc-pos; none was anti-HCV-pos alone.
Conclusions
HBV remains the major contributor to PLC in China north areas Individuals with occult HBV infection should not be ignored in liver cancer screening."

abstract = "Background
The differentiation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) from non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) is of primary importance for infection control and the selection of anti-tuberculosis drugs. Up to date data on rifampicin (RIF)-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is essential for the early management of multidrug-resistant TB. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of a newly developed multiplexed, bead-based bioassay (Quantamatrix Multiplexed Assay Platform, QMAP) for the rapid differentiation of 23 Mycobacterium species including MTBC and RIF-resistant strains.
Methods
A total of 314 clinical Mycobacterium isolates cultured from respiratory specimens were used in this study.
Results
The sensitivity and specificity of the QMAP system for Mycobacterium species were 100% (95% CI 99.15–100%, p<0.0001) and 97.8% (95% CI 91.86–99.87%, p<0.0001), respectively. The results of conventional drug susceptibility testing and the QMAP Dual-ID assay were completely concordant for all clinical isolates (100%, 95% CI 98.56–100%). Out of 223 M. tuberculosis (MTB) isolates, 196 were pan-susceptible and 27 were resistant to RIF according to QMAP results. All of the mutations in the RIF resistance-determining region detected by the QMAP system were confirmed by rpoB sequence analysis and a REBA MTB-Rifa reverse blot hybridization assay. The majority of the mutations (n=26, 96.3%), including those missing wild-type probe signals, were located in three codons (529–534, 524–529, and 514–520), and 17 (65.4%) of these mutations were detected by three mutation probes (531TTG, 526TAC, and 516GTC).
Conclusions
The entire QMAP system assay takes about 3h to complete, while results from the culture-based conventional method can take up to 48–72h. Although improvements to the QMAP system are needed for direct respiratory specimens, it may be useful for rapid screening, not only to identify and accurately discriminate MTBC from NTM, but also to identify RIF-resistant MTB strains in positive culture samples."

The aim of this study was to describe the secular trends in drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) and to identify unique characteristics of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in rural China.
Methods
A retrospective study was conducted using TB data collected from 36 TB prevention and control institutions serving rural populations in Shandong Province, China, for the period 2006–2015.
Results
Approximately 8.3% of patients suffered from MDR-TB, among whom 70% were newly treated patients; this rate increased by 1.3% annually during the 10-year study period. An increase in the percentage of overall first-line drug resistance against isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and streptomycin was confirmed (p<0.05). The percentage of MDR-TB in new and previously treated cases increased at yearly rates of 9.9% and 11.1%, respectively. MDR-TB patients were more likely to be female (odds ratio (OR) 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32–1.89), smokers (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.47–2.07), to have had recent TB contact (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.04–2.42), or to have been retreated (OR 2.89, 95% CI 2.46–3.41).
Conclusions
Increasing MDR-TB and rates of primary MDR-TB characterize DR-TB cases in rural China. Persistent efforts need to be made among MDR-TB patients in future TB control strategies."

Objectives
The diagnosis of pediatric tuberculosis (TB) presents many challenges, and is further complicated in HIV-infected patients. While many diagnostic systems have been proposed, there is no pediatric TB diagnosis gold standard. The outcomes of four TB diagnostic systems in HIV-infected children were compared in this study.
Methods
A retrospective cohort study was conducted at a TB/HIV reference hospital in Rio de Janeiro. HIV-infected pediatric patients evaluated for TB from 1998 to 2010 were reassessed using four diagnostic systems: Kenneth Jones, 1969; Tidjani, 1986; Ben Marais, 2006; Brazilian Ministry of Health, 2010. Results were compared to standardized diagnoses made by an expert panel of physicians.
Results
Of the 121 patients in the study cohort, the expert panel diagnosed 64 as TB and 57 as not TB cases. The Tidjani system showed the highest diagnostic accuracy, with and without the inclusion of microbiological data. The Tidjani and Kenneth Jones systems produced fewer false-positives, and the Ben Marais and Ministry of Health fewer false-negatives. Across systems, there was little agreement between TB diagnoses.
Conclusions
In HIV-infected pediatric patients, the Ben Marais and Ministry of Health systems are useful for TB diagnostic screening, whereas the Tidjani and Kenneth Jones systems are best used in a reference center setting."

Two reported clinical isolates, the IMI-3-producing Raoultella ornithinolytica RJ46C and the IMI-2-producing Escherichia coli RJ18 were identified in our retrospective review of isolates collected from June 2010 to June 2013, both isolates were resistant to carbapenem but sensitive to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. The blaIMI gene was located on different ∼170-kb plasmids in both isolates. The blaIMI-3 gene was carried by the plasmid pRJ46C, which was extracted from the transconjugant and identified to be a 166,620-bp conjugative IncFIIY plasmid that contained 193 open reading frames, including replication-, plasmid conjugal transfer-, partitioning-, and mobilization-associated structures. The blaIMI-3 gene was located on a 15-kb region with a completely inverted sequence relative to that of plasmid pGA45, two ISEcl1-like elements containing two 33-bp complete inverted repeats were in an inverted orientation on both sides of the 15-kb region. We identified this typical structure as a novel composite transposon named Tn6306, indicating the occurrence of transposition. In addition, the blaIMI-2-carrying pRJ18 was an IncFIB plasmid, and a similar ISEcl1-like element was identified in an inverted direction upstream of IMI-2 in pRJ18. The identification of blaIMI in R. ornithinolytica and E. coli highlights the diversity of spreading carbapenemases in Enterobacteriaceae between hospitals and the environment in China. The novel transposon Tn6306, and other insert sequences, may play important roles in blaIMI mobilization."

Objectives
To evaluate the applicability and accuracy of the urine lipoarabinomannan (LAM) test in tuberculosis (TB)/HIV co-infected patients and HIV-negative patients with disseminated TB.
Methods
Frozen urine samples obtained at baseline from patients in the TB research cohort with proven culture-positive TB were selected for blinded urine LAM testing. One hundred and nine patients were categorized into four groups: (1) HIV-positive patients with TB; (2) HIV-negative patients with disseminated TB; (3) HIV-negative immunocompromised patients with TB; and (4) patients with diseases other than TB. The sensitivity of urine LAM testing for culture-positive TB, specificity of urine LAM testing for patients without TB, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were assessed.
Results
The sensitivity of the urine LAM test in group 1 patients with a CD4 T-cell count of >100, ≤100, and ≤50 cells/mm3 was 38.5%, 40.6%, and 45%, respectively. The specificity and PPV of the urine LAM test were >80%. The sensitivity of the test was 20% in group 2 and 12.5% in group 3, and the specificity and PPV were 100% for both groups. A positive urine LAM test result was significantly associated with death.
Conclusions
This promising diagnostic tool could increase the yield of TB diagnosis and may predict the mortality rate of TB infection, particularly in TB/HIV co-infected patients."

It has been demonstrated that infection with human parvovirus B19 (B19V) is associated with rash–fever illnesses. The present study aimed to investigate B19V as an aetiological agent of rash–fever syndromes in Congolese children confirmed as measles and rubella IgM-negative. An ELISA IgM test and PCR were performed to screen for B19V.
Methods
A total of 177 archived serum samples were randomly selected from the measles biobank of the National Institute for Biomedical Research (INRB). Samples were investigated for anti-B19V IgM and B19V DNA. These samples originated from children <5years of age with measles-like rashes, previously confirmed as negative for both measles and rubella IgM.
Results
Out of 177 serum samples tested by ELISA and 168 tested by PCR, 109 were positive for B19V IgM antibodies (61.6%) and 87 (51.8%) were positive for B19V DNA. Positive samples in both assays were from all provinces of DRC.
Conclusions
B19V plays a role in rash–fever illnesses in children under 5 years of age suspected of having measles or rubella infections in DRC. As an aetiological cause of rash and fever syndromes, the present study demonstrates that B19V should also be considered during the laboratory investigation of rash–fever illnesses in DRC, particularly in the paediatric population. There is a need to conduct further studies in order to gain a better understanding of the spatiotemporal pattern of B19V and to define the genotype(s) of B19V circulating in DRC."

Cases of undiagnosed severe febrile rhabdomyolysis in refugees coming from West Africa, mainly from Nigeria, has been observed since May 2014. The aim of this study was to describe this phenomenon.
Methods
This was a multicentre retrospective observational study of cases of febrile rhabdomyolysis reported from May 2014 to December 2016 in 12 Italian centres.
Results
A total of 48 cases were observed, mainly in young males. The mean time interval between the day of departure from Libya and symptom onset was 26.2 days. An average 8.3 further days elapsed before medical care was sought. All patients were hospitalized with fever and very intense muscle aches. Creatine phosphokinase, aspartate aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase values were abnormal in all cases. The rhabdomyolysis was ascribed to an infective agent in 16 (33.3%) cases. In the remaining cases, the aetiology was undefined. Four out of seven patients tested had sickle cell trait. No alcohol abuse or drug intake was reported, apart from a single reported case of khat ingestion.
Conclusions
The long incubation period does not support a mechanical cause of rhabdomyolysis. Furthermore, viral infections such as those caused by coxsackievirus are rarely associated with such a severe clinical presentation. It is hypothesized that other predisposing conditions like genetic factors, unknown infections, or unreported non-conventional remedies may be involved. Targeted surveillance of rhabdomyolysis cases is warranted."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a parasitic infection transmitted by mosquito vectors, and in Sub-Saharan Africa it is caused by the nematode Wuchereria bancrofti. The disease has been targeted for global elimination with the annual mass drug administration (MDA) strategy. Vector control is known to play an important complementary role to MDA in reducing the transmission of LF. The effects of an MDA and insecticide-treated net intervention implemented in an endemic area of southeastern Tanzania are reported here.
Methods
A cross-sectional study assessing W. bancrofti circulating filarial antigen (CFA) was conducted in five primary schools in five different villages. Standard one pupils aged 6–9 years were screened for CFA using immunochromatographic test cards (ICT), with a total of 413 screened in 2012 and 659 in 2015. Just after CFA testing, the children were interviewed on their participation in the MDA campaign. Moreover, 246 heads of households in 2012 and 868 in 2015 were interviewed on their participation in MDA and utilization of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs).
Results
The prevalence of CFA for the 413 children tested in 2012 was 14.3%, while it was 0.0% for the 659 children tested in 2015. The Tanzanian National Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination Programme reported annual treatment coverage for Rufiji District ranging from 54.3% to 94.0% during the years 2002–2014. The surveyed treatment was 51.6% in 2011 and 57.4% in 2014. With regard to LLINs, possession and utilization increased from 63.4% and 59.2%, respectively, in 2012, to 92.5% and 75.4%, respectively, in 2015.
Conclusions
The findings suggest that 12 rounds of MDA complemented with vector control through the use of insecticide-treated nets resulted in a marked reduction in W. bancrofti CFA in young school children."

This study aimed to investigate whether von Willebrand factor (vWF) and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) are associated with the severity and clinical outcome of scrub typhus and to seek novel biomarkers for surveillance and prediction of the prognosis of this infection.
Methods
Serum concentrations of vWF and HMGB1 were measured twice by ELISA for scrub typhus patients (n=103), once prior to doxycycline therapy and then on day 7 of doxycycline therapy; concentrations were measured once for healthy controls (n=32).
Results
Among the total 103 patients enrolled, 38 had disease complicated by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Serum concentrations of vWF and HMGB1 were significantly higher in all the patients than in the healthy controls, both prior to doxycycline treatment and on day 7 of doxycycline treatment (p<0.01). Furthermore, serum levels of vWF, HMGB1, and creatinine (SCr) in the patients with MODS increased distinctly, while the platelet (PLT) count diminished markedly compared to the levels in patients without MODS (p<0.01). The concentration of vWF was positively correlated with that of HMGB1 (r=0.764, p<0.001) and SCr (r=0.528, p<0.001), but negatively correlated with the PLT count (r=−0.632, p<0.001). Both HMGB1 and vWF were significantly associated with mortality in scrub typhus (area under the curve (AUC)=0.864, p=0.001, and AUC=0.862, p=0.001, respectively).

Objectives
Many studies have suggested the effectiveness of single control measures in the containment and mitigation of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009. The effects of combined interventions by multiple control measures in reducing the impact of an influenza A (H1N1) 2009 outbreak in a closed physical training camp in Beijing, China were evaluated.
Methods
Oseltamivir was prescribed for the treatment of confirmed cases and possible cases and as prophylaxis for all other participants in this training camp. Public health control measures were applied simultaneously, including the isolation of patients and possible cases, personal protection and hygiene, and social distancing measures. Symptom surveillance of all participants was initiated, and the actual attack rate was calculated. For comparison, the theoretical attack rate for this outbreak was projected using the Newton–Raphson numerical method.
Results
A total of 3256 persons were present at the physical training camp. During the outbreak, 405 (68.3%) possible cases and 26 (4.4%) confirmed cases were reported before the intervention and completed oseltamivir treatment; 162 (27.3%) possible cases were reported after the intervention and received part treatment and part prophylaxis. The other 2663 participants completed oseltamivir prophylaxis. Of the possible cases, 181 with fever ≥38.5°C were isolated. The actual attack rate for this outbreak of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 was 18.2%, which is much lower than the theoretical attack rate of 80% projected.
Conclusions
Combined interventions of large-scale antiviral ring prophylaxis and treatment and public health control measures could be applied to reduce the magnitude of influenza A (H1N1) 2009 outbreaks in closed settings."

abstract = "Background
Human brucellosis and recurrent brucellosis is an ever-increasing public health concern, especially in endemic areas like Iran. Nevertheless, little is known regarding the epidemiology and determinants of recurrent brucellosis. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate epidemiological patterns and potential determinants of recurrent brucellosis in Hamadan Province during the years 2009–2015.
Methods
Data on reported cases of new and recurrent brucellosis from 2009 to 2015 were obtained from the provincial Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System at Hamadan University of Medical Sciences. Incidence rates per 100000 were estimated at the county level. Binary logistic regression was used to estimate the effects of background characteristics and recurrent brucellosis. The power of discrimination of the model for recurrent brucellosis was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC).
Results
Among 7318 brucellosis cases, the total frequency (%) of recurrent cases was 472 (6.45%). The rate of recurrent brucellosis was higher in females, people aged 50 years and over, people with a history of consuming unpasteurized dairy products with no history of contact with animals, and in the winter season. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that female sex (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13–1.65), age ≥55 years (AOR 4.15, 95% CI 2.32–7.42), consumption of unpasteurized dairy products (AOR 1.16, 95% CI 0.96–1.40), and winter season (AOR 1.32, 95% CI 1.03–1.71) are potential risk factors for recurrent brucellosis. The final model that involved all the determinants showed moderate discrimination (AUC 0.61).
Conclusions
Female sex, older age, and winter months were found to be significant determinants of recurrent human brucellosis. Enhanced surveillance systems with an emphasis on these population characteristics will allow effective preventive and protective measures to be implemented and might alleviate the recurrence of brucellosis in the country."

Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is associated with substantial mortality in HIV-infected patients. Optimal timing of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in persons with CM represents a clinical challenge, and the burden of CM in Latin America has not been well described. Studies suggest that early ART initiation is associated with higher mortality, but data from the Americas are scarce.
Methods
HIV-infected adults in care between 1985–2014 at participating sites in the Latin America (the Caribbean, Central and South America network (CCASAnet)) and the Vanderbilt Comprehensive Care Clinic (VCCC) and who had CM were included. Survival probabilities were estimated. Risk of death when initiating ART within the first 2 weeks after CM diagnosis versus initiating between 2–8 weeks was assessed using dynamic marginal structural models adjusting for site, age, sex, year of CM, CD4 count, and route of HIV transmission.
Findings
340 patients were included (Argentina 58, Brazil 138, Chile 28, Honduras 27, Mexico 34, VCCC 55) and 142 (42%) died during the observation period. Among 151 patients with CM prior to ART 56 (37%) patients died compared to 86 (45%) of 189 with CM after ART initiation (p=0.14). Patients diagnosed with CM after ART had a higher risk of death (p=0.03, log-rank test). The probability of survival was not statistically different between patients who started ART within 2 weeks of CM (7/24, 29%) vs. those initiating between 2-8 weeks (14/53, 26%) (p=0.96), potentially due to lack of power.
Interpretation
In this large Latin-American cohort, patients with CM had very high mortality rates, especially those diagnosed after ART initiation. This study reflects the overwhelming burden of CM in HIV-infected patients in Latin America."

Medical tourism is increasingly popular for elective cosmetic surgical procedures. However, medical tourism has been accompanied by reports of post-surgical infections due to rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM). The authors’ experience working with patients with RGM infections who have returned to the USA after traveling abroad for cosmetic surgical procedures is described here.
Methods
Patients who developed RGM infections after undergoing cosmetic surgeries abroad and who presented at the Montefiore Medical Center (Bronx, New York, USA) between August 2015 and June 2016 were identified. A review of patient medical records was performed.
Results
Four patients who presented with culture-proven RGM infections at the sites of recent cosmetic procedures were identified. All patients were treated with a combination of antibiotics and aggressive surgical treatment.
Conclusions
This case series of RGM infections following recent cosmetic surgeries abroad highlights the risks of medical tourism. Close monitoring of affected patients by surgical and infectious disease specialties is necessary, as aggressive surgical debridement combined with appropriate antibiotic regimens is needed to achieve cure. Given the increasing reports of post-surgical RGM infections, consultants should have a low threshold for suspecting RGM, as rapid diagnosis may accelerate the initiation of targeted treatment and minimize morbidity."

Bronchoscopy can play a primary role in pulmonary TB diagnosis, particularly for suspected patients with scarce sputum or sputum smear negativity, and with endobronchial disease. Bronchoscopic needle aspiration techniques are accurate and safe means adopted to investigate hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes in cases of suspected TB lymphadenopathy. Tracheobronchial stenosis represents the worst complication of endobronchial tuberculosis. Bronchoscopic procedures are less invasive therapeutic strategies than conventional surgery to be adopted in the management of TB-related stenosis. We conducted a non-systematic review aimed at describing the scientific literature on the role of bronchoscopic techniques in the diagnosis and therapy of patients with TB. We focused on three main areas of interventions: bronchoscopic diagnosis of smear negative/sputum scarce TB patients, endobronchial TB diagnosis and treatment and needle aspiration techniques for intrathoracic TB lymphadenopathy. We described experiences on bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial washing, and biopsy techniques for the diagnosis of patients with tracheobronchial and pulmonary TB; furthermore, we described the role played by conventional and ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration in the diagnosis of suspected hilar and mediastinal TB adenopathy. Finally, we assessed the role of the bronchoscopic therapy in the treatment of endobronchial TB and its complications, focusing on dilation techniques (such as balloon dilation and airway stenting) and ablative procedures (both heat and cold therapies)."

abstract = "Background
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and HIV increase the risk of tuberculosis (TB). The frequency of DM among patients with TB with and without HIV is poorly documented in many low- and middle-income countries.
Methods
This was a cross-sectional hospital-based study performed in Abuja, Nigeria. Adults with presumptive TB were screened consecutively. Sputum culture was used for TB screening and blood was used for HIV screening, as well as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) assessment for the diagnosis of DM. HbA1c was measured using the D-10 Haemoglobin Testing System and a point-of-care test (A1C Now+ system) for comparison. Patients were classified as having DM or pre-diabetes using the D-10 reference test.
Results
Four hundred and ten individuals had TB culture, FPG, and HbA1c results. Participants had a mean (±standard deviation) age of 37.8±12.6 years and 217 (54.8%) were male. One hundred and thirteen (27.6%) patients were culture-positive, 62 (15.1%) had DM, and 46 (11.2%) had pre-diabetes. One hundred and eighty-four (53.3%) participants were HIV-positive and 95 (51.6%) were on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Patients with pre-diabetes and DM were more likely to have TB (odds ratio (OR) 1.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01–3.74, and OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.35–4.24, respectively). After adjustment for HIV, age, and sex, only DM was statistically associated with TB (adjusted OR (AOR) 3.10, 95% CI 1.62–5.94). HIV-negative patients with DM had a higher risk of TB (AOR 4.32, 95% CI 1.57–11.92) than HIV-positive patients with DM (AOR 3.31, 95% CI 1.29–8.54), but the difference was not statistically significant. A1C Now+ HbA1c measurements correlated poorly with the D-10 HbA1c reference test.
Conclusion
A high proportion of patients in Abuja have markers of DM and pre-diabetes at the time of TB diagnosis."

Background
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the introduction of moxifloxacin into the recommended regimen for tuberculosis (TB) treatment.
Methods
A meta-analysis was performed of nine eligible studies regarding the effect of moxifloxacin plus the recommended regimen compared to the recommended regimen alone for the treatment of TB.
Results
In the efficacy analysis, the overall odds ratio (OR) for sputum culture conversion was 1.895 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.355–2.651, p=0.000), indicating that when moxifloxacin is combined with the recommended regimen, the rate of sputum culture conversion is elevated compared to the recommended regimen alone. The overall OR for recurrence was 0.516 (95% CI 0.342–0.920, p=0.022), suggesting that the introduction of moxifloxacin into the recommended regimen reduces TB relapse after treatment. In the safety analysis, the overall OR was estimated to be 1.001 (95% CI 0.855–1.172, p=0.989), demonstrating that adding moxifloxacin to the recommended regimen does not cause more adverse events during TB treatment.
Conclusions
This meta-analysis suggests that the introduction of moxifloxacin into the recommended regimen for the treatment of non-drug resistant TB improves the clinical outcome by elevating the culture conversion rate and reducing the recurrence rate."

abstract = "Background
The public health impact of rotavirus vaccination in countries with high child mortality rates remains to be established. The RV1 rotavirus vaccine was introduced in Bolivia in August 2008. This study describes the trends in deaths, hospitalizations, and healthcare visits due to acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and in rotavirus-related hospitalizations, among children <5 years of age, during the pre- and post-vaccination periods.
Methods
Data were obtained from the National Health Information System to calculate vaccine coverage and AGE-related health indicators. Trend reductions in the main health indicators were examined using the pre-vaccine period as baseline. The effect of vaccination on the epidemiology of rotavirus-related AGE was assessed using data from the active surveillance hospitals.
Results
Compared with the 2001–2008 pre-vaccine baseline, the mean number of rotavirus-related hospitalizations was reduced by 40.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 21.7–66.4%) among children <5years of age in the post-vaccine period (2009–2013). Reductions were most pronounced in children <1year of age, eligible for vaccination. The mean proportions of AGE-related deaths, AGE-related hospitalizations, and AGE-related healthcare visits during 2009–2014 were reduced by 52.5% (95% CI 47.4–56.3), 30.2% (95% CI 23.5–36.1), and 12.9% (95% CI 12.0–13.2), respectively. The greatest effect in reduction of AGE-related deaths was found during the months with seasonal peaks of rotavirus disease. Over the post-vaccine period, changes in rotavirus epidemiology were observed, manifested by variations in seasonality and by a shift in the mean age of those with rotavirus infection.
Conclusions
The significant decrease in main AGE-related health indicators in children <5years of age after the introduction of rotavirus vaccine provides evidence of a substantial public health impact of rotavirus vaccination in Bolivia, as a measure for protecting children against AGE."

Objective
The aim of this study was to compare laboratory surveillance with the notifiable diseases surveillance system (NDSS) in South Africa.
Methods
Data on three tracer notifiable diseases – measles, meningococcal meningitis, and typhoid – were compared to assess data quality, stability, representativeness, sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV), using the Wilcoxon and Chi-square tests, at the 5% significance level.
Results
For all three diseases, fewer cases were notified than confirmed in the laboratory. Completeness for the laboratory system was higher for measles (63% vs. 47%, p<0.001) and meningococcal meningitis (63% vs. 57%, p<0.001), but not for typhoid (60% vs. 63%, p=0.082). Stability was higher for the laboratory (all 100%) compared to notified measles (24%, p<0.001), meningococcal meningitis (74%, p<0.001), and typhoid (36%, p<0.001). Representativeness was also higher for the laboratory (all 100%) than for notified measles (67%, p=0.058), meningococcal meningitis (56%, p=0.023), and typhoid (44%, p=0.009). The sensitivity of the NDSS was 50%, 98%, and 93%, and the PPV was 20%, 57%, and 81% for measles, meningococcal meningitis, and typhoid, respectively.
Conclusions
Compared to laboratory surveillance, the NDSS performed poorly on most system attributes. Revitalization of the NDSS in South Africa is recommended to address the completeness, stability, and representativeness of the system."

abstract = "Background
Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS), caused by the hantavirus, is a natural infectious disease characterized by fever, hemorrhage and renal damage. China is the most severely endemic area for HFRS in the world. In recent years, critical scoring systems based on quantitative classification have become an important clinical tool for predicting and evaluating the prognosis of critical illness, and provide guidelines for clinical practice.
Methods
The sample comprised 384 patients with HFRS treated in the Taizhou Hospital from January 2006 to February 2017. The patients were divided into the severe group and the mild group according to their clinical characteristics. By comparing the differences in clinical symptoms, signs and laboratory data between the two groups, the clinically relevant indicators of severe HFRS were explored. According to the previous studies, we incorporated the positive fecal occult blood test (FOBT) into the sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA) tool and formulated a new scoring system specifically for HFRS, named H-SOFA. By comparing the simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II), SOFA and H-SOFA scores of the two groups, their predictive values for the progression of HFRS were assessed.
Results
Compared to the mild group, patients in the severe group had longer hospital stays; higher frequencies of nausea, vomiting, abdomen pain, signs of congestion and hemorrhage; and more pronounced impairment of liver and renal function. The levels of PLT, PCT, TB, and FOBT were positively correlated with the progression of HFRS (P<0.001). Patients with HFRS in the severe group got significantly higher scores on the SAPS II, SOFA, and H-SOFA scoring systems (P<0.001). The values of SAPS II, SOFA and H-SOFA, were significantly correlated with the severity of HFRS, and the AUC values were 0.90, 0.96, and 0.98, respectively.
Conclusion
PLT, PCT, TB, and FOBT were independent predictors of severe HFRS; SAPS II, SOFA, and H-SOFA had high predictive value for the progression of severe HFRS, with H-SOFA being the highest."

Universal prophylaxis and preemptive therapy are used to prevent cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease post-transplantation. Data regarding which strategy is superior are sparse, especially in high-risk recipients (donor CMV seropositive (D+) and recipient CMV seronegative (R−)).
Methods
This retrospective, single-center cohort study included recipients who underwent kidney transplantation between 2009 and 2015. The incidence of CMV infection/disease and patient and graft outcomes were analyzed and compared between high-risk recipients (D+/R−) and intermediate-risk recipients (D+/R+ or D−/R+), all managed with preemptive therapy.
Results
Of 118 kidney transplant recipients, 21 were high-risk and 97 were intermediate-risk. Over a median follow-up period of 3 years, asymptomatic CMV infection developed significantly more frequently in high-risk patients than in intermediate-risk patients (38.1% vs. 16.5%, p=0.04), and CMV disease developed in a similar manner (28.6% vs. 3.1%, p<0.01). Among high-risk patients, CMV infection developed within the first 3 months post-transplantation and CMV disease within the first 9 months post-transplantation. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed no difference in the probability of mortality (log-rank p=0.63) or graft loss (log-rank p=0.50) between the patient groups. Graft rejection occurred more frequently in high-risk than in intermediate-risk patients, but the difference was not significant (log-rank p=0.24).
Conclusions
These results suggest that further studies on universal prophylaxis in high-risk patients are needed to elucidate whether preventing CMV infection/disease during the early post-transplant period leads to better outcomes, especially in terms of reducing graft rejection."

Leptospirosis is one of the most widespread zoonoses in the world and is caused by spirochetes of the genus Leptospira. In Mozambique, the disease is largely ignored and its epidemiology is unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence of leptospirosis in febrile patients.
Methods
This cross-sectional study was performed between July 2012 and September 2015 among febrile patients. A total of 373 paired serum samples were drawn from febrile patients; 208 were from Caia District Hospital (rural setting) in Sofala Province and 165 were from Polana Caniço General Hospital (suburban setting) in Maputo City. Samples were initially screened using an in-house ELISA for IgM and IgG antibodies. Double positive samples were confirmed using a microagglutination test (MAT).
Results
Of the 373 febrile patients, five (1.3%) had acute leptospirosis (MAT ≥400) and 38 (10.2%) had a presumptive infection (IgM-positive/MAT <400). While most of the patients with a presumptive infection lived in the rural setting (84.2%, 32/38), the majority of patients with acute infections (60%, 3/5) and with negative results (60.3%, 199/330) lived in the suburban setting (p=0.000). Contact with rodents was significantly higher in patient with acute leptospirosis (100%, 5/5) than in those with a presumptive infection (39.5%, 15/38) or negative results (41.8%, 138/330) (p=0.031). Four out of the five patients (80%) with acute leptospirosis were treated with antimalarial drugs although malaria results were negative. The prevailing serogroup, according to MAT results, was Australis (40%; 4/10), followed by Icterohaemorrhagiae (30%, 3/10).
Conclusions
This study found that leptospirosis is prevalent among Mozambicans, and most cases are misdiagnosed as malaria."

Direct-acting antiviral (DAA)-based treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been associated with high sustained virological response (SVR) rates and good tolerability in randomized clinical trials. This study was performed to assess the safety and effectiveness of DAAs in both HCV mono-infected and HIV/HCV co-infected patients.
Methods
All consecutive HCV-infected patients, including HIV/HCV co-infected patients, receiving DAA-based treatment from February 2015 to September 2016 at the study clinic were included. Clinical, virological, and biochemical data were retrieved. The primary end-point was the SVR12 (HCV RNA undetectable 12 weeks after the end of treatment) is commonly used worldwide. The secondary end-point was the safety profile of DAAs during the treatment period.
Results
A total of 382 patients were included; 62 were HIV/HCV co-infected. Cirrhosis was found in 256 patients (67.4%). SVR12 was achieved in 365/382 (95.5%) individuals (58/62 HIV/HCV co-infected, 93.5%) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. A platelet count <90×109/l (odds ratio (OR) 4.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5–11.3, p=0.006), HCV genotype 3 infection (OR 5.49, 95% CI 1.9–15.7, p=0.002), liver stiffness >20kPa (OR 3.05, 95% CI 1.03–8.96, p=0.04), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score >10 (OR 5.27, 95% CI 1.16–23.8, p=0.03) were associated with lower SVR rates. On multivariate analysis, only genotype 3 infection remained a negative predictor of SVR (OR 21.6, 95% CI 3.81–123, p=0.001). Treatment discontinuation was observed in 10 subjects. Severe adverse events (SAEs) occurred in 17 patients (4.5%).
Conclusions
High SVR12 rates were observed in both HCV mono-infected and HIV/HCV co-infected individuals. Overall, DAA-based treatment was safe and there were no differences in terms of SAEs and treatment discontinuation between the two groups."

Objective
Thyroid hormone (TH) has been suggested to control herpes virus gene expression and replication in neurons via epigenetics through its nuclear receptors. It has previously been shown that patients with hypothyroidism are predisposed to herpes zoster (HZ), suggesting that the TH deficiency may be a risk factor for varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that TH treatment will ameliorate the complication of HZ.
Methods
This study investigated the hypothesis by enquiring into a comprehensive medical database at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) to verify whether patients taking TH medication experience a reduction in HZ occurrence.
Results
It was shown by Kaplan–Meier analysis that hypothyroidism patients taking TH medicines had a lower risk of HZ. The fully adjusted analysis indicated that patients receiving medication for the treatment of TH deficiency exhibited a reduced risk of HZ (hazard ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.51–0.71). This lower risk of HZ was significant in all age groups except the 18–39 years cohort. In addition, female patients taking TH treatment exhibited a lower risk than their male counterparts.
Conclusions
Together these findings support the hypothesis that a constant level of TH will provide a degree of protection from contracting HZ. More studies are underway to evaluate the laboratory data for an analysis of hormonal effects on individuals."

The impact of pediatric antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASP) on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) remains largely unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the AMR for carbapenem of Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) and carbapenem use with infectious diseases consultation after the implementation of an ASP.
Methods
This quasi-experimental study was conducted at Tokyo Metropolitan Children’s Medical Center in Japan. The pre- and post-intervention periods were April 2010 to September 2011 and October 2011 to March 2017, respectively. The pre-intervention phase consisted of consultations with the infectious diseases service alone. The ASP was implemented during the post-intervention phase. The carbapenem resistance rates of GNB were calculated. The correlation between carbapenem resistance rates and carbapenem day of therapy (DOT) was examined. The outcome metrics were compared by average length of hospitalization, all-cause mortality, and infection-related mortality.
Results
A positive correlation was observed between the carbapenem resistance rate in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and DOT (0.76, p=0.04). The carbapenem resistance rate in P. aeruginosa (p<0.01) and DOT (p<0.01) decreased significantly in the post-intervention period. The length of hospitalization (p<0.01) and infection-related mortality (p=0.05) decreased in the post-intervention period.
Conclusions
A sustained ASP with additional consultation with the infectious disease service reduced carbapenem use and resistance in P. aeruginosa, leading to favorable outcomes in terms of length of hospitalization and infection-related mortality."

North American indigenous populations experience a high burden of invasive bacterial infections. Because Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae have multiple antigenic variants, the existing vaccines cannot prevent all cases. This study addresses the current epidemiology of invasive H. influenzae and pneumococcal disease (IPD) in a region of Northwestern Ontario, Canada with a relatively high (82%) indigenous population.
Methods
Data were retrieved from a retrospective chart review at a hospital servicing a population of 29000 (82% indigenous), during January 2010–July 2015.
Results
Ten cases of invasive H. influenzae disease and 37 cases of IPD were identified. The incidence of both in the study population (6.3 and 23.1/100000/year, respectively) exceeded national rates (1.6 and 9.0/100000/year). H. influenzae serotype a (Hia) was the most common (50%), followed by non-typeable H. influenzae (20%). In adults, 77% of IPD cases were caused by serotypes included in the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. All paediatric IPD cases were caused by serotypes not included in the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. The case-fatality rate was 10% for invasive H. influenzae and 2.7% for IPD. Most cases exhibited substantial co-morbidity.
Conclusions
In Northwestern Ontario, the incidence of invasive Hia disease exceeds that of H. influenzae type b (Hib) in the pre-Hib vaccine era. This provides strong support for the development of a new Hia vaccine. Improved pneumococcal vaccination of high-risk adults in the region is warranted."

Objectives
The differentiation between Mycobacterium abscessus subspecies abscessus (M. abscessus) and Mycobacterium abscessus subspecies massiliense (M. massiliense) and determination of the presence of inducible resistance to macrolide antibiotics are important factors in the management of patients with Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABC) infections. Unlike pulmonary MABC infections, little information on extrapulmonary MABC infections is available.
Methods
The molecular identification of clinical isolates was performed, and the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of 20 consecutive patients with extrapulmonary MABC infections were assessed.
Results
M. abscessus and M. massiliense each caused 10 (50%) of the cases. Eight (80%) M. abscessus isolates that had inducible resistance to clarithromycin harbored an intact erm(41) gene of the T28 variant, whereas two (20%) M. abscessus isolates had the C28 erm(41) variant and were susceptible to clarithromycin. All M. massiliense isolates had a truncated erm(41) gene and were susceptible to clarithromycin. The drug susceptibility profiles other than clarithromycin were similar for the M. abscessus and M. massiliense isolates. Of the 20 patients, 17 (85%) showed a favorable outcome, including all patients with M. massiliense infection and 70% (7/10) of patients with M. abscessus infection. Favorable outcomes were associated with M. massiliense and M. abscessus isolates with a non-functional erm(41) gene (p=0.049).
Conclusions
Precise species and subspecies identification and the determination of macrolide susceptibility are recommended for the optimal treatment of extrapulmonary MABC infections."

The occurrence of hantavirus in Sub-Saharan Africa is poorly studied and its clinical implications are unknown. This study aimed to determine the occurrence of hantavirus infection among febrile patients attending an outpatient clinic at a primary health care center located in a suburban area of the city of Maputo in Mozambique.
Methods
Paired acute and convalescent samples from a total of 200 febrile patients aged >5years who were recruited between February 2012 and October 2014 were screened for IgM and IgG antibodies against hantavirus using an ELISA. Acute samples were also screened for malaria and to determine hematological and clinical chemistry parameters.
Results
Of the 200 patients enrolled, four had IgM antibodies in their acute sample and IgG antibodies in their convalescent sample, yielding a prevalence rate of 2%. Contact with rodents was higher among IgM-positive participants than IgM-negative participants (50.0% (2/4) vs. 15.3% (30/196)). IgM-positive patients presented significantly higher levels of creatinine and alanine aminotransferase and lower platelet counts than IgM-negative patients.

Heteroresistance is a phenomenon in which there are various responses to antibiotics from bacterial cells within the same population. Here, we isolated and characterised an imipenem heteroresistant Acinetobacter baumannii strain (HRAB-85).
Methods
The genome of strain HRAB-85 was completely sequenced and analysed to understand its antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Population analysis and multilocus sequence typing were performed.
Results
Subpopulations grew in the presence of imipenem at concentrations of up to 64μg/mL, and the strain was found to belong to ST208. The total length of strain HRAB-85 was 4,098,585bp with a GC content of 39.98%. The genome harboured at least four insertion sequences: the common ISAba1, ISAba22, ISAba24, and newly reported ISAba26. Additionally, 19 antibiotic-resistance genes against eight classes of antimicrobial agents were found, and 11 genomic islands (GIs) were identified. Among them, GI3, GI10, and GI11 contained many ISs and antibiotic-resistance determinants.
Conclusions
The existence of imipenem heteroresistant phenotypes in A. baumannii was substantiated in this hospital, and imipenem pressure, which could induce imipenem-heteroresistant subpopulations, may select for highly resistant strains. The complete genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis of HRAB-85 could improve our understanding of the epidemiology and resistance mechanisms of carbapenem-heteroresistant A. baumannii."

This study developed and validated a non-invasive scoring model to predict 1-year hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion in response to nucleos(t)ide analog (NA) treatment in NA-naïve patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB).
Methods
Baseline data from 1014 patients visiting the outpatient and inpatient clinics of Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, China between October 2008 and April 2015 were included. These patients received NAs for HBeAg-positive CHB. The patients were assigned randomly to the derivation (n=710) and validation (n=304) cohorts in a 7:3 ratio. A prediction scoring model was established based on univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses to identify independent prediction factors. In the derivation cohort, the odds ratio of the predictors were converted to integer risk scores by rounding the quotient from dividing the odds ratio, and the final score was the sum of these values. The predictive accuracy of the scoring model was further assessed using Harrell’s concordance index (C-index).
Results
The 1-year cumulative HBeAg seroconversion rates were 11.83% and 8.55% in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. In the derivation cohort, baseline pretreatment alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), globulin (GLO), and quantitative HBeAg (qHBeAg) levels were independently associated with HBeAg seroconversion and were included in the scoring system. The model had good discrimination in the derivation and validation cohorts (C-index=0.750, 95% confidence interval 0.694–0.806 and C-index=0.776, 95% confidence interval 0.698–0.855, respectively). The prediction scores ranged from 0 to 4; scores of 0–1 and 2–4 identified patients with lower and higher levels of HBeAg seroconversion, respectively. Kaplan–Meier analysis was used to determine the 1-year cumulative HBeAg seroconversion rates in the two groups (scores of 0–1 and 2–4) of the primary cohort, and log-rank tests revealed a significant difference (4.87% vs. 20.9%, p<0.0001).
Conclusions
The 1-year prediction scoring model based on baseline levels of ALT, GGT, GLO, and qHBeAg offered a reliable predictive value for the response to NA therapy in a Chinese cohort."

Results
We included 87 hip or knee PJI episodes in 87 patients from three university hospitals in France and Switzerland. All debridements were performed within 3 weeks of symptom onset. After a mean follow-up of 52.1 months, 60 patients with PJI (69%) remained in remission, with no significant difference between hip and knee cases (73.3% vs. 59.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.20–1.38), or between patients receiving 6 compared with 12 weeks of antibiotic treatment (70.5% vs.67.4%, 95%CI 0.27–2.10, p=0.60).

Conclusions
In patients undergoing DAIR for hip or knee PJI, the likelihood of long-term remission was not significantly different for those receiving 6 versus 12 weeks of antibiotic therapy. Prospective randomized trials are required to confirm this observation."

Little is known about neonatal Staphylococcus aureus carriage. Sites and clinical outcomes of S. aureus colonization during the first month of life were evaluated in this study.
Methods
A cohort of 279 infants born at term to 277 mothers was included. Maternal S. aureus colonization status was examined before labor. Newborns were screened for nasal, auricular, umbilical, and rectal colonization, one to three times within 100h after birth, and infants of carrier mothers were re-screened at 1 month. Medical data were recorded from the medical charts at discharge and at the 1-month follow-up interview.
Results
Overall 43 out of 279 (15.4%) infants acquired S. aureus within the first days of life. The only two predictors of S. aureus carriage in the postnatal period were maternal S. aureus carriage (odds ratio 7.905, 95% confidence interval 3.182–19.638) and maternal antibiotic treatment during labor (odds ratio 0.121, 95% confidence interval 0.016–0.949). Among colonized children, the nose (56%) and rectum (40%) were more frequently colonized, while ear (26%) and umbilicus (16%) colonization were less common. Co-colonization at two sites was rare (4%), but always predicted carriage at 1 month of age. Maternal and neonatal characteristics, including neonatal outcomes, were similar between S. aureus carrier and non-carrier infants during the first month of life.
Conclusions
Maternal carriage is the major predictor of neonatal S. aureus carriage. The nose and rectum are the main sites of neonatal carriage. S. aureus carriage was not associated with neonatal complications throughout the first month of life. The long-term significance of early S. aureus carriage is yet to be determined."

To describe the clinical characteristics, outcomes, and factors associated with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) due to ribotype 027 (RT027) and recurrence, including an outbreak period, with transition to endemicity.
Methods
A case–control study was performed. Clinical and demographic data were collected for patients with CDI during the period January 2008 to December 2015. Ribotyping of the isolates and PCR for toxin A, B, and binary were performed.
Results
Among 324 episodes of CDI, 27.7% were caused by RT027. Previous fluoroquinolone use (odds ratio (OR) 1.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01–3.17), previous gastrointestinal endoscopy (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.29–3.65), chemotherapy (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.19–0.95), and total enteral nutrition (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.18–0.97) were associated with RT027.

Among the non-RT027, 59.8% were not assigned by the ribotyping database and 50.7% presented binary toxin.
Conclusions
In this population, CDI due to the RT027 strain was not associated with poorer outcomes. This study reinforces the importance of avoiding fluoroquinolones and PPIs to prevent recurrences. The presence of virulence factors among non-RT027 C. difficile strains underscores the importance of performing molecular epidemiology surveillance."

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) share similar routes of transmission, and rapid progression of hepatic and immunodeficiency diseases has been observed in coinfected individuals. Our main objective was to investigate the molecular mechanism of HIV/HBV coinfections.
Methods
We selected HIV infected and HIV/HBV coinfected patients with and without Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART). Low abundance proteins enriched using a multiple affinity removal system (MARS) were labeled with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) kits and analyzed using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS). The differential proteins were analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO) database.
Results
A total of 41 differential proteins were found in HIV/HBV coinfected patients as compared to HIV mono-infected patients with or without HAART treatment, including 7 common HBV-regulated proteins. The proteins involved in complement and coagulation pathways were significantly enriched, including plasma kallikrein (KLK) and complement component C9 (C9). C9 and KLK were verified to be down-regulated in HIV/HBV coinfected patients through ELISA analysis.
Conclusion
The present iTRAQ based proteomic analyses identified 7 proteins that are related to HIV/HBV coinfection. HBV might influence hepatic and immune functions by deregulating complement and coagulation pathways. C9 and KLK could potentially be used as targets for the treatment of HIV/HBV coinfections."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of soft tissue infections. It is unknown, however, if a patient who has had such an infection is at greater risk for future soft tissue infections with S. aureus.
Methods
We conducted an epidemiological survey of adult patients hospitalized in the only public hospital in Geneva for treatment (usually combined surgical and medical) of a soft tissue infection caused by S. aureus. By reviewing nursing and medical records from the emergency department and hospital wards, we assessed whether or not they developed any other soft tissue infections (excluding a recurrence) after or before the index one.
Results
Among 1023 index episodes of soft tissue infections, 670 (65%) were caused by S. aureus, of which 47 were caused by methicillin-resistant strains (30 healthcare-associated and 17 community-acquired). The patients’ median age was 51 years and 334 (34%) were immune-compromised. The median time span between the patient’s first and last consultation (for any reason) in our hospital was 21.4 years (interquartile range, 10-30 years). In addition to their index infection, 124 patients (12%) developed a new nosocomial or community-acquired soft tissue infection. Among the index cases with an S. aureus infection, 92 (14%) had another soft tissue infection, compared to 32 (9%) who had a non-staphylococcal index infection (Pearson-χ2-test; p=0.03). Similarly, patients with an index S. aureus infection, compared to those with a non-S. aureus infection, had a higher rate of another soft tissue infection caused by S. aureus (χ2-test; p<0.01). In multivariate analysis, an index infection due to S. aureus shows a high association to further S. aureus soft tissue infections (logistic regression; odds ratio 2.5, 95% confidence interval 1.4-4.6).
Conclusion
Among adult patients hospitalised for a soft tissue infection, those infected with S. aureus (compared with other pathogens) may be at higher risk of a subsequent soft tissue infection, particularly with S. aureus."

abstract = "Introduction
During recent decades, the rates of multidrug resistance, including resistance to carbapenems, have increased dramatically among Acinetobacter species. Tigecycline has activity against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter spp, including carbapenem-resistant isolates. However, reports of tigecycline-resistant Acinetobacter spp are emerging from different parts of the world. The purpose of this study was to evaluate potential risk factors associated with tigecycline non-susceptible Acinetobacter bacteremia.
Methods
The medical records of 152 patients with Acinetobacter bacteremia attending Samsung Medical Center between January 2010 and December 2014 were reviewed. Non-susceptibility to tigecycline was defined as a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of tigecycline ≥4μg/ml. Cases were patients with tigecycline non-susceptible Acinetobacter bacteremia and controls were those with tigecycline-susceptible Acinetobacter bacteremia.
Results
Of the 152 patients included in the study, 61 (40.1%) had tigecycline non-susceptible Acinetobacter bacteremia (case group). These patients were compared to 91 patients with tigecycline-susceptible Acinetobacter bacteremia (control group). The case group showed high resistance to other antibiotics (>90%) except colistin (6.6%) and minocycline (9.8%) when compared to the control group, which exhibited relatively low resistance to other antibiotics (<50%). Multivariate analysis showed that recent exposure to corticosteroids (minimum 20mg per day for more than 5 days within 2 weeks) (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.887, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.170–7.126) and carbapenems (within 2 weeks) (adjusted OR 4.437, 95% CI 1.970–9.991) were significantly associated with tigecycline non-susceptible Acinetobacter bacteremia. Although prior exposure to tigecycline was more common in the case group than in the control group (9.8%, 6/61 vs. 2.2%, 2/91; p=0.046), this variable was found not to be a significant factor associated with tigecycline non-susceptibility after adjustment for other variables (adjusted OR 1.884, 95% CI 0.298–11.920; p=0.501).
Conclusions
These data suggest that tigecycline non-susceptible Acinetobacter spp have emerged and disseminated in the hospital in association with a recent exposure to carbapenems and an immunosuppressed state. This indicates that the rational use of antibiotics through a comprehensive antimicrobial stewardship program, especially in immunosuppressed patients, may be essential in limiting the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant organisms such as tigecycline-resistant Acinetobacter spp, which are difficult to treat."

Objective
To examine the variability and safety of serum trough concentrations of vancomycin in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and to analyze the factors influencing the trough concentration.
Methods
Data were collected retrospectively from ICU patients receiving vancomycin treatment at a fixed dose of 2g/day due to unobtainable weight data, at Changzhou No. 2 People’s Hospital, between 2012 and 2015. Vancomycin trough concentrations were compared between groups stratified by sex, age, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
Results
The vancomycin trough concentration varied significantly among ICU patients on a fixed dose of 2g/day. Only 16.9% of ICU patients met the concentration target of 15–20mg/l, while 25% of patients showed supratherapeutic concentrations. A higher proportion of female patients than male patients showed supratherapeutic concentrations (40.4% vs. 15.5%). The trough concentration was positively correlated with age (y=0.279x−2.085; R2=0.186) and negatively correlated with eGFR (y=−0.2x+33.776; R2=0.366). Vancomycin-related nephrotoxicity occurred at an incidence of 5.9%.
Conclusions
These results suggest that the fixed-dose regimen is not appropriate for ICU patients in view of the low incidence of target trough concentrations and the high incidence of supratherapeutic concentrations. The dose should be individualized based on weight, age, and renal function to improve outcomes and patient safety."

The Philippines has one of the fastest-growing HIV epidemics in the world. Possible reasons for this include increased testing, increased local transmission, and possibly more aggressive strains of HIV. This study sought to determine whether local molecular subtypes of HIV have changed.
Methods
Viruses from 81 newly diagnosed, treatment-naive HIV patients were genotyped using protease and reverse transcriptase genes. Demographic characteristics and CD4 count data were collected.
Results
The cohort had an average age of 29 years (range 19–51 years), CD4+ count of 255 cells/mm3 (range 2–744 cells/mm3), and self-reported acquisition time of 2.42 years (range 0.17–8.17 years). All were male, including 79 men who have sex with men (MSM). The genotype distribution was 77% CRF01_AE, 22% B, and 1% C. Previous data from 1985–2000 showed that most Philippine HIV infections were caused by subtype B (71%, n=100), followed by subtype CRF01_AE (20%). Comparison with the present cohort showed a significant shift in subtype (p<0.0001). Comparison between CRF01_AE and B showed a lower CD4+ count (230 vs. 350 cells/mm3, p=0.03). Survival data showed highly significant survival associated with antiretroviral (ARV) treatment (p<0.0001), but no significant difference in mortality or CD4 count increase on ARVs between subtypes.
Conclusions
The molecular epidemiology of HIV in the Philippines has changed, with the more aggressive CRF01_AE now being the predominant subtype."

The impact of antimicrobial therapy on the outcomes of patients with colonized catheters and no bacteraemia has not been assessed. This study assessed whether targeted antibiotic therapy is related to a poor outcome in patients with positive cultures of blood drawn through a non-tunnelled central venous catheter (CVC) and without concomitant bacteraemia.
Methods
This was a retrospective study involving adult patients with positive blood cultures drawn through a CVC and negative peripheral vein blood cultures. Patients were classified into two groups: those with clinical improvement and those with a poor outcome. These two groups were compared. The outcome was considered poor in the presence of one or more of the following: death, bacteraemia or other infection due to the same microorganism, and evidence of catheter-related bloodstream infection.
Results
A total of 100 patients were included (31 with a poor outcome). The only independent predictors of a poor outcome were a McCabe and Jackson score of 1–2 and a median APACHE score of 5. No association was found between the use of targeted antimicrobial therapy and a poor outcome when its effect was adjusted for the rest of the variables.
Conclusions
This study showed that antimicrobial therapy was not associated with a poor outcome in non-bacteraemic patients with positive blood cultures drawn through a CVC."

Objective
To detect the prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) in the lymph nodes of slaughtered cattle collected from selected abattoirs in Eastern Cape Province of South Africa.
Methods
A total of 376 lymph nodes were collected from slaughtered cattle over a period of 12 months. Certain characteristics (sex, age, body condition score, and breed) were observed to be associated with MTBC among slaughtered cattle. Collected samples were cultured and tested for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). DNA was isolated, purified, and quantified using a spectrophotometer. Quantified DNA was confirmed to be MTBC by multiplex PCR targeting two genes (IS6110 and mpb64).
Results
Of the 376 collected lymph nodes, 182 were positive when tested by Ziehl–Neelsen stain and 162 were confirmed positive for MTBC by PCR. MTBC was isolated from lymph nodes with nodular lesions (72.8%, 118/162) and inflamed lymph nodes (27.1%, 44/162). All detected MTBC isolates were positive for region of deletion 1 (RD1). No isolate was detected to have Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG). However, 3.1% had M. bovis and 96.9% had M. tuberculosis.
Conclusions
The presence of live Mycobacterium strains in slaughtered cattle poses a health risk to beef consumers and abattoir workers."

New diagnostic innovations for tuberculosis (TB), including point-of-care solutions, are critical to reach the goals of the End TB Strategy. However, despite decades of research, numerous reports on new biomarker candidates, and significant investment, no well-performing, simple and rapid TB diagnostic test is yet available on the market, and the search for accurate, non-DNA biomarkers remains a priority. To help overcome this ‘biomarker pipeline problem’, FIND and partners are working on the development of a well-curated and user-friendly TB biomarker database. The web-based database will enable the dynamic tracking of evidence surrounding biomarker candidates in relation to target product profiles (TPPs) for needed TB diagnostics. It will be able to accommodate raw datasets and facilitate the verification of promising biomarker candidates and the identification of novel biomarker combinations. As such, the database will simplify data and knowledge sharing, empower collaboration, help in the coordination of efforts and allocation of resources, streamline the verification and validation of biomarker candidates, and ultimately lead to an accelerated translation into clinically useful tools."

To investigate fluoroquinolone resistance and associated mechanisms of Shigella sonnei isolates in Jiangsu Province of China between 2002 and 2011.
Methods
All 337 unduplicated S. sonnei isolates were collected from hospitals in Jiangsu Province from January 2002 to December 2011. Fluoroquinolone susceptibility was characterized by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method, and direct nucleotide sequencing of genes of the quinolone resistance determining regions were conducted. Also, the transferable quinolone resistance determinants, including qnrA, qnrB, qnrC, qnrD, qnrS, aac-(6′)-Ib-cr and qepA were amplified by PCR.
Results
Among 950 Shigella isolates, 337 (35.5%) were identified as S. sonnei, of which 76.6% displayed nalidixic acid resistance and norfloxacin-resistant isolates appeared in 2005-2009, with an average resistance rate of 21.8%. Commonly reported point mutations of Ser83Leu and Asp87Asn/Gly in gyrA and Ser80Ile in parC were detected, with mutation rates of 78.0%, 9.5% and 30.3%, respectively, while no alteration in gyrB or parE were detected. Besides, His211Tyr mutation in gyrA was first reported in a S. sonnei strain in 2009 and two novel mutations in parC were found, of which Met86Trp occurred in another strain in 2009 and Ser129Pro appeared every year except 2011 (28.8%). Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants were found in 23 isolates and 19 of these isolates were resistant to both nalidixic acid and norfloxacin. qnrB, qnrS, aac-(6′)-Ib-cr and qepA were detected in 1, 7, 14 and 2 S. sonnei strains, relatively, and the most abundant PMQR gene found in this work was aac-(6′)-Ib-cr (4.2%).
Interpretation & conclusions
S. sonnei became increasingly important as fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates emerged, and further detection on the resistant genes would be useful in the treatment and control of this infection."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro effects and clinical efficacies of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT) combined with other antimicrobial agents against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.
Methods
In vitro analysis was conducted on 89 S. maltophilia strains isolated from blood and the respiratory tract between June 2012 and October 2014. Levofloxacin (LVX), ticarcillin-clavulanic acid (TIM), and minocycline (MIN) were selected for an examination of their effects when individually combined with SXT by the checkerboard method. In addition, 29 S. maltophilia bacteremia cases were reviewed and the clinical efficacies of SXT-based combination therapies were analyzed.
Results
SXT+LVX showed synergy in 21, no interactions in 61, and antagonism in 7. SXT+TIM showed synergy in 71, and no interactions in 18. SXT+MIN showed synergy in 10, and no interactions in 79. The review of clinical data indicated that a combination of SXT+fluoroquinolone was not associated with improved prognosis compared with monotherapy.
Conclusions
The in vitro data indicated that SXT+TIM had beneficial microbiological effects and was not antagonistic. Our in vitro and clinical data analyses do not support the routine use of SXT+fluoroquinolone combination therapy for S. maltophilia infection."

Despite the availability of anti-HBV therapies, HBV infection remains a major global public health problem. Developing an ideal animal model of HBV infection to clarify the details of the HBV replication process, the viral life cycle, the resulting immunoresponse and the precise pathogenesis of HBV is difficult because HBV has an extremely narrow host range and almost exclusively infects humans. In this review, we summarize and evaluate animal models available for studying HBV infection, especially focusing on humanized chimeric mouse models, and we discuss future development trends regarding immunocompetent humanized mouse models that can delineate the natural history and immunopathophysiology of HBV infection."

Drug susceptibility testing (DST) for second-line drugs is recommended for these patients, but logistical difficulties have impeded widespread implementation of second-line DST in many settings. To provide a quantitative perspective on the decision to scale up second-line DST, we synthesize literature on the prevalence of second-line drug resistance, the expected clinical and epidemiologic benefits of using second-line DST to ensure that patients with rifampin-resistant TB receive effective regimens, and the costs of implementing (or not implementing) second-line DST for all individuals diagnosed with rifampin-resistant TB. We conclude that, in most settings, second-line DST could substantially improve treatment outcomes for patients with rifampin-resistant TB, reduce transmission of drug-resistant TB, prevent amplification of drug resistance, and be affordable or even cost-saving. Given the large investment made in each patient treated for rifampin-resistant TB, these payoffs would come at relatively small incremental cost. These anticipated benefits likely justify addressing the real challenges faced in implementing second-line DST in most high-burden settings."

Studies show that the time of effective treatment is the key parameter to follow to determine if patients are contagious to others or not. This means that standard treatment of multi-drug resistant, MDR, TB will not result in the patient being non-infectious. Thus it is important right from the time of diagnosis to know if the patient is infected with MDR TB or not. Thus the early use of molecular techniques to reveal drug susceptibility is important.

Objectives
No consensus currently exists on the indications for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis in patients with inflammatory or autoimmune diseases. The main objective was to identify biomarkers associated with P. jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) in this population.
Methods
A retrospective study was carried out at Beijing Union Medical College Hospital (2003–2014). All patients with an inflammatory or autoimmune disease presenting with acute onset of fever and respiratory symptoms were included.
Results
A total of 123 patients were included, of whom 42% had confirmed PCP, 18% had possible PCP, and 40% were negative for PCP. Immunosuppressive conditions consisted mostly of diffuse connective tissue disease (50%) and primary nephropathy (20%). Immunosuppressive therapies consisted of corticosteroids (95%) with concomitant non-steroidal drugs (80%). Independent predictors of PCP were a CD3+ cell count <625×106/l, serum albumin <28g/l, and PaO2/FiO2 <210. Furthermore, 90% of patients with PCP had a CD3+ cell count <750×106/l. Independent predictors of mortality were a CD8+ cell count <160×106/l and a PaO2/FiO2 <160.
Conclusions
In patients with inflammatory and autoimmune conditions receiving immunosuppressive therapy, low CD3+ and CD8+ cell counts were strongly associated with PCP and its mortality. These results suggest that lymphocyte subtyping is a very useful tool to optimize the selection of patients needing prophylaxis."

To determine the frequency of human papillomavirus (HPV) types and behavioral characteristics related to cytological abnormalities in women descendants of slaves, who live in isolated communities known as quilombos in the state of Maranhão, Brazil.
Methods
Cervicovaginal specimens of 353 women were analyzed by conventional cytology and genotyping. HPV detection and genotyping was performed using a linear array HPV genotyping test kit. Behavioral factors and their association with cytological abnormalities were analyzed, as well as the association between cytological abnormalities and HPV infection.
Results
The frequency of HPV infection was 13%, and infection with high-risk HPV types was more frequent than with low-risk types (10.2% vs. 2.8%). The most prevalent genotypes were HPV 68 (3.1%) and HPV 58 (2.6%). HPV-positive women were 6.5 times more likely than HPV-negative women to be diagnosed with cytological abnormalities. There was a significant association between HPV infection and the presence of cytological abnormalities in women 31–40 years of age and in women 51–60 years of age.
Conclusions
A distinct profile of high-risk HPV genotypes was detected, with predominance of types 68 and 58. It is possible that the results of the present study are due to specific characteristics of the population, which is geographically isolated and maintains conservative sexual habits."

Host genetic factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, the role of Interleukin1Receptor, Type I (IL-1R1) gene in HBV infection and breakthrough infection in children remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between SNPs in IL-1 family and HBV infection and breakthrough infection in children.
Patients and Methods
A total of 627 Chinese children (274 HBV infected children and 353 controls) ages 6 months to 12 years were recruited from October 2013 to May 2015.Six SNPs were genotyped in IL-1R1, Interleukin-1beta (IL-1B) and Interleukin-18 (IL-18) genes.
Results
A statistically significant association was found between genotype AA in rs3917267 (IL-1R1) and HBV infection in children (OR, 1.740; 95%CI, 1.091–2.774; p=0.020), which was also found at allele A (OR, 1.316;95%CI, 1.050–1.648; p=0.017). Furthermore, rs3917267 was also significantly associated with breakthrough infection of HBV in children born of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive mothers (OR,3.675; 95%CI, 1.160-11.646; P=0.027).

Background
Daptomycin exhibits concentration-dependent antibacterial activity. By monitoring daptomycin serum concentrations, clinicians may be able to predict the effectiveness of treatments for infections more accurately. However, it has been reported that daptomycin concentrations in plasma samples stored at −20°C decrease approximately 25% after 4 weeks. The aim of this study was to evaluate the stability of daptomycin in serum at various temperatures.
Methods
Daptomycin serum samples were prepared and stored at different temperatures. The stability of daptomycin under various conditions was evaluated by sequential measurements of concentration.
Results
Although the loss of concentration of daptomycin in serum samples stored in freezers (−80°C and −20°C) was less than 10% after 168days (6 months), the concentrations in samples stored in a refrigerator (4°C) decreased by more than 70% over the same period. Furthermore, daptomycin concentrations in serum samples stored at close to body temperature (35°C, 37°C, and 39°C) decreased by more than 50% after only 24h.
Conclusions
The results of the present study demonstrate that the measurement of serum concentrations of daptomycin needs to be performed rapidly. Furthermore, the degradation of daptomycin in serum may be involved in its elimination from the living body."

Infections with Vibrio vulnificus are commonly fatal, and the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and treatment is directly linked to mortality. The main aims of this study were to investigate the clinical characteristics of six patients with V. vulnificus infections retrospectively and to determine the effect of treatment with tigecycline (TGC) alone compared with doxycycline plus ceftazidime (DOX/CAZ).
Methods
The medical records of patients were reviewed. The species-specific and pathogenic gene markers were detected by PCR, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed. Furthermore, the effects of TGC and of DOX/CAZ were determined using time–kill assays.
Results
MLST revealed six different sequence types and five of them were novel. The complete clinical pattern (vcg type C, CPS operon allele 1, 16S-rRNA type B) was found in one strain and the others had a mixed pattern. The lesion was mainly located at the distal end of the extremities and the most common clinical symptoms were fever, pain, erythema, and local swelling. The in vitro time–kill assay indicated that TGC monotherapy at a concentration of 0.1mg/l had a rapid bactericidal effect against the six tested V. vulnificus strains at 24h.
Conclusions
TGC alone might be a better potential therapeutic option than the traditional combination of DOX/CAZ against V. vulnificus."

Objective
To investigate the incidence and the pattern of causative organisms of culture-proven early-onset sepsis (EOS) in Arab states in the Gulf region.
Methods
Five neonatal care units participated in this 2-year prospective study in Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia. Data were collected prospectively using a standardized data collection form. EOS was defined as the growth of a single potentially pathogenic organism from blood or cerebrospinal fluid in infants within 72h of birth, with clinical and laboratory findings consistent with infection.
Results
Out of 67 474 live births, 102 cases of EOS occurred. The overall incidence of EOS was 1.5 (95% confidence interval 1.2–1.8) per 1000 live-births, ranging from 2.64 per 1000 live-births in Kuwait to 0.40 per 1000 live-births in King Abdulaziz Hospital in Saudi Arabia. The most common causative organism of EOS was group B Streptococcus (GBS; 60.0%), followed by Escherichia coli (13%). The incidence of invasive GBS disease was 0.90 per 1000 live-births overall and ranged from 1.4 per 1000 live-births in Kuwait to 0.6 per 1000 live-births in Dubai Hospital.
Conclusions
The incidence of EOS and the patterns of the causative organisms in the Arab states in the Gulf region are similar to those in developed countries before the era of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. Efforts should be made to improve intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis in the Arab state setting, which could avert large numbers of GBS infections."

Data on the impact of refugees on Intensive Care Units (ICUs) are lacking in the literature, in particular for community-acquired (CA) infectious diseases, for which they are known to be at higher risk. We did a descriptive, multicenter study to analyze CA infections among refugee patients requiring ICU admission.
Methods
Inclusion criteria were adult refugee patients admitted to an ICU due to CA infections. Anonymized data were collected between January 1, 2010 and December 30, 2015 across 10 referral centers.
Results
29.885 patients were admitted to the ICUs in the study period. 37 patients were included the study, the majority were from Syria (n=31, 83.8%). Mean (SD) age of the patients was 45.92±20.16years. The 5-year prevalence rate was 123.8 per 100.000 patients in the ICUs. All patients had at least one comorbid condition. Forty-nine CA infections were diagnosed. The most common CA infection was pneumonia (49%) followed by urinary-tract infections (16.3%). 21 patients (56.7%) hospitalized in the ICU had trauma history. Mortality rate was high at 22 patients (59.5%) with 5 (22.7%) deaths directly attributed to CA infections.
Conclusions
Refugees presented to ICUs with CA infections similar to the host populations (pneumonia and urinary-tract infections) but had high mortality rates (59.5%). It seems that Turkish ICUs were not congested with the refugee patients’ influx for CA infections. More research needs to be done to better understand how to deliver preventative and timely health care services to this group of patients."

Methods
A population-based cross sectional study was conducted between July 2010 and March 2013. Participants were randomly selected from the population served by the primary healthcare centers of the Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs in Riyadh, Jeddah, Alhassa and Dammam, Saudi Arabia.
Results
A total of 1369 participants were included. The overall prevalence of LTBI was similar using TST and QFT-GIT (9.3% and 9.1% respectively, p=0.872) but stratified prevalence rates were variable in all sociodemographic groups except marital status. Additionally, the prevalence rates of LTBI using either test alone showed significant differences by several sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics. The overall ARTI was 0.36% using TST and 0.35% using QFT-GIT.

Background
Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis is the main etiological agent of tegumentary leishmaniasis in the Americas. Parasite molecular diversity and host immune status contribute to extensive variations in its clinical presentation within endemic areas of Brazil. Pentavalent antimonials have been used for more than 60 years as the first-line drug for all cases, despite the potential for severe side effects and refractoriness. In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, most L. (V.) braziliensis infections are benign with a scarcity of parasites, although metastasis and refractory infections can arise. In this scenario, the use of novel molecular tools can be useful for diagnosis and to assess tissue parasitism, and is of benefit to clinical and therapeutic management.
Methods
In this study, parasite load was assessed by real-time PCR based on the leishmanial small subunit ribosomal RNA gene.
Results and conclusion
The data revealed a tendency to higher tissue parasitism in the skin compared to mucous lesion sites and a reduction with disease progression. Parasite load was lower in poor compared to good responders to antimonials, and was also reduced in recurrent lesions compared to primary ones. However, parasite load became higher with sequential relapses, pointing to an immune system inability to control the infection. Therefore the parasite burden does not seem to be a good predictor of disease progression."

Objectives
The role of prodromal fever in the clinical course of acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is still largely unclear. This study was conducted to investigate the factors associated with prodromal fever and its role in the development of acute liver failure (ALF) in patients with acute hepatitis B (AHB).
Methods
Inpatients with AHB diagnosed between January 2006 and December 2010 were evaluated and followed. Clinical manifestations, results of laboratory tests, and outcomes were compared between patients with and without prodromal fever. The diagnosis of AHB was based on the discrete onset of symptoms, jaundice, abnormal liver function tests, the detection of high-titer IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), and a compatible clinical history.
Results
A total of 618 AHB inpatients were identified during the study period, of whom 102 (16.5%) had prodromal fever and 41 (6.6%) developed ALF. Prodromal fever indicated more severe liver injury and was independently associated with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) negativity. The occurrence of ALF was more common in febrile patients than in non-febrile patients (18.6% vs. 4.3%, p<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression showed prodromal fever and temperature >38.0°C to be independently associated with the risk of ALF, with an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 3.5 (1.4–8.6) and 7.1 (2.6–19.7), respectively.
Conclusions
AHB patients with prodromal fever, which is associated with a lack of HBeAg due to HBV mutation, are at high risk of ALF. Febrile patients with AHB should be managed with particular care."

Objective
To identify the barriers to and enablers of the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV program in China.
Methods
A systematic review of the existing literature regarding barriers to and enablers of the implementation of the PMTCT program in China was performed. The checklist from the SURE guidelines (Supporting the Use of Research Evidence) was used to synthesize the barriers and enablers (supporting strategies) and to analyze their relationships. The HIV testing rate, vertical transmission rate, and antiretroviral treatment (ART) acceptance rate among HIV-infected women and their infants was also extracted from the included studies to assess the effectiveness of the enablers.
Results
Initially 794 publications were identified, and ultimately 14 articles were included. Eighteen types of barrier and nine types of supportive strategy were identified, mainly at the level of social and political issues, healthcare recipients, healthcare providers, and the healthcare system. Based on government-oriented multi-sector cooperation, enablers in China have included community–hospital–family promotion, comprehensive financial support for service recipients, free HIV testing at marriage registration, the opt-out model, and the one-to-one service model.
Conclusions
Experience in China suggests that the government’s role in coordination and the acceptability and accessibility of the service should be the primary concerns in regard to the PMTCT project."

Advances in tuberculosis (TB) vaccine development are urgently required to enhance global disease management. We evaluated the potential of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb)-derived protein antigens Rv0447c, Rv2957 and Rv2958c to boost BCG vaccine efficacy in the presence or absence of glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant formulated in a stable emulsion (GLA-SE) adjuvant.
Methods
Mice received the BCG vaccine, followed by Rv0447c, Rv2957 and Rv2958c protein boosting with or without GLA-SE adjuvant 3 and 6 weeks later. Immune responses were examined at given time points. 9 weeks post vaccination, mice were aerosol-challenged with M. tb, and sacrificed at 6 and 12 weeks to assess bacterial burden.
Results
Vaccination of mice with BCG and M. tb proteins in the presence of GLA-SE adjuvant triggered strong IFN-γ and IL-2 production by splenocytes; more TNF-α was produced without GLA-SE addition. Antibody responses to all three antigens did not differ, with or without GLA-SE adjuvant. Protein boosting without GLA-SE adjuvant resulted in vaccinated animals having better control of pulmonary M. tb load at 6 and 12 weeks post aerosol infection, while animals receiving the protein boost with GLA-SE adjuvant exhibited more bacteria in the lungs.
Conclusions
Our data provides evidence for developing Rv2958c, Rv2957 and Rv0447c in a heterologous prime-boost vaccination strategy with BCG."

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) can provide a comprehensive analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis mutations that cause resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs. With the deployment of bench-top sequencers and rapid analytical software, WGS is poised to become a useful tool to guide treatment. However, direct sequencing from clinical specimens to provide a full drug resistance profile remains a serious challenge. This article reviews current practices for extracting M. tuberculosis DNA and possible solutions for sampling sputum. Techniques under consideration include enzymatic digestion, physical disruption, chemical degradation, detergent solubilization, solvent extraction, ligand-coated magnetic beads, silica columns, and oligonucleotide pull-down baits. Selective amplification of genomic bacterial DNA in sputum prior to WGS may provide a solution, and differential lysis to reduce the levels of contaminating human DNA is also being explored. To remove this bottleneck and accelerate access to WGS for patients with suspected drug-resistant tuberculosis, it is suggested that a coordinated and collaborative approach be taken to more rapidly optimize, compare, and validate methodologies for sequencing from patient samples."

Objectives
Immune checkpoint pathways regulate optimal host immune responses against transformed cells, induce immunological memory, and limit tissue pathology. Conversely, aberrant immune checkpoint activity signifies a poor prognosis in cancer and infectious diseases. Host-directed therapy (HDT) via immune checkpoint blockade has revolutionized cancer treatment with therapeutic implications for chronic infections, thus laying the foundation for this review.
Methods
Online literature searches were performed via PubMed, PubMed Central, and Google using the keywords “immune checkpoint inhibition”; “host-directed therapy”; “T cell exhaustion”; “cancer immunotherapy”; “anti-PD-1 therapy”; “anti-PD-L1 therapy”; “chronic infections”; “antigen-specific cells”; “tuberculosis”; “malaria”; “viral infections”; “human immunodeficiency virus”; “hepatitis B virus”; “hepatitis C virus”; “cytomegalovirus” and “Epstein–Barr virus”. Search results were filtered based on relevance to the topics covered in this review.
Results
The use of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen-experienced T-cell marker programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 in the context of chronic infectious diseases is reviewed. The potential pitfalls and precautions, based on clinical experience from treating patients with cancer with PD-1/PD-L1 pathway inhibitors, are also described.
Conclusions
Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy holds promise as adjunctive therapy for chronic infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV, and must therefore be tested in randomized clinical trials."

To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of routine blood examinations and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) lactate level for Post-neurosurgical Bacterial Meningitis (PBM) at a large sample-size of post-neurosurgical patients.
Methods
The diagnostic accuracies of routine blood examinations and CSF lactate level to distinguish between PAM and PBM were evaluated with the values of the Area Under the Curve of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC-ROC) by retrospectively analyzing the datasets of post-neurosurgical patients in the clinical information databases.
Results
The diagnostic accuracy of routine blood examinations was relatively low (AUC-ROC<0.7). The CSF lactate level achieved rather high diagnostic accuracy (AUC-ROC=0.891; CI 95%, 0.852-0.922). The variables of patient age, operation duration, surgical diagnosis and postoperative days (the interval days between the neurosurgery and examinations) were shown to affect the diagnostic accuracy of these examinations. The variables were integrated with routine blood examinations and CSF lactate level by Fisher discriminant analysis to improve their diagnostic accuracy. As a result, the diagnostic accuracy of blood examinations and CSF lactate level was significantly improved with an AUC-ROC value=0.760 (CI 95%, 0.737-0.782) and 0.921 (CI 95%, 0.887-0.948) respectively.
Conclusions
The PBM diagnostic accuracy of routine blood examinations was relatively low, whereas the accuracy of CSF lactate level was high. Some variables that are involved in the incidence of PBM can also affect the diagnostic accuracy for PBM. Taking into account the effects of these variables significantly improves the diagnostic accuracies of routine blood examinations and CSF lactate level."

Objective
To compare the efficacy and safety of different pivmecillinam (PIV) regimes for uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections (UTIs).
Methods
The MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched. Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) involving adults or children with symptoms suggestive of uncomplicated UTI and that compared different PIV regimes or PIV versus other antibiotics were included. Meta-analyses were conducted to obtain direct and indirect efficacy estimates. PIV regimes were categorized into high total dosage, moderate total dosage, and low total dosage. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane tool.
Results
Twenty-four RCTs were identified. No difference in clinical cure was found for the high vs. moderate (short-term: risk ratio (RR) 1.01, p=0.813; long term: RR 1.09, p=0.174) or high vs. low dosage comparisons (mean difference 0, 95% confidence interval −0.44 to 0.45, p=1). For bacteriological cure, comparisons of high vs. moderate dosage (short term: RR 1.05, p=0.056; long term: RR 1.05, p=0.131) and high vs. low dosage (short term: RR 1.02, p=0.759; long term: RR 1.13, p=0.247) showed a trend in favor of the high dosage treatment. Results for relapse, re-infection, and failure were inconclusive and not statistically significant. Patients treated with high dosages were 40% (p=0.062) and 44% (p=0.293) more likely to report mild to moderate adverse events.
Conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of an optimal combination of dosage, frequency, and duration of PIV therapy for the treatment of uncomplicated lower UTI. Evidence is limited due to the high risk of bias, poor reporting, and heterogeneous study data."

abstract = "Background
Herpes zoster (HZ) is characterized by debilitating pain and blistering dermatomal rash. The most common complication of HZ is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a persistent pain that can substantially affect patients’ quality of life. HZ has significant impact on patients’ lives with considerable implications for healthcare systems and society. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and medical costs associated with HZ in Latin America.
Method
We conducted a pooled-analysis of three prospective cohort studies of HZ patients ≥50 years of age in Argentina (n=96); Brazil (n=145) and Mexico (n=142). Patients were recruited at different time-points during their HZ episode and were followed for six months. The incidence of PHN was defined as a worst ZBPI pain score of ≥3, persisting or appearing more than 90 days after the onset of rash. Work effectiveness was measured on a 100-point Likert scale where 100 was described as completely effective (able to work like before HZ began) and 0 as not effective at all. Direct costs included costs due to use of antiviral medications and all medical services used to treat HZ. Indirect cost was based on foregone earnings from patients due to work loss and presenteeism, and work loss by family caretakers. One-way sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the impact on total costs. All costs are reported in 2015 USD currency.
Results
383 HZ patients were included and PHN incidence was 38.6%. The most commonly used resources were visits to the doctor’s office (79.1% of patients), the emergency room (48.8%) and a specialist (37.9%); hospitalization was reported for 5.7% of patients. The overall direct cost per case was $763.19 USD, indirect cost was $701.40, for a total of $1,464.59 per HZ episode in Latin America. Total cost associated with HZ in patients with PHN was markedly higher compared to patients without PHN ($2,001.13 vs. $867.72, respectively) with indirect costs accounting for the most part of this difference. The sensitivity analysis was generally robust to changes in the assumptions made.
Conclusion
HZ and its sequelae impose a substantial economic burden in Latin America which is expected to rise as the population ages and the number of HZ cases increases. The results support the need for early intervention, preventative strategies and improved disease management to reduce the HZ-associated disease burden in Latin America."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) is the world’s most widely distributed vaccine, used against tuberculosis (TB), in cancer immunotherapy, and in autoimmune diseases due to its immunomodulatory properties. To date, the effect of BCG vaccination on antibody responses to host proteins has not been reported. High-content peptide microarrays (HCPM) offer a unique opportunity to gauge specific humoral immune responses.
Methods
The sera of BCG-vaccinated healthy adults were tested on a human HCPM platform (4953 randomly selected epitopes of human proteins) to detect specific immunoglobulin gamma (IgG) responses. Samples were obtained at 56, 112, and 252 days after vaccination. Immunohistology was performed on lymph node tissue from patients with TB lymphadenitis. Results were analysed with a combination of existing and novel statistical methods.
Results
IgG recognition of host peptides exhibited a peak at day 56 post BCG vaccination in all study subjects tested, which diminished over time. Primarily, IgG responses exhibited increased reactivity to ion transporters (sodium, calcium channels), cytokine receptors (interleukin 2 receptor β (IL2Rβ), fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1)), other cell surface receptors (inositol, somatostatin, angiopoeitin), ribonucleoprotein, and enzymes (tyrosine kinases, phospholipase) on day 56. There was decreased IgG reactivity to transforming growth factor-beta type 1 receptor (TGFβR1) and, in agreement with the peptide microarray findings, immunohistochemical analysis of TB-infected lymph node samples revealed an overexpression of TGFβR in granulomatous lesions. Moreover, the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) showed increased reactivity on days 112 and 252, but not on day 56 post-vaccination. IgG to interleukin 4 receptor (IL4R) showed increased reactivity at 112 days post-vaccination, while IgG to IL2Rβ and FGFR1 showed decreased reactivity on days 112 and 252 as compared to day 56 post BCG vaccination.
Conclusions
BCG vaccination modifies the host’s immune landscape after 56 days, but this imprint changes over time. This may influence the establishment of immunological memory in BCG-vaccinated individuals."

To explore the epidemiological trend of dengue in mainland China.
Methods
Data on dengue cases reported from 2005 to 2015 were collected, and epidemiological trends, including average age, occupation, seasonal distribution, and interval from illness onset to confirmation, were analyzed using SPSS 19.0 and R 3.1.1.
Results
A total of 59 334 dengue cases were recorded in China during the years 2005–2015. Most dengue cases occurred in individuals aged between 21 years and 50 years. Of note, the median age of dengue cases did not show a trend towards becoming younger; the median age was significantly older than that of cases in dengue endemic areas. The proportion of cases occurring during September and October was higher in 2012–2015 than in 2005–2011. The number of affected provinces ranged between 10 and 27 and the number of affected counties ranged between 42 and 415. The median time from illness onset to confirmation of dengue decreased sharply in 2015, indicating that comprehensive measures have been taken in mainland China.

This study aimed to investigate proteinuria occurring during dengue disease in children and assess if measurement of this parameter can help physicians in the clinical management of patients.

Proteinuria was assessed by dipstick and quantified by urine protein:creatinine ratio (UPCR) in samples from patients hospitalized with a confirmed dengue infection and in healthy controls.
Results
The dipstick tested positive in 42.9% of the patients presenting at hospital with dengue versus 20.0% in healthy controls. UPCR increased during the critical phase of the disease; peaking one week after fever onset then decreasing as the patients recovered. Patients with warnings signs or severe dengue were more likely to present with proteinuria detected by UPCR at the time of hospital admission compared to patients without warning signs. The sensitivity of this marker, however, was limited as only 16.1% of the patients with warning signs had proteinuria.
Conclusions
Urine dipstick and UPCR do not seem to be very valuable for the triage of the patients at the time of the initial consultation but the observation of a decrease of the UPCR during the course of the illness appears to indicate an evolution towards recovery."

abstract = "Introduction
Prisons are known to be a high risk environment for tuberculosis (TB) due to overcrowding, low levels of nutrition, poor infection control and lack of accessible healthcare services. India has nearly 1400 prisons housing 0.37 million inmates. However, information on, availability of diagnostic and treatment services for TB in the prison settings is limited. This study examined the availability of TB services in prisons of India. Simultaneously, prison inmates were screened for tuberculosis.
Method
The study was conducted in 157 prisons across 300 districts between July-December 2013. Information on services available and practices followed for screening, diagnosis and treatment of TB was collected. Additionally, the inmates and prison staff were sensitised on TB using interpersonal communication materials. The inmates were screened for cough ≥2 weeks as a symptom of TB. Those identified as presumptive TB patients (PTBP) were linked with free diagnostic and treatment services.
Results
Diagnostic and treatment services for TB were available in 18% and 54% of the prisons respectively. Only half of the prisons screened inmates for TB on entry, while nearly 60% practised periodic screening of inmates. District level prisons (OR, 6.0; 95% CI, 1.6-22.1), prisons with more than 500 inmates (OR, 52; 95% CI, 1.4-19.2), and prisons practising periodic screening of inmates (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.0-7.2) were more likely to diagnose TB cases. 19% of the inmates screened had symptoms of TB (cough ≥2 weeks) and 8% of the PTBP were diagnosed with TB on smear microscopy.
Conclusion
The TB screening, diagnostic and treatment services are sub-optimal in prisons in India and need to be strengthened urgently."

Nine out of ten tuberculosis deaths occur in tuberculosis-burdened countries, particularly Sub Saharan Africa. In these setting mortality has not been fully described. We describe the magnitude and pattern of TB mortality in Tanzania.
METHODS
A multicenter prospective cohort study was conducted among HIV infected and uninfected pulmonary tuberculosis patients from time of anti-TB treatment initiation to completion. Patients were censored at the time of treatment completion, or at their last visit for those who did not complete TB treatment. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate time to death; cox proportional hazards model was used to examine risk factors for mortality.
RESULTS
A total of 58 deaths out of 1696 patients (3.4%) occurred, two thirds (n=39) during the first two months of treatment. Compared to HIV un-infected TB patients, mortality risk for TB/HIV co-infected patients was least when antiretroviral therapy (ART) was initiated after 14 days of anti-TB (RR=3.55; 95% CI: 1.44, 8.73 p<0.0001) and highest when ART was initiated 90 days or less prior to anti-TB and within the first 14 days of anti-TB therapy (RR=10; 95% CI: 3.28, 30.54; p<0.0001).
CONCLUSION
Meticulously planned and supervised antiretroviral therapy reduces mortality among TB/HIV patients. Among patients with TB/HIV naïve of ART, withholding ART until the third week of anti-tuberculosis therapy will likely reduce TB mortality in Tanzania. Patients on ART and later develop tuberculosis should be closely monitored."

We reviewed the outbreak investigation reports and medical records of 1 index case and 25 additional MERS cases in hospitals A (14 cases) and B (11 cases), and conducted an in-depth interview with the index case.
Results
The CFR in hospital B was higher than that in hospital A (63.6% vs. 28.6%, respectively). Higher MERS-CoV exposure conditions were also found in hospital B, including aggravated pneumonia in the index case and nebulizer use in a six-bed admission room. The host factors associated with high CFR were pre-existing pneumonia, smoking history, an incubation period of less than 5 days, leukocytosis, abnormal renal function at diagnosis, and respiratory symptoms such as sputum and dyspnea.
Conclusions
The conditions surrounding MERS-CoV exposure and the underlying poor pulmonary function due to a smoking history or pre-existing pneumonia may explain the high CFR in hospital B. The clinical features described above may enable prediction of the prognosis of MERS cases."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
The aim of this study was to use a quasi-Poisson regression model to estimate the mortality burden associated with influenza type/subtypes in a subtropical city in China, for the years 2010–2015.
Methods
Quasi-Poisson models were fitted separately to weekly numbers of deaths from various causes. The exploratory variables were products of weekly proportions of specimens positive for influenza type/subtypes and weekly influenza-like illness consultation rates to represent influenza activity. Adjustments were made for long-term and seasonal trends, absolute humidity, and population size as confounding factors in the models. Excess deaths associated with influenza were regarded as the measurement for disease burden of influenza.
Results
The excess mortality for all-cause death associated with influenza was 9.9 per 100000 population in Hefei, with influenza A(H3N2) virus having the highest excess mortality rate, followed by influenza A(H1N1) virus and influenza B virus. Following the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the highest excess mortality rate associated with influenza for different causes was consistently found in the year 2014, with the excess mortality rate for all-cause death reaching 17.47 per 100000 population. The sex differences in influenza-associated mortality were not statistically significant (p>0.05).
Conclusions
The mortality burden of influenza has been substantial in Hefei since the 2009 influenza pandemic, while the evidence on sex differences in mortality burden is limited. The severity profile of influenza type/subtypes in China needs to be assessed and confirmed in more cities in future studies."

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is acute viral infection and a major emerging infectious diseases threat, affecting a large geographical area. There is no proven antiviral therapy and it has a case fatality rate of 4–30%. The natural history of disease and outcomes of CCHF in pregnant women is poorly understood.
Objectives
To systematically review the characteristics of CCHF in pregnancy, and report a case series of 8 CCHF cases in pregnant women from Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkey.
Methods
A systematic review was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement protocol. PubMed, SCOPUS, Science Citation Index (SCI) were searched for reports published between January 1960 and June 2016. Two independent reviewers selected and reviewed studies and extracted data.
Results
Thirty-four cases of CCHF in pregnancy were identified, and combined with the case series data, 42 cases were analyzed. The majority of cases originated in Turkey (14), Iran (10) and Russia (6). There was a maternal mortality of 14/41(34%) and fetal/neonatal mortality of in 24/41 cases (58.5%). Hemorrhage was associated with maternal (p=0.009) and fetal/neonatal death (p<0.0001). There was nosocomial transmission to 38 cases from 6/37 index pregnant cases.
Conclusion
Cases of CCHF in pregnancy are rare, but associated with high rates of maternal and fetal mortality, and nosocomial transmission."

Endobronchial tuberculosis (EBTB) is a challenging diagnosis because of its varied clinical and radiological manifestations. Hilar asymmetry on chest radiograph (CXR) may be found in patient with EBTB but is often overlooked, which may lead to delayed diagnosis.
Case report
We present five cases with EBTB. Clinicians failed to identify unilateral hilar abnormalities on CXR, and these patients were treated initially for pharyngitis, bronchitis, or pneumonia with no improvement. Subsequently, they visited the pulmonary clinic and bronchoscopy revealed endobronchial lesions and microbial/histopathological evidence of tuberculous infection consistent with EBTB. Anti-tuberculosis therapy resulted in complete clinical resolution in four of the five patients; one patient had persistent bronchial stenosis.
Conclusion
Hilar asymmetry on CXR may occur with EBTB and may suggest this diagnosis in the appropriate clinical setting. Bronchoscopy has an important role in establishing the final diagnosis."

We described Klebsiella pneumoniae producing carbapenemase (CPKP) spread from 01/01/2015 to 13/09/16 in a tertiary level hospital.
Methods
The first positive surveillance rectal swab (SRS) or clinical sample (CS) collected in the medical department (MD), surgical department (SD) and intensive care department (ICD) were included in the study. A validated in-house Real-Time PCR method was used to detect carbapenemases; multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used for further characterization of the strains.
Results
21535 patients were included: 213 CPKP strains from surveillance rectal swab (SRS) and 98 from clinical samples (CS) were collected. The percentage of CPKP detected in SRS with respect to CS increased in the medical MD from 2015 to 2016 (p=0.01) and in ICD from 2012 to 2015 (p=0.0001), while it decreased in SD from 2014 to 2016 (p=0.003); 68.5% of the positive SRS had a previous negative SRS; CPKP was more frequently identified in CS than in SRS in MD. Twelve strains harboured more than one carbapenemase gene. Many other species harbouring a carbapenemase gene were collected.
Conclusions
MDs need more inclusive surveillance criteria. The late detection of positive SRS underlined the risk of colonization during hospitalization."

The primary objective was to describe clinical features, treatment and outcomes in patients with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) bacteremia. Additionally, patients treated with ceftazidime/avibactam (study group) were compared to the rest of the patients (comparator group) to determine the influence of the treatment in both crude mortality and clinical cure.
Methods
Multicenter and retrospective study that included patients with hematologic malignancies who had CPE bacteremia. A bivariate analysis was performed to compare the clinical variables between the study group and the control group.
Results
31 patients were included. Bacteremia was considered primary in 14 (45%) patients. Overall crude mortality at 30days was 45.2% (n=14). Mortality was more frequent when septic shock (78.6% vs 11.8%; p>0.001) and higher Pitt score (6+14 vs 1.5+4; p<0.01) were present. 8 patients (25.8%) received treatment with ceftazidime/avibactam. No significant differences in crude mortality were found between study and comparator groups (p=0.19). In contrast, patients in study group had higher clinical cure rates than the comparator group within 14days of initiating treatment (85.7% vs. 34.8%, respectively, p=0.031).
Conclusions
CPE bacteremia is associated with high mortality in patients with hematologic malignancies. Ceftazidime/avibactam may be an effective alternative for treating these patients."

To obtain data on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) associated hospitalization rates in preterm infants of 28 weeks gestational age and less in the era of palivizumab prophylaxis.
Methods
Retrospective single-center cohort study including all preterm infants up to 28 weeks+6days gestational age and born between 2004 and 2012 at a tertiary care university hospital. Data on RSV related hospitalizations over the first two years of life covering at least two RSV seasons (November-April) were analyzed.
Results
Ninety-one of 287 (32%) infants were hospitalized due to respiratory illness, and a total of 17 infants (5.9%) tested RSV positive during the first 2 years of life. Fourteen infants (4.9%) were hospitalized during the first RSV season. RSV hospitalization rate in infants with BPD was 4.5% (2/44) compared to 4.9% (12/243) without BPD. Palivizumab prophylaxis was documented in 74.6% of the infants. Infants with RSV compared to other respiratory tract infection were of younger age (6.8 vs. 9.1 months; p=0.049), had longer hospital stays (median 11 vs. 5 days; p=0.043) and more severe respiratory illness (median LRI score 3 vs. 2; p=0.043).

Objectives
This study aimed to investigate the incidence of late-onset sepsis (LOS) in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in Arab states in the Gulf region and to describe the main causative organisms and their antibiotic resistance.
Methods
This observational prospective cohort study was conducted over a 2-year period in five NICUs in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. LOS was defined as the growth of a single potentially pathogenic organism from blood or cerebrospinal fluid in infants >3days of age with clinical and laboratory findings consistent with infection.
Results
Seven hundred and eighty-five cases of LOS occurred among 67 474 live births. The overall incidence of LOS was 11.63 (95% confidence interval (CI) 10.84–12.47) per 1000 live births, or 56.14 (95% CI 52.38–60.08) per 1000 admissions. Coagulase-negative staphylococci and Klebsiella spp were the most common organisms, causing 272 (34.65%) and 179 (22.80%) of LOS cases, respectively. No evidence of a seasonal variation in the incidence of Klebsiella spp or in the incidence of all Gram-negative organisms was found. More than half of the Klebsiella spp were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins.
Conclusion
LOS poses a major burden in this area, which could be due to the increasing care of premature babies. Gram-negative organisms, particularly Klebsiella spp, are having an increasing role in LOS in this region, with high levels of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins. NICUs in the area should create a platform through which to share experience in reducing neonatal sepsis and contribute to a common antibiotic stewardship program."

: This study examines the microbiological characteristics of invasive Haemophilus influenae serotype a (Hia) isolates from Nunavik (northern Quebec), Canada. The relationship between invasive Hia isolates from Nunavik, Nunavut, Canada, and Alaska, USA will be discussed.
Methods
Twenty invasive Hia isolates were recovered from patients in Nunavik from 2010 to 2013 and characterized by biotype, multi-locus sequence typing, IS1016-bexA deletion, antibiotic susceptibility and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).
Results
All 20 Hia isolates were biotype II, sequence type −23, did not have IS1016-bexA deletions and were susceptible to all antibiotics tested. PFGE showed only two patterns, with 19 isolates giving identical molecular fingerprints, and the remaining isolate gave a PFGE pattern >95% similar.
Conclusion
One major clone of Hia appears to be causing invasive disease in Nunavik, Canada. Based on previous studies, Hia from Nunavut were also typed as ST-23, while invasive Hia isolates from Alaska belonged to either ST-23 or closely related STs. Thus invasive Hia in the North America Arctic belonged to the ST-23 clonal complex and lacked the IS1016-bexA partial deletion."

Intact immune responses to cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) represent a biologically and clinically relevant correlate of ‘immunological fitness’ in humans. However, there is a lack of knowledge concerning anti-EBV or anti-CMV responses in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), in whom aberrant immune responses may promote progression of clinical disease.
Methods
Venous blood samples were obtained at the time of (sputum smear positive) pulmonary TB diagnosis. A whole blood assay was performed by exposing PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) to a panel of infectious antigens, including CMV, EBV and mycobacterial proteins. Cell culture supernatants were collected after seven days and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) was measured using a sandwich ELISA. Patients received standard first line anti-tuberculosis rifampicin (R)/isoniazid (H)/ethambutol (E)/pyrazinamide (Z) for two months followed by RH for four months.
Results
PBMCs from cured patients (after treatment completion) exhibited significantly stronger IFN-γ responses to CMV (p=0.035), EBV (p=0.006) or Mycobacterium tuberculosis ESAT-6 (p=0.043) at the time of diagnosis as compared to patients who succumbed to TB during treatment. IFN-γ responses to other viral (H5N1, HSV-1) as well as other mycobacterial (Ag85A, Rv2958c, Rv0447c) antigens were not found to be significantly different among patients who were cured or those who succumbed to TB.
Conclusions
Increased cellular immune responses to CMV and EBV antigens at the time of diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis are associated with increased survival after a standard six months anti-TB therapy. CVM and EBV antigens may represent “intrinsic markers for immune fitness” and guide improved TB therapies including host-directed therapies."

Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is the most widespread, tick-borne viral disease affecting humans. The disease is endemic in many regions, such as Africa, Asia, Eastern and Southern Europe, and Central Asia. Recently, the incidence of CCHF has increased rapidly in the countries of the World Health Organization Eastern Mediterranean Region (WHO EMR), with sporadic human cases and outbreaks of CCHF being reported from a number of countries in the region. Despite the rapidly growing incidence of the disease, there are currently no accurate data on the burden of the disease in the region due to the different surveillance systems used for CCHF in these countries. In an effort to increase our understanding of the epidemiology and risk factors for the transmission of the CCHF virus (CCHFV; a Nairovirus of the family Bunyaviridae) in the WHO EMR, and to identify the current knowledge gaps that are hindering effective control interventions, a sub-regional meeting was organized in Muscat, Oman, from December 7 to 9, 2015. This article summarizes the current knowledge of the disease in the region, identifies the knowledge gaps that present challenges for the prevention and control of CCHFV, and details a strategic framework for research and development activities that would be necessary to curb the ongoing and new threats posed by CCHFV."

Objectives
The results of the T-SPOT.TB (T-SPOT) assay are reduced in immunocompromised patients with active tuberculosis (ATB), and it is difficult using T-SPOT results to distinguish ATB from latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in this condition. The aim of this study was to determine the performance of the TBAg/PHA ratio in T-SPOT assay in the diagnosis of ATB in immunocompromised patients.
Methods
One hundred and forty three immunocompromised ATB patients and 124 LTBI individuals were diagnosed according to conventional tests and T-SPOT assay.
Results
The results of T-SPOT assay are of no value in the diagnosis of ATB in immunocompromised patients. However, the number of phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) spot-forming cells (sfc) in T-SPOT assay was substantially decreased in immunocompromised ATB patients compared with that in LTBI individuals. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that a further calculation of the TBAg/PHA ratio (the larger of the ESAT-6/PHA and CFP-10/PHA) showed a better performance in distinguishing these two diseases. Using the threshold value of 0.316, the sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing immunocompromised ATB patients from LTBI individuals were respectively 79.21 and 94.05%.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that the TBAg/PHA ratio might have some significance for the diagnosis of TB disease in immunocompromised patients."

Objective
To establish the relationship between hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) serological markers in the Northern Territory, Australia.
Methods
A retrospective serological study of patients presenting to public healthcare facilities in the Northern Territory between 2008 and 2015 was performed in order to determine the presence and relationships of serological markers of HBV and HTLV-1.
Results
Seven hundred and forty individual patients were found to be serologically positive for HTLV-1 in the Northern Territory over the 8-year period. Hepatitis B results were available for 521 of these patients. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity was demonstrated in 15.9% (83/521) of this cohort, which was significantly different to the HTLV-1-negative group (3.7%, 125/3354) (p<0.001). Excluding individuals with isolated hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), those in the HTLV-1-positive group had a higher HBV exposure history (67.5%, 352/521) when compared to HTLV-1-negative individuals (37.8%, 1259/3354) (p<0.001). HTLV-1-positive individuals had a lower prevalence of HBV combined anti-HBs and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) positive markers compared to those who were HTLV-1-negative (56.3% (198/352) versus 73.8% (937/1269), respectively; p<0.001).
Conclusions
A significantly higher prevalence rate of HBV was found in HTLV-1-positive individuals from the Northern Territory. When considering the higher exposure to HBV in HTLV-1-positive individuals, the clearance of HBV appears lower than in those individuals testing HTLV-1-negative. A lower prevalence of clearance in HTVL-1-positive individuals than in HTLV-1-negative individuals, as signified by formation of HBVcAb and HBVsAb in HTVL-1 positive individual’s may equate to higher prevalence of ongoing coinfection."

Objectives
We conducted a cross-sectional survey in 2012 among 22 rural barangays in Northern Samar, the Philippines in order to determine the prevalence of single and multiple species helminth infections, their geospatial distribution and underlying risk factors.
Methods
A total of 10,434 individuals who had completed both a medical questionnaire and a stool examination were included in the analysis. Barangay specific prevalence rates were displayed in ArcMap.
Results
The prevalence of Trichuris trichiura infection was found to be the highest at 62.4%, followed by Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm and S. japonicum with the prevalence rates of 40.2%, 31.32%, and 27.1%, respectively. 52.7% of people were infected with at least two parasites and 4.8% with all four parasites. Males aged 10-19 years were the most vulnerable to coinfection infection. Students, fishermen, farmers and housewives were the most vulnerable occupations for co-infection of A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura. Considerable heterogeneity in the spatial distribution was observed for the different parasite species. There was a considerably higher risk of A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura co-infection in villages with no schistosomiasis infection (P<0.0001) regardless of MDA treatment.
Conclusions
A better understanding of the geospatial distribution of multi-parasitism will guide future integrated strategies leading to elimination."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Broad-range 16S rRNA PCR can be used for the detection and identification of bacteria from clinical specimens in patients for whom there is a high suspicion of infection and cultures are negative. The aims of this study were (1) to compare 16S rRNA PCR results with microbiological culture results, (2) to assess the utility of 16S rRNA PCR with regard to antimicrobial therapy, and (3) to compare the yield of 16S rRNA PCR for different types of clinical specimen and to perform a cost analysis of the test.
Methods
A retrospective study was performed on different clinical specimens which had 16S performed over 3 years (2012–2015). Standard microbiological cultures were performed on appropriate media, as per the laboratory protocol. Patient clinical and microbiological data were obtained from the electronic medical records and laboratory information system, respectively. 16S rRNA PCR was performed in a reference laboratory using a validated method for amplification and sequencing. The outcomes assessed were the performance of 16S rRNA PCR, change of antimicrobials (rationalization, cessation, or addition), and duration of therapy. Concordance of 16S rRNA PCR with bacterial cultures was also determined for tissue specimens.
Results
Thirty-two patients were included in the study, for whom an equal number of specimens (n=32) were sent for 16S rRNA PCR. 16S rRNA PCR could identify an organism in 10 of 32 cases (31.2%), of which seven were culture-positive and three were culture-negative. The sensitivity was 58% (confidence interval (CI) 28.59–83.5%) and specificity was 85% (CI 61.13–96%), with a positive predictive value of 70% (CI 35.3–91.9%) and negative predictive value of 77.2% (CI 54.17–91.3%). Antimicrobial therapy was rationalized after 16S rRNA PCR results in five patients (15.6%) and was ceased in four based on negative results (12.5%). Overall the 16S rRNA PCR result had an impact on antimicrobial therapy in 28% of patients (9/32). The highest concordance of 16S rRNA PCR with bacterial culture was found for heart valve tissue (80%), followed by joint fluid/tissue (50%).
Conclusions
Despite the low diagnostic yield, results of 16S rRNA PCR can still have a significant impact on patient management due to rationalization or cessation of the antimicrobial therapy. The yield of 16S rRNA PCR was highest for heart valves."

Background
Diseases caused by mosquito-borne viruses are among the most important emerging diseases that threaten human and animal health, particularly in Africa. However, little attention has been paid to these diseases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The present cross-sectional study was undertaken between March and May 2014 to investigate the presence of mosquito-borne viruses in mosquitoes collected from five municipalities of Kinshasa, DRC.
Methods
Mosquitoes were collected using BG-Sentinel traps and battery-powered aspirators. Female mosquitoes were pooled according to their genera and sampling locations, preserved in RNAlater, and later screened for viruses using reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assays.
Results
A total of 2922 mosquitoes were collected and 29 pools of female mosquitoes, containing approximately 30 mosquitoes each, were tested. Twelve of the 29 (41.4%) mosquito pools were found to be infected with at least one arbovirus, with eight (27.5%) pools positive for Alphavirus, nine (31%) for Flavivirus, and five (17.2%) for Bunyaviridae. Chikungunya, o’nyong’nyong, and Rift valley fever viruses were detected.
Conclusions
The present study shows that mosquitoes in Kinshasa carry mosquito-borne viruses that may have serious public health implications. Further investigations on the presence of mosquito-borne viruses in the human and livestock populations of Kinshasa and DRC are recommended."

Background
Nocardiosis is a rare disease with polymorphic presentations. The epidemiology and clinical presentation could change with the increasing number of immunocompromised patients.
Methods
The medical records and microbiological data of patients affected by nocardiosis and treated at the university hospitals of Marseille between 2004 and 2014 were analyzed retrospectively.
Results
The cases of 34 patients infected by Nocardia spp during this period were analyzed. The main underlying conditions were transplantation (n=15), malignancy (n=9), cystic fibrosis (n=4), and immune disease (n=3); no immunodeficiency condition was observed for three patients. No case of AIDS was observed. At diagnosis, 61.8% had received steroids for over 3 months. Four clinical presentations were identified, depending on the underlying condition: the disseminated form (50.0%) and the visceral isolated form (26.5%) in severely immunocompromised patients, the bronchial form (14.7%) in patients with chronic lung disease, and the cutaneous isolated form (8.8%) in immunocompetent patients. Nocardia farcinica was the main species identified (26.5%). Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole was prescribed in 68.0% of patients, and 38.0% underwent surgery. Mortality was 11.7%, and the patients who died had disseminated or visceral nocardiosis.
Conclusions
The clinical presentation and outcome of nocardiosis depend on the patient’s initial immune status and underlying pulmonary condition. Severe forms were all iatrogenic, occurring after treatments altering the immune system."

Introduction
Sarcoidosis is considered an idiopathic granulomatous disease, although similar immunological and clinical features with tuberculosis (TB) suggest mycobacterial involvement in its pathogenesis. High-content peptide microarrays (HCPM) may help to decipher mycobacteria-specific antibody reactivity in sarcoidosis.
Methods
Serum samples from patients with sarcoidosis, Löfgren’s syndrome, and TB, as well as from healthy individuals (12/group), were tested on HCPM containing 5964 individual peptides spanning 154 Mycobacterium tuberculosis proteins displayed as 15-amino acid stretches. Inclusion/exclusion and significance analyses were performed according to published methods.
Results
Each study group recognized 68–78% M. tuberculosis peptides at least once. M. tuberculosis epitope recognition by sarcoidosis patient sera was 42.7%, and by TB patient sera was 39.1%. Seven and 16 peptides were recognized in 9/12 (75%) and 8/12 (67%) sarcoidosis patient sera but not in TB patient sera, respectively. Nine (75%) and eight (67%) out of twelve TB patient sera, respectively recognized M. tuberculosis peptides that were not recognized in sarcoidosis patient sera.
Conclusions
Specific IgG recognition patterns for M. tuberculosis antigens in sarcoidosis patients re-affirm mycobacterial involvement in sarcoidosis, providing biologically relevant targets for future studies pertaining to diagnostics and immunotherapy."

Background
Viral central nervous system (CNS) infections are typically characterized by a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lymphocytic pleocytosis. A CSF neutrophilic pleocytosis presentation has been described, but its prognostic and clinical significance is unknown. The objectives of this study were to (1) compare the clinical and laboratory characteristics of viral CNS infections with a CSF neutrophilic pleocytosis to those with a lymphocytic pleocytosis, and (2) evaluate factors associated with an adverse clinical outcome.
Methods
A retrospective study of patients with confirmed viral CNS infections was conducted. The patients were divided into those with CSF neutrophilic pleocytosis and those with CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis. Clinical findings and outcomes were compared between the two groups.
Results
Of the 182 patients included in the study, 45 (24.7%) had CSF neutrophilic pleocytosis. Enterovirus infections were the cause of 64% of neutrophil-predominant CSF and 33% of lymphocyte-predominant CSF (p<0.001), while herpes infections were the cause of 46% of lymphocytic pleocytosis and 20% of neutrophilic pleocytosis (p=0.003). Moreover, neutrophilic pleocytosis was seen more commonly in younger patients (p=0.001), patients with respiratory symptoms (p=0.04), and patients with higher CSF white cell counts (p=0.004). Twenty-nine patients had an adverse clinical outcome (15.9%); the only predictor independently associated with an adverse clinical outcome on multivariable logistic regression analysis was an encephalitis presentation (p=0.01).
Conclusions
The results of a study exploring the association between CSF neutrophilic pleocytosis and clinical and prognostic significance are presented here. This study suggests that CSF neutrophilic pleocytosis is not associated with higher adverse clinical outcomes."

abstract = "Background
The addition of ribavirin (RBV) to the combination treatment of Ledipasvir (LDV) and Sofosbuvir (SOF) remains controversial in the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We performed a meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of the LDV-SOF with and without RBV in treating HCV genotype 1 patients.
Method
The electronical databases of PubMed Medline, EMBASE database, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and ClinicalTrials.gov website with registered trials were searched. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies that assessed the efficacy and safety of LDV-SOF with or without RBV in patients with HCV genotype 1 (GT 1). Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed methodology quality. Review Manager 5.3 software was used to analyze the data.
Results
Seven studies involving 2,626 patients with HCV GT 1 – some of whom had cirrhosis − were included in this meta-analysis. The addition of RBV to LDV- SOF regimen neither significantly improved sustained viral response at 12 weeks (SVR12) after the last dose of treatment (RR=1.00, 95%CI 0.99-1.01, p=0.99) nor decreased virologic breakthrough (RR=1.01, 95%CI 0.14-7.19, p=0.99) and relapse (RR=1.36, 95% CI 0.81-2.29, p=0.24). There was no significant difference in the incidence of discontinuation (RR=0.61, 95%CI 0.25-1.53, p=0.30) between LDV- SOF therapy and LDV- SOF plus RBV. LDV- SOF plus RBV therapy had significantly higher rate of the overall adverse events (RR=0.88, 95%CI=0.84- 0.92, p<0.00001). LDV − SOF therapy had higher incidence of serious adverse events (RR=1.60, 95%CI=1.00-2.56, p=0.05) than LDV-SOF plus RBV.
Conclusion
This meta-analysis suggests that LDV-SOF based therapy is a safe and effective treatment for patients with GT 1 HCV. The addition of RBV to LDV-SOF may increase toxicity without achieving improved efficacy. However, due to the relatively small sample sizes and moderate risk of bias of included studies, large-scale and high-quality clinical research is still needed to confirm the results."

Objective
Few studies have sought to establish how often death after sepsis is related to the sepsis and how often underlying diseases have a major role in case fatality.
Methods
In this retrospective cohort study, data were collected on 497 cases with blood culture-positive sepsis in an emergency department (ED).
Results
Sepsis was categorized as severe in 31% of cases; 7% had septic shock. The quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment score was positive in 136 out of 473 cases (29%). Ninety-eight patients died by day 90; in 16 of these cases (16%) the death was sepsis-related in a patient without a rapidly fatal underlying disease, in 45 cases (46%) the death was sepsis-related in a patient with a rapidly fatal underlying disease, and in 37 cases (38%) the death was unrelated to sepsis. Sepsis-related death occurred in 58 out of 61 cases (95%) by day 28.
Conclusions
Underlying diseases were found to have a considerable role in the death of patients suffering from blood culture-positive sepsis in an ED of a developed country, as only 16% of the deaths by day 90 occurred where death was sepsis-related and the patient had a life-expectancy of more than 6 months. Improving the outcome of sepsis with new treatments is thus challenging. It is possible that day 7+day 28 mortality is a more appropriate endpoint than day 90 mortality when studying the outcome of sepsis, as this time-span includes most of the patients whose death was related to sepsis."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection is associated with neurological abnormalities, such as HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and peripheral neuropathy (PN). Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide, and causes PN in approximately 9% of patients. Because the interplay between these potentially neuropathogenic viruses in the same individual is still poorly understood, the clinical and laboratory outcomes of co-infected patients were evaluated and compared with those of controls.
Methods
The prevalence rates of neurological and laboratory abnormalities were evaluated in HCV/HTLV-1 co-infected patients (n=50), and in subjects with single HCV (n=46) or HTLV-1 (n=150) infection.
Results
A higher frequency of isolated PN was present in HCV-infected patients; this was not associated with cryoglobulinemia. No difference was found in the frequency of PN or HAM/TSP when co-infected subjects were compared to singly infected subjects. Hepatic involvement was present in HCV-infected subjects, as shown by increased levels of serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and bilirubin, in addition to thrombocytopenia. On the other hand, HCV/HTLV-1 co-infected individuals presented a better prognosis for hepatic involvement when compared with singly HCV-infected subjects.
Conclusions
These data suggest that HCV/HTLV-1 co-infection does not mutualistically alter the outcome with regard to neurological manifestations. Nonetheless, changes in the immunological environment induced by HTLV-1 infection could lead to a reduction in hepatic damage, even without significant HCV clearance."

The aim of this study was to dynamically investigate laboratory parameters and peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets in severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) patients at different stages, to evaluate the significance of these changes in the infection process and its influence on prognosis.
Methods
Case-control study was used in the research. Sixty-nine confirmed thrombocytopenia syndrome virus(SFTSV) infected patients were enrolled. They were divided into two groups, recovery group and poor prognosis group, according to the clinical prognosis of the diseases. The laboratory parameters were measured by matched fully-automatic detector. The dynamic lymphocyte subsets of each group were tested by flow cytometry. Independent-group Student’s t-test, Bonferroni test and Nemenyi test were used to compare the mean value of every group.
Results
The clinical manifestations typically became worse on about the 7th day. Most of them had multi organ dysfunction, and part of them had hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis histiocytosis (HLH). The characteristic laboratory findings in the early stage were the drop of platelets (PLT), while the increase of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate amino transferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). SFTSV viral loads reached the highest on Days 7–10 after onset of fever in SFTS patients. CD3+, CD3+CD4+ T cell counts were significantly reduced in poor prognosis group, more so on Days 7–10 after onset of fever. CD3–CD19+ (B cell) counts in SFTS patients were significantly higher than that of healthy controls. 11 days after illness onset, symptoms were improved, accompanied by resolution of laboratory abnormalities.
Conclusions
These results indicated that SFTS had an acute onset and self-limited course. It was a systemic infection. The host immune response caused tissues and organs injury. The improvement of symptoms and laboratory tests was consistent with the elimination of the virus and recover of immune response. Further investigation should be done in order to reveal the mechanisms of SFTSV pathogenesis and guide the clinical treatment."

Background
In spite of the epidemiological transition, communicable diseases remain a public health problem and represent a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in developing countries. This study aimed to determine the crude and standardized prevalence rates of hospitalizations for communicable disease (HCD) and to assess trends in HCD by age and sex at a university hospital in Tunisia over a period of 12 years (2002–2013).
Methods
All cases of HCD from 2002 to 2013 in the university hospital departments were included. Data collected from the regional register of hospital morbidity were used. The discharge diagnoses were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10).
Results
HCD represented 17.45% of all hospitalizations during the study period (34 289/196 488; 95% confidence interval 17.28–17.62%). The median age at the time of admission was 31 years (interquartile range (IQR) 15–52 years). The median hospital length of stay (LOS) was 5days (IQR 3–9 days). The crude prevalence rate (CPR) was 5.41 per 1000 inhabitants. The CPR was highest among patients aged ≥65 years. The four communicable disease categories that represented 70% of all HCD were abdominal infection, skin infection, genitourinary infection, and lower respiratory tract infection. The majority of HCD decreased over time; however, there was a significant increase in HIV diseases, tuberculosis, and viral hepatitis.
Conclusion
This study provides evidence of the epidemiological transition, showing a decline in communicable diseases, which needs to be sustained and improved."

This study sought to establish a HLA-A02 specific CTL cell culture method with comparison of the effects of different cytokines used in CTL cultivation to decide the best cultivation environment. In order to produce CTLs with targeted HLA-A02 restricted antigen specificity for adoptive cellular therapy, we evaluated autologous PBMC cultivation in different cytokine environment to select a better expansion condition to produce qualified CTL production.
Methods
We co-cultivated PBMC and peptides of these patients with HLA-A02 allele with different cytokines. After cultivation, multiple parameters were tested.
Results
1) Cytokines IL-2 alone can effectively amplify HLA-A02 specific CTL cells, and the count of CTLs was >85% all through the process. 2) The HLA-A02 specific cells at the end of the cultivation were mainly CD3+CD8+ cells. 3) The interferon stimulation test had shown that the expanded CTLs secreted more IFN-γ than before cultivation (0.9% -11.70%).

abstract = "Objective
Introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) targeted against a limited number of serotypes substantially decreased invasive (IPD) and non-invasive pneumococcal diseases (NIPD) but it was accompanied by non-vaccine type replacement disease. After 9 years of introduction of PCV in Mexico, we analyze the evidence of the indirect effects on IPD and NIPD serotype distribution among groups not targeted to receive the vaccine.
Methods
From January 2000 to December 2014, pneumococcal strains isolated from IPD and NIPD cases from patients ≥5 years of age from participant hospitals of the SIREVA II (Sistema Regional de Vacunas) network were serotyped. A regression analysis was performed considering year and proportion of serotypes included in the different vaccine formulations (PCV7, PCV10 and PCV13). The slope was obtained for each regression line and their correspondent p-value. The proportion of each serotype in the pre-PCV7 and post-PCV7 periods was evaluated by χ2 test.
Results
From a total of 1147 pneumococcal strains recovered, 570 corresponded to the pre-PCV7 and 577 to the post-PCV7 periods. The proportion of vaccine serotypes included in the three PCV formulations decreased by 2.4, 2.6 and 1.3%, respectively per year during the study period. A significant increase of serotype 19A was observed in the post-vaccine period in all age groups.
Conclusions
A percentage of annual decline of serotypes causing IPD and NIPD included in PCV was detected among groups not targeted to receive the vaccine, probably due to herd effect. Considering pneumococcal serotype distribution is a dynamic process, we highlight the importance of surveillance programs."

Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be a significant cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. An estimated 2 billion individuals are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and annually there are approximately 10 million new cases of clinical TB and 1.5 million deaths. Currently available drugs and vaccines have had no significant impact on TB control. In addition, the emergence of drug resistant TB is considered a public health crisis, with some strains now resistant to all available drugs. Unfortunately, the growing burden of antibiotic resistance is coupled with decreased effort in the development of new antibiotics. Natural sources are attractive starting points in the search for anti-tubercular drugs because they are extremely rich in chemical diversity and have privileged antimicrobial activity. This review will discuss recent advances in the development of TB drug leads from natural products, with a particular focus on anti-mycobacterial compounds in late-stage preclinical and clinical development."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The endocannabinoid system is involved in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. However, most of the findings in this area have come from experimental studies in animal models or clinical trials on chronic hepatitis C. The roles of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) in hepatofibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) have not been studied fully. This study aimed to explore the relationship between liver fibrosis and the expression of CB1 and CB2 in patients with CHB.
Methods
Eighty liver biopsy specimens from patients with CHB (52 male, 28 female) were analyzed in this study. Fibrosis was staged on a scale of 1 to 4 (F1 to F4, with F4 defining cirrhosis). There were 20 samples for each fibrosis stage. The expression of hepatic alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), CB1, and CB2 was detected by immunohistochemistry.
Results
Hepatic CB1 and CB2 were expressed in all patients with CHB. The degree of fibrosis was significantly associated with the increased expression of CB1 and CB2 in CHB. Furthermore a significant increase in cells positive for both CB1 and CB2 was detected in stage 3 and stage 4 disease compared to stage 1 and stage 2 disease. There was a strong positive association between CB1 expression and α-SMA expression. Moreover, double immunofluorescence staining for CB1 and α-SMA demonstrated that activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) express CB1.
Conclusions
The hepatic expression of CB1 and CB2 plays an important role during the progression of fibrosis induced by CHB. Endogenous activation of CB1 receptors in patients with CHB enhances fibrogenesis by direct effect on activated HSCs."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
The optimal antimicrobial treatment duration for patients with acute cholangitis with bacteremia remains unknown. The updated Tokyo Guidelines 2013 recommend a minimum duration of 2 weeks only when bacteremia with Gram-positive cocci is present. Since May 2013, a shorter antimicrobial treatment duration of under 2 weeks has been implemented at the authors’ institution for acute cholangitis with Gram-negative bacillary bacteremia. The aim of the present study was to validate this modified practice.
Methods
A single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted. The antimicrobial treatment duration, 30-day mortality rate, and recurrence rate within 3 months were compared between patients treated before May 2013 and after May 2013.
Results
Ninety-one patients with cholangitis with bacteremia were analyzed. The median antimicrobial treatment duration was 14.5days in patients treated before May 2013 and 10.0days after May 2013 (p <0.001). While the 30-day mortality rate did not differ significantly, the recurrence rate was higher in those treated before May 2013 (5.7% vs. 0.0%, p=0.17 and 13.3% vs. 0.0%, p=0.03, respectively). The median treatment duration after May 2013 was 8days for grade I patients, 10days for grade II patients, and 11.5days for grade III patients.
Conclusions
The results of this study suggest that acute cholangitis with Gram-negative bacillary bacteremia can be treated safely with a shorter antimicrobial treatment duration of <14 days."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
There has been a sustained and dramatic increase in community-acquired urinary tract infections (CA-UTI) caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria over recent years. Despite this, no studies have been performed in low- or middle-income countries. The main objective of this case–control study was to describe ESBL CA-UTI and its risk factors.
Methods
Outpatients with CA-UTI seen at the Hospital Cayetano Heredia during 2015 were identified. Patients were contacted by telephone. After consent had been obtained, a questionnaire concerning previously identified risk factors was applied. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted using Stata version 13.
Results
The overall frequency of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli was 40.85%. Sixty-seven cases and 105 controls were included in this study. The following main risk factors were identified on multivariate analysis: previous antibiotic use (odds ratio (OR) 3.09), previous hospitalization (OR 2.92), and previous surgery (OR 2.75). Chronic corticosteroid use (OR 24.32, 95% confidence interval 2.39–246.92) was also identified as a risk factor.
Conclusions
ESBL E. coli accounted for more than 40% of CA-UTIs during 2015. A history of previous hospitalization, surgery, and antibiotic use should be considered when treating this type of infection. Action should be taken to confirm these worrisome results and avoid the major consequences for public health."

Objectives
To explore the serotype distribution and drug resistance patterns of invasive pneumococcal isolates from children under 5 years of age.
Methods
During a 32-month period, 585 clinical samples (including blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and synovial fluid) from children suspected of having meningitis, sepsis, pneumonia, or septic arthritis were analyzed using the BACTEC culture system. Positive cultures were examined using biochemical tests and lytA amplification for the identification of pneumococcal strains. The confirmed pneumococcal isolates were examined to determine capsular types using a modified sequential multiplex PCR and susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.
Results
Fifty-three pneumococcal isolates were detected in the 585 clinical samples: 21 (39.6%) blood samples and 32 (60.4%) CSF samples. The most frequent serotype was 23F (24.5%), followed by serotypes 19F (18.9%), 19A (7.5%), and 9V (7.5%). Twenty-one percent of pneumococcal isolates were penicillin-non-susceptible and serotype 19A was significantly associated with resistance to penicillin.
Conclusions
This study indicated that the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) could cover the majority of the invasive pneumococcal isolates. Drug-resistant and multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains are circulating in Iran. Therefore, public immunization of infants using PCV13 is recommended to reduce the incidence of pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal-resistant strains in Teheran."

Methods
From March to July 2014 inclusive, all patients with suspicion of EV-A71 infection presenting to Kantha Bopha Hospitals in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap and confirmed by the Virology Unit at the Institut Pasteur du Cambodge were prospectively enrolled in this study. Throat swabs, rectal swabs and serum samples were collected from all consecutive patients with suspected EV-A71 infection. In addition, CSF was also collected from patients with suspected EV-A71 associated encephalitis. A total of 122 patients (29 with uncomplicated disease and 93 with severe disease) with confirmed EV-A71 infection with all available demographic and clinical data for clinical classification and further analysis were included in the study.
Results
In this prospective EV-A71 study in Cambodia, we confirmed the previously reported association of male gender and absence of mouth or skin lesions with severe disease. We also highlighted the strong association of neutrophils in blood, but also in CSF in patients with pulmonary oedema. More importantly, we identified new putative nutrition-related risk factors for severe disease.
Conclusions
EV-A71 is an important cause of encephalitis in the Asia-Pacific region. Further studies to determine the risk factors associated with severe EV-A71 disease are needed."

Children suffer a huge burden of disease in tuberculosis (TB) endemic countries. This disease burden was largely invisible when TB control programmes focused exclusively on adults with sputum smear-positive disease. High-level advocacy and better data have improved visibility, but the establishment of functional paediatric TB programmes remains challenging. The key issues that limit children's access to TB preventive therapy and treatment in endemic areas are briefly discussed. Barriers to preventive therapy include (1) the perceived inability to rule out active disease, (2) fear of creating drug resistance, (3) non-implementation of existing guidelines in the absence of adequate monitoring, and (4) poor adherence with long preventive therapy courses. Barriers to TB treatment include (1) perceived diagnostic difficulties, (2) non-availability of chest radiography, (3) young children presenting to unprepared maternal and child health (MCH) services, and (4) the absence of child-friendly formulations. With drug-resistant disease there is currently no guidance on the use of preventive therapy and treatment is usually restricted to cases with bacteriologically confirmed disease, which excludes most young children from care, even if their likely source case has documented drug-resistant TB."

Timely Schistosoma japonicum detection improves outcomes in schistosomiasis. Here, we established a double antibody sandwich ELISA to detect Schistosoma japonicum.
Methods
Sj29 polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were developed and identified. A Sj29 double antibody sandwich ELISA was evaluated.
Results
Assay sensitivity for detecting Schistosoma japonicum circulating antigen Sj29 was 76.7% (23/30), 54.5% (18/33) and 50.0% (18/36) in patients with acute, chronic and advanced schistosomiasis. No false positives or cross-reactivity was observed in healthy controls or patients with clonorchiasis, paragonimiasis, or ancylostomiasis, respectively. By contrast, false positives (5.7%) and cross-reactivity (6.5%–10%) were detected using an AWA-ELISA. The circulating antigen positive rates decreased significantly faster than that of the antibody detection after 6 months treatment (22.2%, 4/18 and 88.9%, 16/18). Chi-Square Tests revealed that Sj29 sandwich ELISA had lower sensitivity than AWA indirect ELISA in the detection of S. japonicum infected patients (p<0.05). Although our assay detection specificity in patients infected with other parasites or healthy controls appeared higher, the difference between the assays was insignificant. However, our assay showed significantly better results in monitoring praziquantel therapeutic effects (p=0.001), with antigen-positive rates decreasing significantly faster than antibody detection rates after 6 months of treatment (22.2%, 4/18 versus 88.9%, 16/18).
Conclusions
Sj29 double antibody sandwich ELISA was established. The specificity of this method for detecting healthy sera was 100%. Meanwhile, Sj29 sandwich ELISA may have a potential diagnostic capability to distinguish current from past infections and assess drug treatment responses."

Subclinical (asymptomatic) cases of malaria could be a major barrier to the success of malaria elimination programs. This study has evaluated the impact of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) on the prevalence of subclinical malaria in the presence of pyrethroid resistance in the main malaria vector Anopheles culicifacies on malaria transmission among a cohort of children in villages of the Keshkal sub-district in Chhattisgarh state.
Methods
A cohort of 6582 children ages less than 14 years was enrolled from 80 study clusters. Post monsoon survey was carried out at baseline before LLIN distribution, and 5862 children were followed up in the subsequent year. Study outcomes included assessment of subclinical malarial infections and use of LLINs among the study cohort in the presence of varied levels of pyrethroid resistance.
Findings
In the baseline survey, the proportion of subclinical malaria was 6·1%. LLIN use during the previous night was 94·8%. Overall, prevalence of subclinical malaria was significantly reduced to 1% (p<0·001) in the second survey. LLIN users were protected from malaria (OR: 0·25, 95% CI=0·12–0·52, p<0.001) and subclinical malaria (OR: 0·25, 95% CI=0·11–0·58, p=0·001) despite the presence of pyrethroid resistance in the study area.
Interpretation
In this low transmission area, sleeping under LLINs significantly reduced the burden of malaria among children. In the presence of pyrethroid resistant malaria vector, a high LLIN use of 94·5% was observed to have significantly brought down the proportion of subclinical malaria among the cohort children."

Objectives
Vancomycin is the treatment of choice for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia; however, its use has been subject to scrutiny due to failure in severe infections. Ceftaroline fosamil (CPT-F) is approved for MRSA acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, but not for bloodstream infections. The clinical outcomes of treatment with CPT-F in patients with MRSA bacteremia were evaluated.
Methods
Patients diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan, USA, involving isolates with a vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration ≥1.0mg/l and susceptible in vitro to CPT-F, were systematically reviewed retrospectively. Ceftaroline fosamil-treated patients were matched with at least two vancomycin- and/or one daptomycin-treated control patient based on age-patients age 65 years or greater or less than 65 years of age. Outcomes evaluated included the duration of hospitalization, duration of therapy, adverse events, relapse, hospital readmission, and death.
Results
Thirty consecutive cases of MRSA bacteremia treated with CPT-F during the period May 2011 to June 2013 were identified; these patients were matched to 56 MRSA bacteremia patients treated with vancomycin and 46 MRSA bacteremia patients treated with daptomycin. The primary source of MRSA bacteremia in the cohort treated with CPT-F was endocarditis (n=7, 23%), skin/wound (n=9, 30%), and bone/joint (n=8, 27%). The MRSA bacteremia in those treated with CPT-F was community-acquired in 43% of cases, healthcare-associated in 43%, and hospital-acquired in 13%. The mean length of hospital stay for these patients was 22 days. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 13% (n=4) in CPT-F patients versus 24% (n=11) in daptomycin patients and 11% (n=6) in vancomycin patients (p=0.188).
Conclusions
CPT-F demonstrated comparable clinical outcomes in MRSA bacteremia patients compared with the other agents, especially as salvage therapy."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Dengue is an important public health problem worldwide. A vaccine has recently been licensed in some countries of Latin America and Asia. Recommendations for dengue vaccine introduction include endemicity and a high serological prevalence of dengue in the territories considering its introduction.
Methods
A community-based survey was conducted to estimate dengue seroprevalence and age-specific seroconversion rates in a community in Medellin, Colombia, using a dengue serological test (IgG indirect ELISA). Residents were selected at random and were first screened for dengue infection; they were then followed over 2.5 years.
Results
A total of 3684 individuals aged between 1 and 65 years participated in at least one survey. The overall dengue seroprevalence was 61%, and only 3.3% of seropositive subjects self-reported a past history of dengue. Among dengue virus (DENV)-naïve subjects with more than two visits (n=1002), the overall seroconversion rate was 8.7% (95% confidence interval 7.3–10.4) per 1000 person-months, over the study period. Overall, the mean age of DENV prevalent subjects was significantly higher than the mean age of seroconverted subjects. Specifically, DENV seropositivity over 70% was observed in participants over 21 years old. Serotype-specific plaque-reduction neutralization tests (PRNT) revealed that all four dengue serotypes were circulating, with DENV4 being most prevalent.
Conclusions
These laboratory-based findings could inform dengue vaccine decisions, as they provide age-specific seroprevalence and seroconversion data, evidencing permanent and ongoing dengue transmission in the study area. This study provides evidence for the existing rates of secondary and heterotypic responses, presenting a challenge that must be addressed adequately by the new vaccine candidates."

abstract = "Summary
Introduction
Pathogenic Leptospira is the causative agent of leptospirosis, a widely disseminated disease of human and veterinary concern. The development of vaccines that elicit cross-protective immunity through multiple leptospiral serovars has long been pursued. The aim of this study was to develop a novel chimeric multi-epitope fusion antigen, containing sequences of previously studied outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of Leptospira.
Methods
The chimeric protein was designed based on the amino acid sequences of the LigA, Mce, Lsa45, OmpL1, and LipL41 proteins, cloned into pAE vector, the protein expressed in Escherichia coli, and its immune response evaluated in the hamster infection model.
Results
The recombinant chimeric protein (rChi) was recognized by antibodies present in serum samples of confirmed cases of human leptospirosis and experimentally infected hamsters, demonstrating that the rChi protein participates in the immune response activation during infection. However, despite high antibody titers achieved when the rChi protein was administered with either Alhydrogel or Bordetella pertussis monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), only 50% of the hamsters were protected against infection.
Conclusions
Although a complete characterization of the immune response elicited by rChi/adjuvant in hamsters is required, it is believed that the construction of chimeric genes is an important attempt towards the generation of an effective vaccine against leptospirosis."

Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel bunyavirus, was discovered in rural areas of Central China in 2009.
Methods
A case-control study based on hospital data was applied to detect the potential risk sources for SFTS in SFTS-endemic counties in Hubei Province. Cases were defined as hospitalized SFTSV confirmed patients. Controls were randomly selected from non-SFTSV patients in the same hospital ward within 2 weeks of inclusion of the cases, and they were matched by age (+/− 5 years) and gender according to 1:2 matching condition.
Results
68 cases and 136 controls participated in this study. In multivariate analysis, “Contact with cattle tick” was the major risk source (Conditional Logistic Regression OR-MH=8.62, 95% CI=1.79-41.51), outdoor activities and working in weeds or hillside fields could increase risk of cattle tick contact and SFTS infection (Conditional Logistic Regression OR-MH=8.82, 95% CI=1.69-46.05, P value=0.01).
Conclusion
Our results suggested cattle might be dominant hosts in SFTS-endemic regions in Hubei Province, which provided clues to transmission mechanism of “vectors, host animals, and humans”, thus more effectively preventing and controlling the disease."

Objectives
No interventions have yet been implemented to improve antibiotic use on Aruba. In the Netherlands, the introduction of an antibiotic checklist resulted in more appropriate antibiotic use in nine hospitals. The aim of this study was to introduce the antibiotic checklist on Aruba, test its effectiveness, and evaluate the possibility of implementing this checklist outside the Netherlands.
Methods
The antibiotic checklist includes seven quality indicators (QIs) that define appropriate antibiotic use. It applies to adult patients with a suspected bacterial infection, treated with intravenous antibiotics. The primary endpoint was the QI sum score, calculated by the patient’s sum of performed checklist-items divided by the total number of QIs that applied to that specific patient. Outcomes before and after the introduction of the checklist were compared.
Results
The percentage of patients with a QI sum score ≥50% increased significantly during the intervention (n=173) compared to baseline (n=150) (odds ratio 3.67, p<0.001). However, performance did not improve on each individual QI. The checklist was used in 63.3% of the eligible patients.
Conclusions
The introduction of the antibiotic checklist increased appropriate antibiotic use on Aruba. Additional initiatives are necessary for further improvement per QI. These results suggest that the antibiotic checklist could be used internationally."

Background
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) represents a significant cause of morbidity and mortality globally. While sex workers may face elevated HCV risks through both drug and sexual pathways, incidence data among sex workers are severely lacking. HCV incidence and predictors of HCV seroconversion among women sex workers in Vancouver, BC were characterized in this study.
Methods
Questionnaire and serological data were drawn from a community-based cohort of women sex workers (2010–2014). Kaplan–Meier methods and Cox regression were used to model HCV incidence and predictors of time to HCV seroconversion.
Results
Among 759 sex workers, HCV prevalence was 42.7%. Among 292 baseline-seronegative sex workers, HCV incidence density was 3.84/100 person-years (PY), with higher rates among women using injection drugs (23.30/100 PY) and non-injection crack (6.27/100 PY), and those living with HIV (13.27/100 PY) or acute sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (5.10/100 PY). In Cox analyses adjusted for injection drug use, age (hazard ratio (HR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86–1.01), acute STI (HR 2.49, 95% CI 1.02–6.06), and non-injection crack use (HR 2.71, 95% CI 1.18–6.25) predicted time to HCV seroconversion.
Discussion
While HCV incidence was highest among women who inject drugs, STIs and the use of non-injection stimulants appear to be pathways to HCV infection, suggesting potential dual sexual/drug transmission. Integrated HCV services within sexual health and HIV/STI programs are recommended."

Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) play an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection. Pegylated interferon is the standard therapy for CHC patients in Asian countries. This study aimed to evaluate the frequency and function of Tregs in CHC patients receiving combination therapy.
Methods
CHC patients (n=30) who had elevated alanine aminotransferase and underwent combination therapy were included. Clinical data and Treg function were checked at baseline, 12 weeks after treatment, at the end of treatment, and at the end of 24 weeks of follow-up. Treg immunosuppressive activity was measured as the inhibition ratio of conventional T-cell proliferation.
Results
Treg-mediated immunosuppression was significantly lower during therapy than at baseline (baseline 44.45%; 12 weeks 18.41% (p=0.042); end of treatment 22.62% (p=0.036); end of follow-up 17.46% (p=0.003)). Treg-mediated immunosuppression was higher in patients with a sustained virological response (SVR) than in those without SVR at the end of follow-up (SVR 24.20%, non-SVR 6.87%; p=0.030).
Conclusion
Treg-mediated immunosuppression was lower during and after combination therapy, regardless of the treatment response, and higher in patients with SVR than in those without SVR at the end of follow-up."

Background
Infrared thermography (IRT) is used to screen febrile passengers at international airports, but it suffers from low sensitivity. This study explored the application of a combined visible and thermal image processing approach that uses a CMOS camera equipped with IRT to remotely sense multiple vital signs and screen patients with suspected infectious diseases.
Methods
An IRT system that produced visible and thermal images was used for image acquisition. The subjects’ respiration rates were measured by monitoring temperature changes around the nasal areas on thermal images; facial skin temperatures were measured simultaneously. Facial blood circulation causes tiny color changes in visible facial images that enable the determination of the heart rate. A logistic regression discriminant function predicted the likelihood of infection within 10s, based on the measured vital signs. Sixteen patients with an influenza-like illness and 22 control subjects participated in a clinical test at a clinic in Fukushima, Japan.
Results
The vital-sign-based IRT screening system had a sensitivity of 87.5% and a negative predictive value of 91.7%; these values are higher than those of conventional fever-based screening approaches.
Conclusions
Multiple vital-sign-based screening efficiently detected patients with suspected infectious diseases. It offers a promising alternative to conventional fever-based screening."

Background
Understanding of humoral immune responses in tuberculosis (TB) is gaining interest, since B-cells and antibodies may be important in diagnosis as well as protective immune responses. High-content peptide microarrays (HCPM) are highly precise and reliable for gauging specific antibody responses to pathogens, as well as autoantigens.
Methods
An HCPM comprising epitopes spanning 154 proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was used to gauge specific IgG antibody responses in sera of TB patients from Africa and South America. Open source software for general access to this method is provided.
Results
The IgG response pattern of TB patients differs from that of healthy individuals, with the molecular complexity of the antigens influencing the strength of recognition. South American individuals with or without TB exhibited a generally stronger serum IgG response to the tested M. tuberculosis antigens compared to their African counterparts. Individual M. tuberculosis peptide targets were defined, segregating patients with TB from Africa versus those from South America.
Conclusions
These data reveal the heterogeneity of epitope-dependent humoral immune responses in TB patients, partly due to geographical setting. These findings expose a new avenue for mining clinically meaningful vaccine targets, diagnostic tools, and the development of immunotherapeutics in TB disease management or prevention."

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major health problem in low- and middle-income countries, and in many of these countries, the burden of non-communicable diseases such as hypertension is rising. Knowledge about how these diseases influence each other is limited.
Methods
A systematic review of the literature was performed to evaluate the evidence for an association between hypertension and TB.
Results
Three retrospective cohort studies, three case–control studies, eight cross-sectional studies, 12 case series, and 20 case reports exploring the association between hypertension and TB were included in the review. One cohort study found a significantly higher prevalence of hypertension among TB patients compared to controls. Cross-sectional studies reported a prevalence of hypertension in TB patients ranging from 0.7% to 38.3%. No studies were designed to assess whether hypertension is a risk factor for developing active TB.
Conclusions
Overall, no evidence was found to support an association between TB and hypertension; however, the results of this review must be interpreted with caution due to the lack of properly designed studies."

To investigate PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway changes and the proliferation of FoxP3+Treg cells in patients with active tuberculosis.
Methods
We isolated PBMCs and CD4+CD25+FoxP3+Treg cells from peripheral blood collected from patients with active tuberculosis and healthy controls. We compared the proportion and MFI of PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway components and PTEN by flow cytometry using specific cell-surface and intracellular markers. Moreover, we detected the specific secretory proteins ESAT-6 and Ag85B, cytokines IL-10, TGF-β1 and IL-35 in serum by ELISA.
Results
Compared with healthy controls, the proportions of CD3+Akt+, CD3+p-Akt+, CD3+mTOR+, CD3+p-mTOR+ and CD3+PTEN+ cells, in the T lymphocyte population of patients with active tuberculosis, were decreased (p<0.05), while CD3+FoxP3+ cells were increased (p=0.013). Similarly, for CD4+CD25+FoxP3+Treg cells, the proportions of Akt+ cells, p-Akt+ cells, mTOR+ cells, p-mTOR+ cells and PTEN+ cells were decreased (p<0.05) in patients with active tuberculosis. Compared with healthy controls, the levels of ESAT-6 and Ag85B were higher in patients with active tuberculosis (p<0.001). Levels of IL-10 and TGF-β1 were higher (p<0.001), whereas the level of IL-35 was lower (p<0.001).

Objectives
Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a threat to tuberculosis (TB) control. To guide TB control, it is essential to understand the extent to which and the circumstances in which MDR-TB will replace drug-susceptible TB (DS-TB) as the dominant phenotype. The issue was examined by assessing evidence from genomics, pharmacokinetics, and epidemiology studies. This evidence was then synthesized into a mathematical model.
Methods
This model considers two TB strains, one with and one without an MDR phenotype. It was considered that intrinsic transmissibility may be different between the two strains, as may the control response including the detection, treatment failure, and default rates. The outcomes were explored in terms of the incidence of MDR-TB and time until MDR-TB surpasses DS-TB as the dominant strain.
Results and conclusions
The ability of MDR-TB to dominate DS-TB was highly sensitive to the relative transmissibility of the resistant strain; however, MDR-TB could dominate even when its transmissibility was modestly reduced (to between 50% and 100% as transmissible as the DS-TB strain). This model suggests that it may take decades or more for strain replacement to occur. It was also found that while the amplification of resistance is the early cause of MDR-TB, this will rapidly give way to person-to-person transmission."

The 6-exon-spanning ‘canonical’ Interleukin-7 (IL-7c) is a non-redundant cytokine in human T-cell homeostasis that undergoes extensive alternative pre-mRNA splicing. The IL-7 gene variant lacking, exon 5 (IL-7δ5), exhibits agonistic effects as compared to IL-7c. We studied in this report for the first time the protein expression of IL-7δ5 variant in tissues and its role in monocyte activation.
Methods
We visualized the expression of IL-7δ5 protein by immunohistochemistry in both healthy and malignant (human) tissues and investigated the impact of IL-7δ5 stimulation on CD14+ monocytes using gene expression analysis and flow cytometry.
Results
IL-7δ5 is largely expressed by human epithelial cells, yet also by stromal cells in malignant lesions. Gene expression analysis in CD14+ monocytes, induced by the 6-exon spanning IL-7 or IL-7δ5 showed similar changes resulting in a pro-inflammatory phenotype and increased expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism. IL7δ5 was superior in inducing upregulation of the oxidised low density lipoprotein receptor (OLR), measured by flow cytometry, in CD14+ cells.
Conclusion
IL-7δ5, produced from non-transformed and transformed cells, may contribute to chronic inflammatory responses and development of ‘foamy’ cells by increased OLR1 expression that mediates increased oxLDL uptake."

The convergence between tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes mellitus (DM) will represent a major public health challenge in the near future. DM increases the risk of developing TB by two to three times and also increases the risk of TB treatment failure, relapse, and death. The global prevalence of DM is predicted to rise significantly in the next two decades, particularly in some of the low- and middle-income countries with the highest TB burden. Migration may add further complexity to the effort to control the impact on TB of the growing DM pandemic. Migration may increase the risk of DM, although the magnitude of this association varies according to country of origin and ethnic group, due to genetic factors and lifestyle differences. Migrants with TB may have an increased prevalence of DM compared to the native population, and the risk of TB among persons with DM may be higher in migrants than in autochthonous populations. Screening for DM among migrants, screening migrants with DM for active and latent TB, and improving access to DM care, could contribute to mitigate the effects of DM on TB."

Objectives
This study aimed to investigate the disparities in pneumonia-specific under-five mortality rates (U5MRs) among and within three geographic regions in Mainland China from 1996 to 2015.
Methods
Data were obtained from the national Under-Five Child Mortality Surveillance System and grouped into 2-year periods. The Cochran–Armitage trend test and Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test were used to assess trends and differences in the pneumonia-specific U5MRs among and within geographic regions. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated.
Results
The pneumonia-specific U5MR decreased by 90.6%, 89.0%, and 83.5% in East, Middle, and West China, respectively, with a larger decrease in rural areas. The pneumonia-specific U5MR was highest in West China, and was 7.2 (95% CI 5.9–8.7) times higher than that in East China in 2014–2015. In 2014–2015, the RRs were 1.7 (95% CI 1.2–2.5), 1.6 (95% CI 1.1–2.1), and 3.4 (95% CI 2.8–4.0) between rural and urban areas in East, Middle, and West China, respectively.
Conclusions
Pneumonia-specific U5MRs decreased from 1996 to 2015 across China, particularly in rural areas. However, disparities remained among and within geographic regions. Additional strategies and interventions should be introduced in West China, especially the rural areas, to further reduce the pneumonia-specific U5MR."

Background
Hospitalized neonates are vulnerable to infection, with pathogen exposures occurring in utero, intrapartum, and postnatally. African neonatal units are at high risk of outbreaks owing to overcrowding, understaffing, and shared equipment.
Methods
Neonatal outbreaks attended by the paediatric infectious diseases and infection prevention (IP) teams at Tygerberg Children’s Hospital, Cape Town (May 1, 2008 to April 30, 2016) are described, pathogens, outbreak size, mortality, source, and outbreak control measures. Neonatal outbreaks reported from Africa (January 1, 1996 to January 1, 2016) were reviewed to contextualize the authors’ experience within the published literature from the region.
Results
Thirteen outbreaks affecting 148 babies (11 deaths; 7% mortality) over an 8-year period were documented, with pathogens including rotavirus, influenza virus, measles virus, and multidrug-resistant bacteria (Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci). Although the infection source was seldom identified, most outbreaks were associated with breaches in IP practices. Stringent transmission-based precautions, staff/parent education, and changes to clinical practices contained the outbreaks. From the African neonatal literature, 20 outbreaks affecting 524 babies (177 deaths; 34% mortality) were identified; 50% of outbreaks were caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae.
Conclusions
Outbreaks in hospitalized African neonates are frequent but under-reported, with high mortality and a predominance of Gram-negative bacteria. Breaches in IP practice are commonly implicated, with the outbreak source confirmed in less than 50% of cases. Programmes to improve IP practice and address antimicrobial resistance in African neonatal units are urgently required."

Objectives
There has been no review on the prevalence, possible causes, and clinical outcomes of self-medication with antibiotics (SMA) in the Middle East.
Methods
Databases were searched (January 2000 through June 2016) for articles on SMA among adults aged ≥18 years living in the Middle East. A hand search for relevant citations and key journals was also performed.
Results
Twenty-two studies were found. The prevalence of SMA ranged from 19% to 82%. Age, sex, and educational and income levels were the main determinants of SMA. Socio-cultural, economic, and regulatory factors were the most commonly cited reasons for SMA. Penicillins were the antibiotics most commonly used; the antibiotics were obtained mainly via stored leftover drugs, pharmacies without prescriptions, and friends/relatives. SMA was mainly for upper respiratory tract problems. The primary sources of drug information included relatives/friends and previous successful experience. Inappropriate drug use such as wrong indication, short and long duration of treatment, sharing of antibiotics, and storing antibiotics at home for use at a later time were reported. Negative and positive outcomes of SMA were identified.
Conclusions
It is important to understand the links between different factors promoting SMA and to assess the changing trends in order to derive strategies aimed at reducing drug-related health risks."

Our aim was to retrospectively compare clinical data and characteristics of removed lesions of the cohort of patients undergoing therapeutical surgery for their tuberculosis.
Design and methods
Demographic and epidemiological details, clinical data, data on the surgery performed, macroscopic characteristics of the TB lesions removed, and outcome were recorded retrospectively from the 137 patients who underwent therapeutical surgery for their TB in Tbilisi, Georgia during 2014 and 2015.
Results
Men represented 70% of the included patients, presented more comorbidities and underwent operation earlier in terms of days between diagnostic and surgery. Women underwent operation at younger ages, and in MDR/XDR-TB cases, showed higher percentages of sputum conversion at >2 months and of fresh necrosis in the surgical specimens, suggesting a worse evolution. Half of cases were MDR/XDR-TB cases. In spite of being considered microbiologically cured according to WHO, a non despricable percentage of cases showed viable bacilli in the surgical specimen. Even if no causality could be statistically demonstrated, differences could be encountered according to gender and drug susceptibility of the responsible strains.
Conclusions
According to our results, host factors such as gender, type of necrosis found in the lesions, size of lesions and presence of viable bacilli in the surgical specimen, should be included in future studies on therapeutical surgery of TB. As most of studies are done in MDR/XDR-TB, more data on DS-TB operated cases are needed. Our results also highlight that, in spite of achieving the microbiologically cured status, sterilization might not occur, and thus new biomarkers and new methods to evaluate the healing process of TB patients are urgently needed and radiological assays should be taken into account."

Usually, this reduction is similar to that induced by BCG, although in some cases a weak but significant improvement can be detected, but none of candidates are able to prevent establishment of infection. The main characteristics of several laboratory animals are reviewed, reflecting that none are able to simulate the whole characteristics of human tuberculosis. As, so far, no surrogate of protection has been found, it is important to test new candidates in several models in order to generate convincing evidence of efficacy that might be better than that of BCG in humans. It is also important to investigate the use of “in silico” and “ex vivo” models to better understand experimental data and also to try to replace, or at least reduce and refine experimental models in animals."

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease of global public health importance caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. The disease has worsened with the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB strains. The timely diagnosis and treatment of TB remains a key public health priority, and laboratories have a critical role in the rapid and accurate detection of TB and drug resistance. Molecular assays based on nucleic acid amplification techniques have been developed for the rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnosis of TB, with the ability to determine the drug sensitivity status. These molecular techniques are now available or are being implemented in developing countries. However, traditional microscopy and culture methods cannot yet be replaced; the molecular assays can be applied in parallel with these tests for the diagnosis of TB or for drug susceptibility testing. Performing such molecular tests is often restricted by constraints with regard to sputum sample storage and safe transportation from remote health centres to central laboratories. Since smear slides are performed routinely for the diagnosis of TB in most TB diagnostic laboratories, they are readily available and could be the ideal tool to transport sputum for further molecular tests. The aim of this review was to provide a comprehensive survey on the use of smear slides for both TB diagnosis and the molecular test approach. Based on the literature, stained smear microscopy slides can be a safe system for the transportation of sputum specimens from remote health centres to reference TB laboratories for further molecular TB or MDR-TB detection, and could help in the rapid diagnosis and therefore timely management of TB patients."

abstract = "Summary
Background
To characterize the temporal dynamics of mumps epidemiology according to the different vaccine strains used, sex-specific trends were decomposed in an age–period–cohort (APC) analysis for mumps cases reported in South Korea.
Methods
National surveillance data were used to describe the epidemiology of mumps cases from 2001 to 2015. An APC model was used to break down the reported mumps cases into the effects of age, period, and birth cohort.
Results
From 2001 to 2015, the incidence started to increase from fewer than 10 cases to more than 100 cases per 100 000. The incidence rate was highest among males aged 15–17 years during 2013–2015, reaching 508.7 per 100 000 persons. There was an increased incidence during the late teenage years in the 1998–2000 cohort. An age shift towards the earlier teenage years was observed across the 2001–2003 and 2004–2006 cohorts. The risk of mumps increased according to the birth cohort; the net drift from 2001 to 2015 was 27.67 (95% confidence interval 27.5.47–29.90) for males and 27.25 (95% confidence interval 24.91–29.65) for females.
Conclusions
The increase in mumps seen in Korea may have been affected by the birth cohort exposed to the Rubini strain; however other factors may have contributed to the increase in non-exposed cohorts."

Objectives
An epidemic of Ross River virus (RRV) occurred in the South Pacific in 1979–1980, but RRV has not been thought to occur endemically outside Australia and Papua New Guinea. A seroprevalence study was conducted to determine whether RRV has circulated in American Samoa since 1980.
Methods
RRV ELISA IgG was performed on 200 serum samples collected in American Samoa in 2010; seroneutralization tests were performed on 60 representative samples.
Results
Of 196 available ELISA IgG results, 145 (74%, 95% confidence interval 67–80%) were seropositive. Of the 60 samples subjected to seroneutralization testing, none of the 15 ELISA IgG-negative and 16 of the 45 ELISA IgG-positive samples neutralized RRV. ELISA IgG seroprevalence was higher in persons born before/during the 1979–1980 RRV outbreak (78.3%), but was also high (63.0%) in people born after the outbreak who had lived their entire lives in American Samoa.
Conclusions
This study provides serological evidence that RRV circulation is likely to have occurred in American Samoa after 1980. Considering there are no marsupials in American Samoa, this finding implies that other species are capable of acting as reservoir hosts and indicates the potential for RRV to circulate in a much wider area than those currently recognized."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The early detection of infectious disease outbreaks can reduce the ultimate size of the outbreak, with lower overall morbidity and mortality due to the disease. Numerous approaches to the earlier detection of outbreaks exist, and methods have been developed to measure progress on timeliness. Understanding why these surveillance approaches work and do not work will elucidate key drivers of early detection, and could guide interventions to achieve earlier detection. Without clarity about the conditions necessary for earlier detection and the factors influencing these, attempts to improve surveillance will be ad hoc and unsystematic.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted using the PRISMA framework (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) to identify research published between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2015 in the English language. The MEDLINE (PubMed) database was searched. Influencing factors were organized according to a generic five-step infectious disease detection model.
Results
Five studies were identified and included in the review. These studies evaluated the effect of electronic-based reporting on detection timeliness, impact of laboratory agreements on timeliness, and barriers to notification by general practitioners. Findings were categorized as conditions necessary for earlier detection and factors that influence whether or not these conditions can be in place, and were organized according to the detection model. There is some evidence on reporting, no evidence on assessment, and speculation about local level recognition.
Conclusion
Despite significant investment in early outbreak detection, there is very little evidence with respect to factors that influence earlier detection. More research is needed to guide intervention planning."

Background
Developing human resources capacity is vital for tuberculosis (TB) control in low- and middle-income countries. Although investments in TB healthcare provider (HCP) training programmes have increased, it is unclear whether these are robustly evaluated. The objective of this systematic review was to synthesize the methods and outcome indicators used to assess TB HCP training programmes.
Methods
A systematic scoping review of publications reporting on evaluations of training programmes for TB HCPs – including doctors, nurses, paramedics, and lay health workers – was conducted through a search in three electronic databases, Google Scholar, and five websites of non-profit organizations. Data on the study location, population trained, outcomes assessed, and evaluation approach were extracted.
Results
After screening 499 unique publications, 21 were eligible for inclusion in the analysis. The majority of evaluations were conducted in Africa. The most common evaluation methods were a review of patient records (n=8, 38%) and post-training interview with trainees (n=7, 33%). In terms of outcomes, more than half of the studies (n=12, 57%) evaluated knowledge acquisition of trainees, with only six (29%) assessing on-the-job behaviour change.
Conclusions
Even though more funds have been invested in TB HCP training, publications from robust evaluations assessing the impact on quality of care and behaviour change are limited."

Background
Leishmaniasis is one of the neglected infectious diseases of the world. This disease largely affects individuals of low socio-economic level, mainly in developing countries.
Methods
The aim of this study was to investigate the cumulative number of cases, case fatality rate, and trend in incidence and mortality rate of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Eastern Sudan. A retrospective descriptive study was performed through analysis of the database managed by the Ministry of Health in Gadarif State, which includes all cases of VL.
Results
Over the 14-year study period (2002–2015), a total of 51773 patients were registered in Gadarif State with clinical and laboratory evidence of proven VL. The trend in VL was considerably higher over the years 2003–2005 as compared to the last 5 years of 2011–2015. The highest fatality rate was observed in 2002 (4.8%) and it had declined in 2014 (1.1%) and 2015 (1.7%). Rural residence was statistically associated with death related to VL (p=0.021).
Conclusions
This study showed a high number of cumulative cases of VL in Eastern Sudan. The fatality rate was found to be highest among rural residents and has declined in the last 5 years. Thus immediate interventions are needed in terms of health education and the implementation of preventive measures, with a specific focus on people residing in rural areas."

Objective
To determine and describe the factors influencing treatment default of tuberculosis (TB) patients in the Free State Province of South Africa.
Methods
A retrospective records review of pulmonary TB cases captured in the ETR.Net electronic TB register between 2003 and 2012 was performed. Subjects were >15 years of age and had a recorded pre-treatment smear result. The demographic and clinical characteristics of defaulters were described. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with treatment default. The odds ratios (OR) together with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Statistical significance was considered at 0.05.
Results
A total of 7980 out of 110 349 (7.2%) cases defaulted treatment. Significantly higher proportions of cases were male (8.3% vs. female: 5.8%; p<0.001), <25 years old (9.1% vs. 25–34 years: 8.7%; 35–44 years: 7.0%; 45–54 years: 5.2%; 55–64 years: 4.4%; >64 years: 3.9%; p<0.001), undergoing TB retreatment (11.0% vs. new cases: 6.3%; p<0.001), had a negative pre-treatment sputum smear result (7.8% vs. positive smear results: 7.1%; p<0.001), were in the first 2 months of treatment (95.5% vs. >2 months: 4.8%; p<0.001), and had unknown HIV status (7.8% vs. HIV-positive: 7.0% and HIV-negative: 5.7%; p<0.001). After controlling for potential confounders, multivariate analysis revealed a two-fold increased risk of defaulting treatment when being retreated compared to being treated for the first time for TB (adjusted OR (AOR) 2.0, 95% CI 1.85–2.25). Female cases were 40% less likely to default treatment compared to their male counterparts (AOR 0.6, 95% CI 0.51–0.71). Treatment default was less likely among cases >24 years old compared to younger cases (25–34 years: AOR 0.8, 95% CI 0.77–0.87; 35–44 years: AOR 0.6, 95% CI 0.50–0.64; 45–54 years: AOR 0.4, 95% CI 0.32–0.49; 55–64 years: AOR 0.3, 95% CI 0.21–0.43; >64 years: AOR 0.3, 95% CI 0.19–0.35). Co-infected cases receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) were 40% less likely to default TB treatment relative to those whose ART status was unknown (AOR 0.6, 95% CI 0.46–0.57).
Conclusions
Salient factors influence TB patient treatment default in the Free State Province. Therefore, the strengthening of clinical and programmatic interventions for patients at high risk of treatment default is recommended. In particular, ART provision to co-infected cases facilitates TB treatment adherence and outcomes."

Theoretical investigations predicting the epidemic curves of seasonal influenza have been demonstrated so far; however, there is little empirical research using ever accumulated epidemic curves. The effects of vaccine coverage and information distribution on influenza epidemics were evaluated.
Materials and Methods
Four indices for epidemics (i.e., onset-peak duration, onset-end duration, ratio of the onset-peak duration to onset-end duration and steepness of epidemic curves) were defined, and the correlations between these indices and anti-flu drug prescription dose, vaccine coverage, the volume of media and search trend on influenza through internet were analyzed. Epidemiological data on seasonal influenza epidemics from 2002/2003 to 2013/2014 excluding 2009/2010 season were collected from National Institute of Infectious Diseases of Japan.
Results
The onset-peak duration and its ratio to onset-end duration correlated inversely with the volume of anti-flu drug prescription. Onset-peak duration correlated positively with media information volume on influenza. The steepness of the epidemic curve, and anti-flu drug prescription dose inversely correlated with the volume of media information. Pre-epidemic search trend and media volume on influenza correlated with the vaccine coverage in the season. Vaccine coverage had no strong effect on epidemic curve.
Conclusion
Education through media has an effect on the epidemic curve of seasonal influenza."

A case of disseminated nocardiosis caused by Nocardia elegans in a 72-year-old man with rheumatoid arthritis, treated with tacrolimus and prednisolone, is reported herein. The patient had impaired vision and was diagnosed with endophthalmitis and an abdominal skin abscess. He was started on trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole treatment, followed by cefepime. The patient was then switched to a combination of imipenem–cilastatin and minocycline. Although the patient survived as a result of surgery and prolonged antibiotic treatment, he eventually lost vision after the infection became resistant to antibiotic treatment. Molecular analysis of samples from the abscess and vitreous fluid confirmed the extremely rare pathogen N. elegans, which accounts for only 0.3–0.6% of infections caused by Nocardia species. This organism is almost always associated with pulmonary infection, and disseminated infections are rare. As with previously reported norcardial infections, the current case was treated successfully with trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, carbapenems, and aminoglycosides. However, the clinical characteristics of this organism remain unclear. Further studies are therefore required to develop more effective treatment protocols for disseminated nocardiosis caused by this problematic pathogen."

Non-albicans Candida (NAC) spp. in immunocompromised patients are linked to invasive infections with narrow treatment choice. This study aimed at comparing the oral colonization of NAC spp. between HIV and non-HIV infected individuals in Mwanza, Tanzania.
Method
Oral rinse of 351 HIV-infected and 639 non-HIV infected individuals were collected between March and July 2015. Phenotypic identifications of Candida spp. was done using Candida Chromogenic agar and confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS.
Results
NAC spp. were detected in 36/351 (10.3%) HIV-infected individuals compared to 28/639 (4.4%) of non-HIV infected individuals; P=0.0003. In HIV infected individuals, commonly isolated NAC spp. were Candida tropicalis, 10(2.8%), C. krusei (Issatschenki orientalis) 9(2.6%) and C. glabrata 8(2.3%). While for non-HIV infected individuals C. dubliniensis 8(1.3%) and C. tropicalis 5(0.9%) were commonly detected. As CD4 count/μl decreases by one unit the risk of being colonized by NAC spp. among HIV infected individuals increases by 1% (OR 1.01, 95% CI; 1.001-1.004, P=0.001).
Conclusion
The prevalence of NAC spp. is high among HIV-infected individuals with low CD4 count placing them at higher risk of invasive infections. Further studies to investigate the role of NAC spp. in causing invasive infections among immunocompromised patients are recommended."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
The recent emergence of Zika in Brazil and its association with an increased rate of congenital malformations has raised concerns over its impact on the birth rate in the country. Using data on the incidence of Zika in 2015–2016 and dengue in 2013 and 2015–2016 for the city of Rio de Janeiro (population 6.4 million), a massive increase of Zika in women compared to men was documented.
Methods
The age-adjusted incidence was compared between men and women. A negative binomial Poisson generalized linear model was fitted to the Zika incidence data to determine the significance of sexual transmission statistically.
Results
Even after correcting for the bias due to the systematic testing of pregnant women for Zika, there were found to be 90% more registered cases per 100000 women than men in the sexually active age group (15–65 years); this was not the case for age groups <15 years and >65 years. Assuming that infected men transmit the disease to women in their semen, but that the converse is not true, some extra incidence in women is to be expected. An alternate hypothesis would be that women visit doctors more often than men. To test this, the incidence of dengue fever was compared in men and women in 2015 and in 2013 (before Zika reached Rio de Janeiro): in both years, women were 30% more likely to be reported with dengue.
Conclusion
Women in the sexually active age group are far more likely to get Zika than men (+90% increase); sexual transmission is the most probable cause. Women in the 15–65 years age group are also 30% more likely to be reported with dengue than men, which is probably due to women being more careful with their health."

Advances in quantitative modeling and simulation can be used to maximize the utility of patient-level data from prior and contemporary clinical trials, thus optimizing study design for anti-TB regimens. This perspective article highlights the work of seven project teams developing first-in-class translational and quantitative methodologies that aim to inform drug development decision-making, dose selection, trial design, and safety assessments, in order to achieve shorter and safer therapies for patients in need. These tools offer the opportunity to evaluate multiple hypotheses and provide a means to identify, quantify, and understand relevant sources of variability, to optimize translation and clinical trial design.

Patients with tuberculosis (TB) often present with weight loss. Lack of weight gain with TB treatment has been associated with treatment failure. The purpose of this study was to examine patterns of weight gain in patients with TB and determine the disease characteristics that predict weight gain.
Methods
This was a retrospective cohort study of adults with TB treated in a county health system in the USA. Demographic, clinical, radiographic, and microbiological data were recorded in addition to monthly weights during treatment.
Results
Overall, patients had a significant change in weight over the course of treatment (p<0.0001). After 2 months of treatment, 31.9% of patients had gained at least 5% body weight; by the end of treatment, 62.4% of patients had gained at least 5% weight. Patients who gained weight did so in a linear fashion throughout treatment. Cavitary and extensive disease, a positive smear, and a positive culture were predictors of weight gain (p<0.05). No patients had relapses during the time period of the study.
Conclusions
Only a subset of patients treated for TB gain significant weight. A greater burden of disease was predictive of weight gain."

The classification of anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs is important as it helps the clinician to build an appropriate anti-TB regimen for multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB cases that do not fulfil the criteria for the shorter MDR-TB regimen. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently approved a revision of the classification of new anti-TB drugs based on current evidence on each drug. In the previous WHO guidelines, the choice of drugs was based on efficacy and toxicity in a step-down manner, from group 1 first-line drugs and groups 2–5 second-line drugs, to group 5 drugs with potentially limited efficacy or limited clinical evidence. In the revised WHO classification, exclusively aimed at managing drug-resistant cases, medicines are again listed in hierarchical order from group A to group D. In parallel, a possible future classification is independently proposed. The aim of this viewpoint article is to describe the evolution in WHO TB classification (taking into account an independently proposed new classification) and recent changes in WHO guidance, while commenting on the differences between them. The latest evidence on the ex-group 5 drugs is also discussed."

Moreover, virulence evolution makes M. morganii an important pathogen. Accumulated data have demonstrated that M. morganii can cause various infections, such as sepsis, abscess, purple urine bag syndrome, chorioamnionitis, and cellulitis. This bacterium often results in a high mortality rate in patients with some infections. M. morganii is considered as a non-negligent opportunistic pathogen because of the increased levels of resistance and virulence.

In spite of the recent introduction of two new drugs (delamanid and bedaquiline) and a few repurposed compounds to treat multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR- and XDR-TB), clinicians are facing increasing problems in designing effective regimens in severe cases. Recently a 9 to 12-month regimen (known as the ‘Bangladesh regimen’) proved to be effective in treating MDR-TB cases. It included an initial phase of 4 to 6 months of kanamycin, moxifloxacin, prothionamide, clofazimine, pyrazinamide, high-dose isoniazid, and ethambutol, followed by 5 months of moxifloxacin, clofazimine, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. However, recent evidence from Europe and Latin America identified prevalences of resistance to the first-line drugs in this regimen (ethambutol and pyrazinamide) exceeding 60%, and of prothionamide exceeding 50%. Furthermore, the proportions of resistance to the two most important pillars of the regimen – quinolones and kanamycin – were higher than 40%. Overall, only 14 out of 348 adult patients (4.0%) were susceptible to all of the drugs composing the regimen, and were therefore potentially suitable for the ‘shorter regimen’. A shorter, cheaper, and well-tolerated MDR-TB regimen is likely to impact the number of patients treated and improve adherence if prescribed to the right patients through the systematic use of rapid MTBDRsl testing."

Background
As part of the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) we report antimicrobial resistance among Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates collected globally from integumentary sources between 2010 and 2014.
Methods
Minimum inhibitory concentrations and antimicrobial resistance were determined according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines (US Food and Drug Administration breakpoints against tigecycline). The Cochran–Armitage trend test was used to identify statistically significant changes in resistance.
Results
Global rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii were 38% and 43%, respectively. No S. aureus isolates were resistant to linezolid or vancomycin; all isolates were susceptible to tigecycline. Two percent of Enterococcus faecalis and 28% of Enterococcus faecium were vancomycin-resistant. Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producers accounted for 22% of Klebsiella pneumoniae and 16% of Escherichia coli. Resistance to minocycline among E. faecalis, E. faecium, K. pneumoniae, and E. coli decreased significantly (p<0.0001). There were significant increases (p<0.0001) in A. baumannii resistance to cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, meropenem, and piperacillin–tazobactam.
Conclusions
Among isolates from integumentary sources, rates of MRSA and ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae are stabilizing. Carbapenems and tigecycline have retained their in vitro activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Few agents were active against A. baumannii; its increasing resistance is cause for concern."

Objectives
Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a newly emerging infectious disease caused by a novel bunyavirus in which host immune system suppression is thought to be crucial in the development of disease. This study was designed to study the frequencies and activation status of dendritic cells (DCs) at different stages of SFTS and their association with disease severity.
Methods
All confirmed SFTS patients (N=115) were recruited from the Wuhan Union Hospital in 2015; routine laboratory parameters were collected. The frequencies, phenotypes, and subsets of circulating DCs, including myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (mDCs and pDCs), were analyzed by flow cytometry. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were detected by ELISA. The laboratory parameters and other clinical events related to mortality were assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.
Results
The frequency of circulating mDCs, especially from day 9 after disease onset, could serve as a valuable prognostic biomarker for the outcome in SFTS patients (area under the curve=0.929, p<0.0001). In addition, persistent down-regulation of the co-stimulatory molecules CD80/CD86 on the mDCs was observed during the disease process. Moreover, levels of mDCs were inversely correlated with the production of IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α and with viral load at admission.
Conclusions
The present results indicate that DCs might be functionally impaired in SFTS. A decreased level of circulating mDCs was closely correlated with the severity of SFTS."

Objectives
Neisseria meningitidis is the major cause of seasonal meningitis epidemics in the African meningitis belt. In the changing context of a reduction in incidence of serogroup A and an increase in incidence of serogroups W and C and of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a better understanding of the determinants driving the disease transmission dynamics remains crucial to improving bacterial meningitis control.
Methods
The literature was searched to provide a multi-disciplinary overview of the determinants of meningitis transmission dynamics in the African meningitis belt.
Results
Seasonal hyperendemicity is likely predominantly caused by increased invasion rates, sporadic localized epidemics by increased transmission rates, and larger pluri-annual epidemic waves by changing population immunity. Carriage likely involves competition for colonization and cross-immunity. The duration of immunity likely depends on the acquisition type. Major risk factors include dust and low humidity, and presumably human contact rates and co-infections; social studies highlighted environmental and dietary factors, with supernatural explanations.
Conclusions
Efforts should focus on implementing multi-country, longitudinal seroprevalence and epidemiological studies, validating immune markers of protection, and improving surveillance, including more systematic molecular characterizations of the bacteria. Integrating climate and social factors into disease control strategies represents a high priority for optimizing the public health response and anticipating the geographic evolution of the African meningitis belt."

Objectives
Most are aware of pneumococcal infection as a complication of splenectomy and the increased risk of severe invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in asplenic patients. However little is known of the current status of this entity in a population with an active pneumococcal conjugate vaccine program for children.
Methods
All IPD cases reported from 2000 to 2014 in Northern Alberta, Canada were collected prospectively. Socio-demographic variables, clinical characteristics, and IPD-related outcomes were compared between patients with and without a spleen using the Student t-test, Chi-square test, or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate.
Results
Thirty-seven of 2435 patients with IPD (1.5%) were asplenic. Asplenic patients were significantly more likely to require mechanical ventilation or admission to the intensive care unit and had more complications (e.g., acute kidney injury). However, in-hospital mortality rates were similar in those with and without a spleen (19% vs. 16%, p=0.58). Pneumococcal serotype 22B was 33-fold higher in asplenic patients compared to those with a spleen.
Conclusions
In patients with IPD, those who are asplenic have a more severe infection than those with a spleen; however, the mortality rate is not significantly different. The reason for the predominance of serotype 22B requires further investigation and if replicated may warrant attention to current vaccination strategies."

A cross sectional study was conducted among sputum smear positive index TB cases and their household contacts in Northern Ethiopia.
Results
Of 353 contacts screened, 41 (11%) were found to have presumptive TB. GeneXpert test done among 39 presumptive TB cases diagnosed 14 (35.9%) cases of TB (one being rifampicin resistant), whereas the number of TB cases diagnosed by microscopy was only 5 (12.8%): a 64.3% increased positivity rate by GeneXpert versus ZN microscopy. The number needed to screen and number needed to test to diagnose a single case of TB was significantly lower with the use of GeneXpert than ZN microscopy. Of 119 index TB cases, GeneXpert test revealed that 106 (89.1%) and 5 (4.2%) were positive for rifampicin sensitive and rifampicin resistant TB, respectively.
Conclusion
GeneXpert test led to increased TB case detection among household contacts in addition to its advantage in the diagnosis of Rifampicin resistance among contacts and index TB cases. There should be a consideration in using GeneXpert MTB/RIF as a point of care TB testing tool among high risk groups."

Objectives
The purpose of this study was to measure the prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) and the rates and factors associated with their over-treatment (OT) and under-treatment (UT).
Methods
A retrospective chart review was performed of patients aged 13–24 years who were screened for GC/CT in the emergency department (ED) of a public hospital. Descriptive statistics were obtained for all variables, and multivariate log binomial regression was performed to ascertain the factors associated with OT and UT.
Results
Seven hundred and ninety-seven adolescents and young adults were screened for GC/CT. The overall sexually transmitted infection (STI) positivity rate was 21.6%; 136 (21.6%) subjects were over-treated and 74 (43.4%) subjects were under-treated. Patients presenting with STI exposure or genito-urinary symptoms were more likely to be OT. Additionally, females aged 18–19 years or with a prior history of STIs were more likely to be OT. Females (83.6%) were more likely to be UT, while STI exposure, genito-urinary symptoms, and a prior history of STI were protective of UT .
Conclusion
Adolescents and young adults screened for STIs have a high prevalence of GC/CT. A significant proportion of these patients end up over-treated and an even higher proportion are under-treated."

Objective
Clostridium tertium is considered an uncommon pathogen in humans, but is a cause of bacteremia in patients with underlying hematological malignancies and neutropenia. A case series highlighting 10 years of experience with C. tertium as a cause of bacteremia in this population is presented; the cases were seen at a National Cancer Institute designated cancer center.
Methods
Institutional review board approval was obtained prior to the start of the study. All cases of C. tertium bacteremia seen at H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute from 2005 to 2015 were reviewed. The study population was identified by positive blood cultures obtained from the microbiology laboratory over the same time period.
Results
Seven patients were found to have had C. tertium bacteremia. These patients had a temperature of >38.3°C at the time of diagnosis and severe neutropenia. All patients had a history of hematological malignancy, five having acute myeloid leukemia and two having myelodysplastic syndrome. All of the patients’ blood cultures cleared within ≤3 days of antibiotic therapy.
Conclusions
The unusual susceptibility pattern of C. tertium, with resistance to beta-lactams and clindamycin, likely explains its presence in immunosuppressed patients. Vancomycin remains the drug of choice. The pathogen continues to have a low virulence and a low mortality when treated appropriately."

Ancient and historical tuberculosis (TB) can be recognized by its typical paleopathology in human remains. Using paleomicrobiology, it is possible to detect many more individuals infected with TB but with no visible lesions. Due to advances in molecular analysis over the past two decades, it is clear that TB was widespread in humans from the Neolithic period and has remained so until the present day. Past human populations were associated with different lineages of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, thereby elucidating early human migrations. Using paleomicrobiology, it is possible to detect individuals infected with TB who are also co-infected with other bacteria or parasites. TB is also found in hosts with co-morbidities such as neoplasms, or metabolic disorders such as rickets and scurvy. In well-preserved human skeletal or mummified tissue, whole genome sequencing has detected individuals with multiple infections of different M. tuberculosis strains. Such studies put modern findings into context and emphasize the importance of human population density in such circumstances."

Introduction
The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Nigeria began when an infected diplomat from Liberia arrived in Lagos, the most populous city in Africa, with subsequent transmission to another large city.
Methods
First-, second-, and third-generation contacts were traced, monitored, and classified. Symptomatic contacts were managed at Ebola treatment centers as suspected, probable, and confirmed EVD cases using standard operating procedures adapted from the World Health Organization EVD guidelines. Reverse transcription PCR tests confirmed EVD. Socio-demographic, clinical, hospitalization, and outcome data of the July–September 2014 Nigeria EVD cohort were analyzed.
Results
The median age of the 20 EVD cases was 33 years (interquartile range 26–62 years). More females (55%), health workers (65%), and persons <40 years old (60%) were infected than males, non-health workers, and persons aged ≥40 years. No EVD case management worker contracted the disease. Presenting symptoms were fever (85%), fatigue (70%), and diarrhea (65%). Clinical syndromes were gastroenteritis (45%), hemorrhage (30%), and encephalopathy (15%). The case-fatality rate was 40% and there was one mental health complication. The average duration from symptom onset to presentation was 3±2 days among survivors and 5±2 days for non-survivors. The mean duration from symptom onset to discharge was 15±5 days for survivors and 11±2 days for non-survivors. Mortality was higher in the older age group, males, and those presenting late.
Conclusion
The EVD outbreak in Nigeria was characterized by the severe febrile gastroenteritis syndrome typical of the West African outbreak, better outcomes, rapid containment, and no infection among EVD care-providers. Early case detection, an effective incident management system, and prompt case management with on-site mobilization and training of local professionals were key to the outcome."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is an important cause of mortality and morbidity in children with hematological malignancies. The monitoring of serum galactomannan (GM) antigen is considered useful in the diagnosis of IA . The aim of this study was to determine the utility of serum GM monitoring in the early diagnosis of IA and the role of positive antigenemia in the management of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
Methods
The cases of 141 children who were being treated for ALL in the Division of Pediatric Hematology of the Medical School of Ege University between January 2006 and February 2015 were reviewed retrospectively. Cases of proven and probable IA were defined according to the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) criteria.
Results
The incidence of proven and probable IA was 3.5% (5/141). The incidence of positive GM antigenemia among 3264 serum samples was 5.5% (n=179). Of the cases detected, 21.7% were true-positive, 52.1% were false-positive, and the remaining 26.1% were classified as ‘undetermined.’ An increase in the incidence of true-positive tests and induction of antifungal therapy was determined through multiple consecutive positive tests.
Conclusions
GM may be detected in the serum before the clinical signs of IA appear, but its sensitivity and specificity are variable. False-positivity is a significant disadvantage, and consecutive positive GM must be taken into account in the case of clinical and imaging findings that are relevant to IA."

Objectives
To identify the age- and sex-specific antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) in outpatient febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs) in Korea.
Methods
A total 2262 consecutive samples collected from patients aged 1–101 years with febrile UTIs, during the period January 2012 to December 2014, were analyzed in this multicentre, retrospective cohort study.
Results
The sensitivities to cefotaxime and cefoxitin were over 85% for females but under 75% for males. Sex played an important role in the susceptibility of GNB to cefotaxime (p<0.001) and cefoxitin (p<0.001). The sensitivity to ciprofloxacin (age >20 years) was under 75% in both sexes, and was not influenced by sex (p=0.204). Age distributions of the incidences of resistance to cefotaxime, cefoxitin, and ciprofloxacin (age >20 years) were similar to the age distribution of the incidence of GNB, which indicates that the resistance patterns to these drugs were not affected by age (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, female/male: p=0.927/p=0.509, p=0.193/p=0.911, and p=0.077/p=0.999, respectively).
Conclusions
Age is not a considerable factor in determining the antibiotic resistance in febrile UTIs. Ciprofloxacin should be withheld from both sexes until culture results indicate its use. Second- or third-generation cephalosporins such as cefoxitin and cefotaxime can be used empirically only in females."

abstract = "Summary
Background
During the years 2014 and 2015, the Region of the Americas underwent a devastating epidemic of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) of the Asian genotype, resulting in millions of affected individuals. However, epidemiological and clinical information on this experience is scarce. Prior knowledge of congenital and neonatal illness caused by CHIKV is limited and almost exclusively based on data obtained from a single outbreak of the East/Central/South African (ECSA) genotype. The effect of chikungunya fever (CHIKF) on pregnancy outcomes and its consequences for infants born to infected mothers at the peak of the epidemic wave in Latin America are reviewed herein. Epidemiological and clinical data on maternal and neonatal infections were collected prospectively and analyzed.
Methods
One hundred sixty-nine symptomatic newborns with CHIKF seen at four large regional maternity hospitals in three different Central and South American countries were evaluated prospectively. The outcomes of pregnancies in symptomatic infected mothers at two of these clinical centers were also analyzed.
Results
The observed vertical transmission rate ranged between 27.7% and 48.29%. The incidence of congenital disease was unrelated to the use of cesarean section or natural delivery. The case fatality rate (CFR) at the only center that reported deaths was 5.3%. The most common clinical manifestations included fever, irritability, rash, hyperalgesia syndrome, diffuse limb edema, meningoencephalitis, and bullous dermatitis. Severe complications included meningoencephalitis, myocarditis, seizures, and acute respiratory failure. Leukocytosis with neutrophilia and normal or increased platelets was a common finding, and in those with signs of meningeal involvement, moderate lymphocytic pleocytosis with normal glucose and protein levels was typical.
Conclusions
This study presents the largest number of symptomatic neonates with CHIKF analyzed so far in any region and is the first involving infection with the Asian genotype of CHIKV. Although the clinical manifestations found were similar to those reported previously, the percentage of neurological complications was lower. The CFR was comparatively high. Chikungunya represented a substantial risk for neonates born to symptomatic parturients during the chikungunya outbreak in the Americas Region, with important clinical and public health implications."

Searching for the presence of the mcr-1 gene in colistin resistant Enterobacteriaceae in countries of the Arabian Peninsula.
Methods
Seventy-five independent, colistin resistant Enterobacteriaceae strains isolated from clinical cases in Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were tested by PCR for the mcr-1 gene. mcr-1 positive strains were genotyped, and their antibiotic susceptibility was established. The mcr-1 containing plasmids were mobilized into Escherichia coli K-12 and their sequence was determined.
Results
Four E. coli isolates (two from Bahrain, one from Saudi Arabia and one from the United Arab Emirates) were identified carrying the mcr-1 gene on conjugative plasmids. They belonged to global multidrug resistant E. coli clones, i.e. ST648, ST224, ST68 and ST131, respectively. One strain carried the blaNDM-1 carbapenemase gene. Three strains carried mcr-1 on IncI2 type plasmids, one of them also harboring a blaCTX-M-64 gene. In the fourth strain mcr-1 was located on a 240kb IncHI2 plasmid co-harboring 13 other resistance genes.
Conclusions
This is the first report on the presence of the plasmid-coded mcr-1 gene in a variety of multi-resistant clinical isolates from the Arabian Peninsula indicating that several commonly used antibiotics can potentially facilitate the spread of mcr-1 carrying strains, or directly, mcr-1 containing plasmids."

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the interactions between linezolid (LZD) and second-line anti-tuberculosis (TB) agents in susceptible and multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB in vitro, and to validate the in vitro results in a murine TB model.
Methods
The minimum inhibitory concentrations of LZD and seven second-line anti-TB drugs against H37Rv and three multidrug-resistant clinical isolates were determined by Alamar Blue assay, and the interaction patterns of LZD and the seven second-line anti-TB agents against the four isolates were studied using a dynamic checkerboard method. The activities of these combinations against Mycobacterium tuberculosis were evaluated in a murine model of TB.
Results
The combination of LZD + capreomycin exhibited partial synergism for three of four isolates, LZD + para-aminosalicylic acid exhibited partial synergism for two of four isolates, and LZD + levofloxacin and LZD + amikacin exhibited partial synergism for one of four isolates; all other combinations showed indifference or an additive effect in vitro. The activities of six combinations and the standard regimen rifampicin + isoniazid + pyrazinamide were investigated in a murine model of TB (infection with H37Rv). Significant reductions in colony-forming units (CFU) were found in LZD + capreomycin and LZD + clofazimine groups when the CFU in the lungs on day 0 (the day of beginning treatment) was compared with the CFU in the lungs after 2 months of treatment.
Conclusions
These combinations of LZD and second-line anti-TB drugs were all active against MDR-TB with indifference or an additive effect, except LZD + capreomycin, which showed partial synergy."

To analyze 48 cases the risk factors of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) infections, the antibiotic costs after infection, and the survival conditions.
Design
1:3 matched case-control study a medical center in the eastern Taiwan area. The case group, patients with VRE bacterial strains detected at the sterile sites, and the control group were randomly selected from invasive vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus (VSE) infected patients at the nearest time point by taking the occurrence time of each VRE infection case as the reference time. Fisher exact tests were conducted in order to verify the existence of differences between the case and control groups; survival analysis was applied to explore the prognoses of the VRE infection cases.
Results
The mortality rate of the invasive VRE infection cases was 64.6%, which is obviously higher than that of the invasive VSE infection cases (39.4%); the fact of taking chemotherapy during a hospital stay as well as the use of third-generation cephalosporin, glycopeptides, and medicines of the metronidazole category before the infections, are the risk factors of future invasive VRE infections. Moreover, the antibiotic costs after the infections of invasive VRE infection cases are much higher than those of the VSE infection cases (the average daily cost is 3,433 new Taiwan dollars (NTD) vs. 1,742 NTD).
Conclusions
The history of receiving chemotherapy, the use of third-generation cephalosporin, glycopeptides, and medicines of the metronidazole category before the infections are the risk factors of VRE infections. The antibiotic costs after the infections of invasive VRE infection cases are much higher than those of the VSE infection cases."

Methods
A total of 6976 participants who completed a medical questionnaire and provided a stool sample for examination were included in the final analysis.
Results
The overall prevalence rates of Schistosoma japonicum, Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and hookworm were found to be moderate to high at 28.9%, 36.5%, 61.8%, and 28.4%, respectively. However, the prevalence of harbouring any of the helminths was found to be higher at 75.6%. Significant variation was evident among the predicted barangay-specific random effects for infection with S. japonicum (barangay variance of 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.31–1.40) and for any helminth infection (barangay variance of 0.63, 95% confidence interval 0.30–1.29). The predictive models showed, with greater than 80% sensitivity and specificity, that low socio-economic status, low levels of education, poor sanitation, proximity to water sources, occupation (i.e., farming and fishing), and male sex were all reliable indicators of infection status.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Helicobacter pylori infection has been associated with early childhood growth impairment in high- and middle-income countries; however, few studies have examined this relationship within low-income countries or have used a longitudinal design. The possible effects of H. pylori infection on growth trajectories were examined in a cohort of young Ethiopian children.
Methods
In 2011/12, 856 children (85.1% of the 1006 original singletons in a population-based birth cohort) were followed up at age 6.5 years. An interviewer-led questionnaire administered to mothers provided information on demographic and lifestyle variables. Height and weight were measured twice, and the average of the two measurements was used. Exposure to H. pylori infection was assessed using a rapid H. pylori stool antigen test. The independent associations of positive H. pylori infection status (measured at ages 3 and 6.5 years) with baseline height and weight (age 3 years) and height and weight growth trajectory (from age 3 to 6.5 years) were modelled using hierarchical linear models.
Results
At baseline (age 3 years), the children's mean height was 85.7cm and their mean weight was 11.9kg. They gained height at a mean rate of 8.7cm/year, and weight at a mean rate of 1.76kg/year. H. pylori infection was associated with lower baseline measurements and linear height trajectory (β=−0.74cm and −0.79cm/year, respectively), after controlling for demographics and markers of socio-economic status. However, the positive coefficient was associated with quadratic growth in height among H. pylori-infected children (β=0.28, 95% confidence interval 0.07 to 0.49, p<0.01), and indicated an increase in height trajectory as the child increased in age. A non-significant difference in baseline and trajectory of weight was observed between H. pylori-infected and non-infected children.
Conclusions
These findings add to the growing body of evidence supporting that H. pylori infection is inversely associated with childhood growth trajectory, after controlling for a range of factors associated with reduced growth and H. pylori status. Further follow-up will be important to confirm possible catch-up in height trajectory among H. pylori-infected children as they grow older."

The commonly used literature databases were searched. Meta-analyses were performed with fixed/random-effects models using Stata 12.0. The sustained virological response (SVR) rate was summarized using R software. Publication bias was examined through Egger's test.
Results
A total of seven studies were finally included in this meta-analysis. IFNL4 ss469415590 was demonstrated to be associated with SVR (odds ratio (OR) 3.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.22–4.56, p<0.001). Asians had a higher likelihood of achieving SVR than Caucasians (OR=7.36 vs. 3.54). When stratifying all the patients according to HCV genotype, a significant association was observed in HCV genotype 1 patients (OR 4.5, 95% CI 2.91–6.95, p<0.001). In HCV genotype 2/3 patients, the favorable TT/TT genotype patients tended to have a statistically higher SVR rate than the non-TT/TT genotype patients (84.4% vs. 78.3%, p=0.058). Compared with IL28B rs12979860 (OR 3.45) and rs8099917 (OR 3.50), ss469415590 TT/TT genotype patients showed a slightly higher probability of achieving a SVR (OR 3.61 calculated from studies investigating both IFNL4 and rs12979860; OR 4.86 for studies investigating both IFNL4 and rs8099917). Furthermore, ss469415590 showed a slightly higher predictive value than rs12979860 using the diagnostic test tool (area under the curve=0.71 vs. 0.70). IFNL4 was also correlated with rapid virological response (RVR) (OR 4.35, 95% CI 1.43–13.20, p=0.01), viral clearance (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.24–0.39, p<0.001), and HCV susceptibility (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.65–0.89, p=0.001).
Conclusions
IFNL4 ss469415590 is significantly associated with SVR in HCV genotype 1 patients, irrespective of race; there is a tendency towards an association in HCV genotype 2/3 patients. Comparable to IL28B, IFNL4 is correlated with natural viral clearance and HCV susceptibility, additionally IFNL4 ss469415590 has a slightly higher predictive performance over IL28B polymorphisms in regard to SVR."

On June 17, 2016, RESIST-TB, IMPAACT, Vital Strategies, and New Ventures jointly hosted the Pediatric Multidrug Resistant Tuberculosis Clinical Trials Landscape Meeting in Arlington, Virginia, USA. The meeting provided updates on current multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) trials targeting pediatric populations and adult trials that have included pediatric patients. A series of presentations were given that discussed site capacity needs, community engagement, and additional interventions necessary for clinical trials to improve the treatment of pediatric MDR-TB. This article presents a summary of topics discussed, including the following: current trials ongoing and planned; the global burden of MDR-TB in children; current regimens for MDR-TB treatment in children; pharmacokinetics of second-line anti-tuberculosis medications in children; design, sample size, and statistical considerations for MDR-TB trials in children; selection of study population, design, and treatment arms for a trial of novel pediatric MDR-TB regimens; practical aspects of pediatric MDR-TB treatment trials; and strategies for integrating children into adult tuberculosis trials. These discussions elucidated barriers to pediatric MDR-TB clinical trials and provided insight into necessary next steps for progress in this field. Investigators and funding agencies need to respond to these recommendations so that important studies can be implemented, leading to improved treatment for children with MDR-TB."

Around one third of the world's population may harbour latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), an asymptomatic immunological state that confers a heightened risk of subsequently developing tuberculosis (TB). Effectively treating LTBI will be essential if the End TB Strategy is to be realized. This review evaluates the evidence in relation to the effectiveness of preventive antibiotic therapy to treat LTBI due to both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant bacteria. Current national and international preventive therapy guidelines are summarized, as well as ongoing randomized trials evaluating regimens to prevent drug-resistant TB. Populations that may benefit most from screening and treatment for LTBI include close contacts of patients with TB (particularly children under 5 years of age) and individuals with substantial immunological impairment. The risks and benefits of treatment must be carefully balanced for each individual. Electronic decision support tools offer one way in which clinicians can help patients to make informed decisions. Modelling studies indicate that the expanded use of preventive therapy will be essential to achieving substantial reductions in the global TB burden. However, the widespread scale-up of screening and treatment will require careful consideration of cost-effectiveness, while ensuring the drivers of ongoing disease transmission are also addressed."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is a controversial marker for disease monitoring in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. The aim of this study was to determine the fibrosis stage and histological activity index (HAI) in HBeAg-negative CHB patients with persistently normal ALT (PNALT) and high serum HBV DNA (≥2000 IU/ml) and to investigate clinical risk factors for the requirement of treatment through the examination of liver biopsy specimens.
Methods
HBeAg-negative CHB patients with PNALT (≤40 IU/l) and high serum HBV DNA (≥2000 IU/ml) were included. HBV fibrosis stage and HAI were scored according to the Ishak system. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the independent risk factors for fibrosis stage ≥2 and/or HAI ≥6. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine an optimal age cut-off for liver biopsy.
Results
A total 120 patients were enrolled. These patients had a mean HBV DNA level of 123680±494500 IU/ml; the HBV DNA load was 2000–20000 IU/ml in 68 patients (56.6%) and ≥20000 IU/ml in 52 (43.4%). Eighteen patients (15%) had moderate-to-severe histological activity (HAI ≥6). Forty-three patients (35.9%) had a fibrosis stage ≥2. Forty-eight patients (40%) had a fibrosis stage ≥2 and/or HAI ≥6. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, independent variables associated with fibrosis stage ≥2 and/or HAI ≥6 included age and HBV DNA viral load. Patients with HBV DNA 2000–20000 IU/ml were more likely to require treatment compared to those with a viral load ≥20000 IU/ml. The optimal age cut-off to predict fibrosis stage ≥2 and/or HAI ≥6 was 46 years.
Conclusions
Significant liver damage was detected in 40% of CHB patients with PNALT and high HBV DNA upon biopsy. Age and HBV DNA viral load were independent predictors of significant liver damage. A biopsy to determine the degree of liver damage is advisable for CHB patients older than 46 years."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The bacterial genus Salmonella encompasses a large number of serotypes that are genetically very similar but biologically quite different, especially in pathogenic properties and host specificity. Serotyping has been used for the classification, identification, and epidemiological investigation due to its excellent discriminating power, but it cannot distinguish the different pathogenic lineages within a polyphyletic serotype. Additionally, very few institutions have the comprehensive set of antisera for typing. Therefore various studies have been performed to explore alternative assays to differentiate Salmonella isolates, such as the search for genes that can be used as potential molecular substitutes for serotyping. However, the genes tested so far have often given inconsistent results.
Methods
In this study, the discriminating power of seven genes to differentiate 309 Salmonella strains representing 26 serotypes was evaluated and the results were compared with those of other methods.
Results
The seven newly selected genes have a good power to differentiate different serovars. The tree based on the concatenated sequences of these genes revealed phylogenetic relationships of the bacteria consistent with that of the whole genome tree.
Conclusion
Individual Salmonella lineages each have specific genes that can be used to differentiate Salmonella isolates on a phylogenetic basis."

abstract = "Summary
Introduction
Boceprevir (BOC) was one of the first oral inhibitors of hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 protease to be developed. This study assessed the safety and efficacy of BOC+pegylated interferon-α2a/ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) in the retreatment of HIV–HCV co-infected patients with HCV genotype 1.
Methods
This was a phase III prospective trial. HIV–HCV (genotype 1) co-infected patients from 16 hospitals in Spain were included. These patients received 4 weeks of PEG-IFN/RBV (lead-in), followed by response-guided therapy with PEG-IFN/RBV plus BOC (a fixed 44 weeks was indicated in the case of cirrhosis). The primary endpoint was the sustained virological response (SVR) rate at 24 weeks post-treatment. Efficacy and safety were evaluated in all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug.
Results
From June 2013 to April 2014, 102 patients were enrolled, 98 of whom received at least one treatment dose. Seventy-three percent were male, 34% were cirrhotic, 23% had IL28b CC, 65% had genotype 1a, and 41% were previous null responders. The overall SVR rate was 67%. Previous null-responders and cirrhotic patients had lower SVR rates (57% and 51%, respectively). Seventy-six patients (78%) completed the therapy scheme; the most common reasons for discontinuation were lack of response at week 12 (12 patients) and adverse events (six patients).
Conclusions
Response-guided therapy with BOC in combination with PEG-IFN/RBV led to an overall SVR rate of 67%, but an SVR rate of only 51% in patients with cirrhosis. The therapy was generally well tolerated. Although the current standards of care do not include BOC+PEG-IFN/RBV, the authors believe that this combination can be beneficial in situations where new HCV direct antiviral agent interferon-free therapies are not available yet."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
CC22-MRSA-IV, UK-EMRSA-15/Barnim EMRSA, is a common and pandemic strain of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) that has been found mainly in Western Europe, but also in other parts of the world including some Gulf countries. One suspected case of an infection with this strain in a patient who was admitted to the surgical unit in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) was investigated in order to check whether this strain has reached KSA.
Methods
Besides the index isolate, 46 additional isolates of CC22-MRSA-IV from patients from KSA, Abu Dhabi, Kuwait, and Germany (patients with a history of travel in the Middle East), were characterized by microarray hybridization.
Results
The study revealed a regional presence of as many as six distinct ‘strains’ of CC22-MRSA-IV that could be distinguished based on carriage of SCCmec IV subtypes and virulence factors. No true UK-EMRSA-15/Barnim EMRSA was identified in Riyadh; all suspected isolates from Riyadh were assigned to other, albeit related strains. However, this strain was identified in Abu Dhabi and Kuwait.
Conclusions
CC22-MRSA-IV from KSA could be linked to other epidemic strains from the Middle East and possibly India, rather than to the Western European UK-EMRSA-15/Barnim EMRSA. High-resolution typing methods, including SCCmec subtyping, might help to differentiate related epidemic strains and to monitor routes of transmission."

abstract = "Summary
Objective
To examine the association between hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and liver fibrosis in HIV-infected patients in Zambia and Switzerland.
Methods
HIV-infected adults starting antiretroviral therapy in two clinics in Zambia and Switzerland were included. Liver fibrosis was evaluated using the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet-ratio index (APRI), with a ratio >1.5 defining significant fibrosis and a ratio >2.0 indicating cirrhosis. The association between hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity, HBV replication, and liver fibrosis was examined using logistic regression.
Results
In Zambia, 96 (13.0%) of 739 patients were HBsAg-positive compared to 93 (4.5%) of 2058 in Switzerland. HBsAg-positive patients were more likely to have significant liver fibrosis than HBsAg-negative ones: the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) was 3.25 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.44–7.33) in Zambia and 2.50 (95% CI 1.19–5.25) in Switzerland. Patients with a high HBV viral load (≥20000 IU/ml) were more likely to have significant liver fibrosis compared to HBsAg-negative patients or patients with an undetectable viral load: aOR 3.85 (95% CI 1.29–11.44) in Zambia and 4.20 (95% CI 1.64–10.76) in Switzerland. In both settings, male sex was a strong risk factor for significant liver fibrosis.
Conclusions
Despite the differences in HBV natural history between Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe, the degree of liver fibrosis and the association with important risk factors were similar."

A total of 120 PA isolates were recovered from various clinical specimens at university hospital in Thailand. Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) of all the isolates were determined by the E-test method. PK parameters were obtained from a published study. Monte Carlo simulation was performed to calculate the percentage of target attainment (PTA) and cumulative fraction of response (CFR).
Results
MIC90 of fosfomycin alone, fosfomycin in combination with carbapenem, carbapenems alone and carbapenems in combination with fosfomycin were >1,024, 1,024, >32 and 32μg/ml, for multidrug resistant (MDR)-PA and 512, 128, 8 and 3μg/ml respectively, for non-MDR PA. Approximately 40% of the non-MDR PA were carbapenem-resistant strains. For non-MDR PA with CRPA, fosfomycin 16g continuous infusion in combination with carbapenems provided %PTA of approximately 80 and %CFR of > 88. While, %PTA and %CFR > 90 were achieved with fosfomycin 24g/day prolonged infusion in combination with carbapenem.

Objective
To reduce ventilator-associated infections (VARI) and improve outcomes for children.
Methods
This prospective interventional cohort study was conducted in a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) over three periods: pre-intervention, early post-intervention, and late post-intervention. These children were on mechanical ventilation (MV) for ≥48h.
Results
Overall, 312 children (11.9% of whom underwent tracheostomy) and 6187 ventilator-days were assessed. There was a significant reduction in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) among tracheostomized patients (8.16, 3.27, and 0.65 per 1000 tracheostomy ventilation-days before the intervention, after the general bundle implementation, and after the tracheostomy intervention, respectively). The median time from onset of MV to diagnosis of ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) increased from 5.5 to 48 days in the late post-intervention period (p=0.004), and was associated with a significant increase in median 28-day ventilator-free days and PICU-free days. Tracheostomy (odds ratio 7.44) and prolonged MV (odds ratio 2.75) were independent variables significantly associated with VARI. A trend towards a reduction in PICU mortality was observed, from 28.4% to 16.6% (relative risk 0.58).
Conclusions
The implementation of a care bundle to prevent VARI in children had a different impact on VAP and VAT, diminishing VAP rates and delaying VAT onset, resulting in reduced healthcare resource use. Tracheostomized children were at increased risk of VARI, but preventive measures had a greater impact on them."

Methods
Pap smear materials were obtained from 140 patients aged 18-59, who visited the outpatient gynecological clinic. Microscopic examination was done to detect dysplasia, and HPV genotyping was done using real-time multiplex PCR.
Results
HPV testing showed that among 61 HPV positive patients, the most prevalent types were 16 and 18. Microscopic examination showed that 79% of the samples had normal cytology, while 13% had CIN grade I, 5% had CIN grade II, and 3% had CIN grade III. The analysis revealed that 12% of the samples had CIN cytology and presence of HPV. Approximately 31% had HPV without cervical dysplasia, while 8% of samples were CIN positive without HPV infection. A statistically significant relationship between HPV 16 and HPV 33 positive samples and CIN grade II and III was found.

The prevalence and intensity of infection were determined by Kato–Katz thick smear stool examination at baseline and 2 years after curative treatment. The degree of hepatic fibrosis was assessed by ultrasound. Non-invasive serum biomarkers of hepatic fibrosis were also evaluated.
Results
The baseline human prevalence and infection intensity were found to be moderately high at 34% and 123 eggs per gram, respectively. However, hepatic parenchymal fibrosis occurred in 50% of subjects, with grade II fibrosis in 19% and grade III in 6%. The ELF score and higher serum levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) and hyaluronic acid (HA) correlated with the grade of liver fibrosis.
Conclusions
The findings of this study demonstrated that praziquantel treatment had a short-term impact on both the prevalence and intensity of infection, but less of an impact on established morbidity. Higher TIMP-1 and HA serum levels, and an ELF cut-off score of 8 were found to be correlated with the grade of liver fibrosis; these values may, therefore, assist physicians in identifying individuals at greater risk of disease."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Seasonal influenza causes annual epidemics by the accumulation of antigenic changes. Pandemic influenza occurs through a major antigenic change of the influenza A virus, which can originate from other hosts. Although new antigenic variants of the influenza A virus replace formerly circulating seasonal and pandemic viruses, replacement mechanisms remain poorly understood.
Methods
A stochastic individual-based SEIR (susceptible–exposed–infectious–recovered) model with two viral strains (formerly circulating old strain and newly emerged strain) was developed for simulations to elucidate the replacement mechanisms.
Results
Factors and conditions of virus and host populations affecting the replacement were identified. Replacement is more likely to occur in tropical regions than temperate regions. The magnitude of the ongoing epidemic by the old strain, herd immunity against the old strain, and timing of appearance of the new strain are not that important for replacement. It is probable that the frequency of replacement by a pandemic virus is higher than a seasonal virus because of the high initial susceptibility and high basic reproductive number of the pandemic virus.
Conclusions
The findings of this study on replacement mechanisms could lead to a better understanding of virus transmission dynamics and may possibly be helpful in establishing an effective strategy to mitigate the impact of seasonal and pandemic influenza."

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 10.4 million people died of tuberculosis (TB) in 2015, and the disease is now the number one cause of death from a preventable infectious disease worldwide. A bold vision is needed from global leaders to end the TB epidemic and plans to this end have been proposed. However enthusiasm must be matched by tangible and achievable goals based on the science and available funding. In order to reach the target and goals set by the WHO End TB Strategy, the challenges for TB eradication need to be addressed. In order to achieve the targets, several areas need to be bolstered, including the requirement to better identify and treat existing drug-susceptible cases and diagnose all the drug-resistant forms of the disease. Although treatment is available for most TB patients, stock-outs and other delays are problematic in some settings, resulting in ongoing transmission, especially for the drug-resistant forms of the disease. Despite the fact that a majority of multidrug-resistant cases are linked to treatment, the cure rate is only 50%, which highlights the need for safer, shorter, and more efficacious drug regimens that are more tolerable to patients. Prospects for a more efficacious vaccine are limited, with no correlates of protection identified; thus the availability of a vaccine by 2025 is highly improbable. Support for instituting infection control methods should be prioritized to subvert transmission while patients seek treatment and care. Finally, more adequate financial mechanisms should be instituted to reduce patient expenditures and support national TB programs. Moreover, funding to support basic science, drug development, clinical trials, vaccine development, diagnostics, and implementation research needs to be secured in order to reduce global TB incidence in the future."

Globally 10.4 million new tuberculosis (TB) incident cases were estimated to have occurred in 2015, of which 3% were reported in the World Health Organization European Region. Importantly, about 25% of the global multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) cases are reported in the European Region, representing one of the greatest challenges to TB control; these are reported particularly in the countries of the Former Soviet Union. Over a quarter of TB cases in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) are reported among foreign-born individuals. In line with the recent increase of migration flows towards Europe, TB among migrant populations is also on the rise, emphasizing the need for a better understanding of the TB trends at the regional and sub-regional levels, and of the existing policies on migrants and refugees. The present article is aimed at describing the policies and practices of European countries with a low and intermediate TB incidence with regard to the detection and management of TB and latent TB infection (LTBI) among refugees in Europe."

abstract = "Summary
Despite the high coverage of directly observed treatment short-course (DOTS), tuberculosis (TB) continues to affect 10.4 million people each year, and kills 1.8 million. High TB mortality, the large number of missing TB cases, the emergence of severe forms of drug resistance, and the slow decline in TB incidence indicate that merely expanding the coverage of TB services is insufficient to end the epidemic. In the era of the End TB Strategy, we need to think beyond coverage and start focusing on the quality of TB care that is routinely offered to patients in high burden countries, in both public and private sectors. In this review, current evidence on the quality of TB care in high burden countries, major gaps in the quality of care, and some novel efforts to measure and improve the quality of care are described. Based on systematic reviews on the quality of TB care or surrogates of quality (e.g., TB diagnostic delays), analyses of TB care cascades, and newer studies that directly measure quality of care, it is shown that the quality of care in both the public and private sector falls short of international standards and urgently needs improvement. National TB programs will therefore need to systematically measure and improve quality of TB care and invest in quality improvement programs."

Background
This descriptive, non-comparative, phase III study evaluated the safety and tolerability of cell culture-derived (TIVc) and egg-derived (TIV) seasonal influenza vaccines in children at risk of influenza-related complications.
Methods
Four hundred and thirty subjects were randomized 2:1 to TIVc or TIV. Subjects aged 3 to <9 years received one dose (if previously vaccinated, n=89) or two doses (if not previously vaccinated, n=124) of the study vaccines; the 9 to <18-year-olds (n=213) received one dose. Reactogenicity was assessed for 7 days after vaccination; safety was monitored for 6 months.
Results
After any vaccination, the most frequently reported solicited local adverse event (AE) was tenderness/pain (TIVc 44%, 66%, 53% and TIV 56%, 51%, 65% in the age groups 3 to <6 years, 6 to <9 years, and 9 to <18 years, respectively) and the systemic AE was irritability (22% TIVc, 24% TIV) in 3 to <6-year-olds and headache in 6 to <9-year-olds (20% TIVc, 13% TIV) and 9 to <18-year-olds (21% TIVc, 26% TIV). There were no cases of severe fever (≥40°C). No vaccine-related serious AEs were noted. New onset of chronic disease was reported in ≤1% of subjects.
Conclusion
TIVc and TIV had acceptable tolerability and similar safety profiles in at-risk children (NCT01998477)."

Background
The aim of this study was to determine the role of baseline hepatitis B virus (HBV) forming covalently closed circular DNA (HBV cccDNA) in liver inflammation in patients infected with HBV with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels under two times the upper limit of normal (2×ULN).
Methods
After liver biopsy and serum virological and biochemical marker screening, patients diagnosed with chronic HBV infection with serum ALT levels under 2×ULN and histological liver inflammation of less than grade G2 were prospectively recruited into this study. Recruitment took place between March 2009 and November 2010 at the Center of Infectious Disease, Sichuan University. Patient virological and biochemical markers, as well as markers of liver inflammation, were monitored.
Results
A total of 102 patients were recruited and 68 met the inclusion criteria; the median follow-up was 4.1 years (range 3.9–5.2 years). During follow-up, 41 patients (60.3%) exhibited signs of inflammation. Baseline HBV cccDNA >1 copy/cell (odds ratio 9.43, p=0.049) and liver inflammation grade ≥G1 (odds ratio 5.77, p=0.046) were both independent predictors of liver inflammation.
Conclusions
A higher baseline intrahepatic HBV cccDNA level may increase the risk of liver inflammation. Further investigations will be required to validate HBV cccDNA as an intrahepatic virological marker of patients who require extended outpatient management."

Objective
There have been no long-term studies on trends in antibiotic resistance (ABR) on a national scale in India. Using a private laboratory network, the ABR patterns of organisms most commonly associated with bacteremia, obtained from patients across India between 2008 and 2014, were examined.
Methods
A retrospective study of patient blood cultures collected over a 7-year period (January 1, 2008–December 31, 2014) was conducted. Data on the microorganism(s) identified and their antimicrobial susceptibility were obtained from SRL Diagnostics (Mumbai, India).
Results
Of 135268 blood cultures, 18695 (14%) had at least one identified pathogen. In addition to continual high rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; approximately 44.2%), high resistance to nalidixic acid among Salmonella Typhi (98%) was observed, and carbapenem resistance increased in both Escherichia coli (7.8% to 11.5%; p=0.332) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (41.5% to 56.6%; p<0.001). Carbapenem resistance was also stable and high for both Acinetobacter species (approximately 69.6%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (approximately 49%). Resistance was also detected to colistin in the Gram-negatives and to vancomycin and linezolid in S. aureus.
Conclusion
Increasing resistance to antibiotics of last-resort, particularly among Gram-negatives, suggests an urgent need for new antibiotics and improved antimicrobial stewardship programs in India."

Objectives
To examine the appropriateness of antibiotics prescribed for acute infection based on the Malaysian national antibiotic guidelines and the defined daily dose (DDD) system of the World Health Organization (WHO). This study also aimed to describe the factors influencing the drug use pattern and to investigate the procurement patterns of antibiotics in the primary healthcare setting.
Methods
A retrospective cohort follow-up study of randomly selected patients from all patients who received any antibiotic between January and December 2013 was conducted at three primary healthcare clinics in Selangor State of Malaysia. For each patient, the following information was recorded: name of the antibiotic, frequency and dose, and Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) group. The defined daily dose per 1000 inhabitants per day was calculated for each antibiotic. The national antibiotic guidelines were used to assess the appropriateness of each antibiotic prescription.
Results
A total of 735 patients were included in the study. The five most used antibiotics were amoxicillin (1.36g, 35.2%), cloxacillin (0.68g, 26.3%), erythromycin (0.32g, 22.3%), bacampicillin (0.13g, 7.2%), and cephalexin (0.11g, 6.9%). Respiratory tract infections were the most commonly treated infections, and the doctors’ preferred antibiotic for the treatment of these infections was amoxicillin. More than 18% of all amoxicillin prescriptions were deemed inappropriate according to the national antibiotic guidelines. In terms of procurement costs, USD 88885 was spent in 2011, USD 219402 in 2012, and USD 233034 in 2013 at the three primary healthcare clinics, an average of USD 180440 per year for the three clinics.
Conclusions
This study reports the antibiotic usage at three primary healthcare clinics in Klang Province. The most prescribed antibiotic was amoxicillin in capsules (250mg), which was mainly prescribed for respiratory infections. Although the national antibiotic guidelines state that amoxicillin is a preferred drug for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, this drug is also being prescribed for other disease conditions, such as acute pharyngitis and acute tonsillitis. This result shows that current practice is not following the current antibiotic guidelines, which state that phenoxypenicillin should be the preferred drug."

The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Tuberculosis Report 2015 states that 28% of the world's 9.6 million new tuberculosis (TB) cases are in the WHO Africa Region. The Mano River Union (MRU) countries of West Africa–Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia–have made incremental sustained investments into TB control programmes over the past two decades. The devastating Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak of 2014–2015 in West Africa impacted significantly on all sectors of the healthcare systems in the MRU countries, including the TB prevention and control programmes. The EVD outbreak also had an adverse impact on the healthcare workforce and healthcare service delivery. At the height of the EVD outbreak, numerous staff members in all MRU countries contracted EBV at the Ebola treatment units and died. Many healthcare workers were also infected in healthcare facilities that were not Ebola treatment units but were national hospitals and peripheral health units that were unprepared for receiving patients with EVD. In all three MRU countries, the disruption to TB services due to the EVD epidemic will no doubt have increased Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission, TB morbidity and mortality, and decreased patient adherence to TB treatment, and the likely impact will not be known for several years to come. In this viewpoint, the impact that the EVD outbreak had on TB diagnostic, management, and prevention services is described. Vaccination against TB with BCG in children under 5 years of age was affected adversely by the EVD epidemic. The EVD outbreak was a result of global failure and represents yet another ‘wake-up call’ to the international community, and particularly to African governments, to reach a consensus on new ways of thinking at the national, regional, and global levels for building healthcare systems that can sustain their function during outbreaks. This is necessary so that other disease control programmes (like those for TB, malaria, and HIV) are not compromised during the emergency measures of a severe epidemic."

The Republic of Congo is on the World Health Organization (WHO) list of ‘high burden’ countries for tuberculosis (TB) and HIV. TB is the leading cause of death among HIV-infected patients in the Republic of Congo. In this viewpoint, the available data on TB and HIV in the Republic of Congo are reviewed, and the gaps and bottlenecks that the National TB Control Program (NTCP) faces are discussed. Furthermore, priority requirements for developing and implementing TB and HIV collaborative service activities are identified. HIV and TB control programs operate as distinct entities with separate case management plans. The implementation of collaborative TB/HIV activities to evaluate and monitor the management of TB/HIV co-infected individuals remains inefficient in most regions, and these activities are sometimes non-existent. This reveals major challenges that require definition in order to improve the delivery of healthcare. The NTCP lacks adequate resources for optimal implementation of control measures of TB and HIV compliance and outcomes. The importance of aligning and integrating TB and HIV treatment services (including follow-up) and adherence support services through coordinated and collaborative efforts between individual TB and HIV programs is discussed. Aligning and integrating TB and HIV treatment services through coordinated and collaborative efforts between individual TB and HIV programs is required. However, the WHO recommendations are generic, and health services in the Republic of Congo need to tailor their TB and HIV programs according to the availability of resources and operational feasibility. This will also open opportunities for synergizing collaborative TB/HIV research and training activities, which should be prioritized by the donors supporting the TB/HIV programs."

Objective
To estimate the number of people living in Thailand with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), a major cause of liver cirrhosis and cancer, in view of the implementation of programs to prevent CHB complications.
Methods
Using PubMed/Medline and ScienceDirect, all studies reporting hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroprevalence estimates conducted in Thailand and published between 1975 and 2015 were reviewed systematically. Pooled prevalence estimates and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated, and potential sources of heterogeneity investigated.
Results
A high heterogeneity was observed between prevalence estimates. There was a significant decrease in the 150 estimates of HBsAg prevalence with more recent decades of birth (p<0.001), even before the implementation of the national universal immunization program in 1992. When restricted to the general population, the pooled prevalence estimate was 5.1% (95% CI 4.3–6.0%), which would translate to an estimated number of individuals with CHB living in Thailand in 2015 as high as three million.
Conclusions
The high burden of CHB in Asian countries is a major challenge for the incorporation of national programs to prevent CHB complications within health care systems."

To estimate the prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and antimicrobial-resistant P. aeruginosa in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in mainland China.
Methods
Meta-analyses of 50 studies published from 2010 to 2014 were conducted, followed by pre-defined subgroup analyses and meta-regressions.
Results
P. aeruginosa accounted for 19.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 17.6–21.2%) of all isolates in VAP, which was similar to the proportion in HAP of 17.8% (95% CI 14.6–21.6%), but significantly greater than the proportion in CAP of 7.7% (15/195, p<0.001). Regarding VAP, the prevalence of P. aeruginosa has decreased since 2007. P. aeruginosa exhibited varying resistance to agents recommended for the initial management of VAP, with a high level of resistance to gentamicin (51.1%, 95% CI 37.7–64.4%) and a low level of resistance to amikacin (22.5%, 95% CI 14.3–33.6%). The prevalence of P. aeruginosa isolates resistant to agents recommended for the treatment of HAP ranged from 22.2% (95% CI 13.8–33.6%) for amikacin to 50.0% (95% CI 30.2–69.8%) for cefoperazone.

Objectives
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme polymorphisms seem to significantly influence the variability of the responses to certain antiretroviral drugs and their toxicity levels. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of the CYP2B6 G516T polymorphism on hepatic, renal, immunological, and viral marker changes in HIV-1-positive patients receiving treatment in an ethnically diverse region of the Amazon.
Methods
CYP2B6 G516T genotyping was performed by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) in samples from 185 patients. Urea, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), CD4+/CD8+ T-cell counts, and HIV-1 plasma viral load were measured.
Results
The polymorphic CYP2B6 G516T allele frequency was 0.36, which is different from the frequencies in other ethnic groups. The polymorphic genotype was associated with changes in the urea and ALT levels, although the median values were within the normal range. The TT genotype was also associated with significantly lower CD4+ T-cell counts in patients using efavirenz.
Conclusions
The CYP2B6 G516T polymorphism seems to affect the response to efavirenz treatment by reducing CD4+ T-cell counts in patients with a high degree of miscegenation who use this antiretroviral agent."

This study assessed the impact of annual versus biennial praziquantel treatment regimens on the prevalence, intensity of infection, and liver fibrosis dynamics of Asiatic schistosomiasis (caused by Schistosoma japonicum) among individuals residing in 18 endemic barangays in Northern Samar, Philippines.
Methods
Five hundred and sixty-five subjects who reported symptoms of gastrointestinal illness and/or were believed to have clinical morbidity based on physical examination were selected for cohort follow-up.
Results
The mean prevalence of schistosomiasis was 34% and the mean intensity of infection was 123.1 eggs per gram. Moderate to severe hepatic fibrosis (grade II/III) was demonstrated in approximately 25% of the study population. As expected, a greater reduction in both the prevalence and intensity of infection was documented with two treatment rounds versus one. Overall, hepatic fibrosis (grades I–III) regressed in only 24.3% of those who received a single treatment and in only 19.3% of those who received two doses. The prevalence of grade II–III fibrosis at baseline (25.2%) remained unchanged 2 years after treatment.
Conclusions
These findings suggest that in order to reverse moderate to severe liver fibrosis due to schistosomiasis and improve clinical outcomes, a higher clinical dosage of praziquantel (i.e., 60–80mg/kg) may be required over an extended duration."

Objectives
The aim of this study was to assess the characteristics of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) due to Staphylococcus lugdunensis and to compare these to the characteristics of PJI due to Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
Methods
A retrospective multicentre study including all consecutive cases of S. lugdunensis PJI (2000–2014) was performed. Eighty-eight cases of staphylococcal PJI were recorded: 28 due to S. lugdunensis, 30 to S. aureus, and 30 to S. epidermidis, as identified by Vitek 2 or API Staph (bioMérieux).
Results
Clinical symptoms were more often reported in the S. lugdunensis group, and the median delay between surgery and infection was shorter for the S. lugdunensis group than for the S. aureus and S. epidermidis groups. Regarding antibiotic susceptibility, the S. lugdunensis strains were susceptible to antibiotics and 61% of the patients could be treated with levofloxacin + rifampicin. The outcome of the PJI was favourable for 89% of patients with S. lugdunensis, 83% with S. aureus, and 97% with S. epidermidis.
Conclusion
S. lugdunensis is an emerging pathogen with a pathogenicity quite similar to that of S. aureus. This coagulase-negative Staphylococcus must be identified precisely in PJI, in order to select the appropriate surgical treatment and antibiotics ."

Objectives
The aims of this study were to determine predictive factors of paradoxical reaction in patients with cervical lymph node tuberculosis (TB) and to discuss the therapeutic management of this condition.
Materials and methods
A retrospective study was performed of 501 patients managed for cervical lymph node TB over a period of 12 years (from January 2000 to December 2011). Statistical data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 20.0.
Results
Paradoxical reaction occurred in 67 patients (13.4%), with a median delay to onset after starting TB treatment of 7 months. Lymph node size ≥3cm and associated extra-lymph node TB were independently associated with paradoxical reaction. Treatment consisted of surgical excision (71.6%), restarting quadruple therapy (10.4%), reintroduction of ethambutol (23.8%), and addition of ciprofloxacin (20.8%); steroids were given in two cases . All patients recovered after an average treatment duration of 14.91±7.03 months.
Conclusion
The occurrence of paradoxical reaction in cervical lymph node TB seems to be predicted by associated extra-lymph node TB and a swelling size ≥3cm. The treatment of paradoxical reaction remains unclear and more randomized trials are necessary to improve its management."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Dengue is the most rapidly spreading disease caused by a mosquito-borne virus in the world. The incidence of dengue globally has increased 30-fold in the last 50 years. Understanding the prevalence of dengue and its longitudinal trends can improve prevention and control strategies. This study assessed the trends in prevalence of dengue in Taiwan by population characteristics and geographical region.
Methods
Dengue and population data for the years 2010–2015 were obtained from the public statistics databases of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control and Department of Statistics, Taiwan Ministry of Interior. Yearly prevalence rates of dengue were calculated by age group, sex, and administrative area within five geographic regions (northern, mid-western, southern, and eastern regions, and outer islands).
Results
The national prevalence rate of dengue decreased gradually from 8 to 4 per 100000 population between 2010 and 2013, but it increased substantially in 2014 and 2015 to 67 and 187 per 100000 population, respectively. There was no significant difference in prevalence rate between males and females. People aged 60–69 years had a significantly higher prevalence rate than those in the other age groups during 2010–2014, and people aged over 70 years had the highest rate in 2015 (309 per 100000 population). The southern region had the highest yearly dengue prevalence rate (the rate decreased from 23 to 9 per 100000 population between 2010 and 2013, but increased to 220 and 616 per 100000 population in 2014 and 2015, respectively). Three unexpected outbreaks of dengue were observed during the study period: the first outbreak occurred in Penghu County in 2011 (prevalence rate 101 per 100000 population), the second in Kaohsiung City in 2014 (prevalence rate 540 per 100000 population), and the third in Tainan City in 2015 (prevalence rate 1208 per 100000 population).
Conclusions
More efforts are still needed to prevent and control dengue in Taiwan. The government should direct resources and interventions to southern Taiwan, which has a tropical climate and a high population density, and should target older people who are more likely to be infected. Strategies are also needed to respond quickly to unexpected incidents to prevent dengue outbreaks."

Objectives
An analysis of the risk factors and seasonal and spatial distribution of individuals with subclinical malaria in hypoendemic Bangladesh was performed.
Methods
From 2009 to 2012, active malaria surveillance without regard to symptoms was conducted on a random sample (n=3971) and pregnant women (n=589) during a cohort malaria study in a population of 24000.
Results
The overall subclinical Plasmodium falciparum malaria point prevalence was 1.0% (n=35), but was 3.2% (n=18) for pregnant women. The estimated incidence was 39.9 per 1000 person-years for the overall population. Unlike symptomatic malaria, with a marked seasonal pattern, subclinical infections did not show a seasonal increase during the rainy season. Sixty-nine percent of those with subclinical P. falciparum infections reported symptoms commonly associated with malaria compared to 18% without infection. Males, pregnant women, jhum cultivators, and those living closer to forests and at higher elevations had a higher prevalence of subclinical infection.
Conclusions
Hypoendemic subclinical malaria infections were associated with a number of household and demographic factors, similar to symptomatic cases. Unlike clinical symptomatic malaria, which is highly seasonal, these actively detected infections were present year-round, made up the vast majority of infections at any given time, and likely acted as reservoirs for continued transmission."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Staphylococcus aureus is a commensal pathogen with a virulon that is under agr control. agr dysfunction has been seen in clinical strains that do not respond positively to treatment. This study aimed to establish the association between the genes in the virulon and the presence of agr and to determine the relationship between the presence or absence of agr and pathogenicity.
Methods
PCR was used to identify the presence of the agr operon in 101 clinical S. aureus strains. δ-Haemolysin screening was conducted on all agr-positive strains using the blood agar assay. Singleplex and/or multiplex PCR was used to determine the presence of 31 virulence genes in the strains. Caenorhabditis elegans infectivity and lifespan assays were conducted using 30 CF512 nematodes per strain in triplicate. Significance associated with the carriage of virulence and agr genes was determined using the Chi-square test. Nematode survival was measured using Kaplan–Meier survival estimates and differences in survival were assessed using the log-rank test.
Results
The frequency of agr-negative strains was 20%. All groups of virulence genes were significantly associated with agr-positive strains: enterotoxin (p<0.001), toxins (p<0.001), capsule (p=0.036), and microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMMs) (p=0.0026). The median lifespan (q=0.5) of agr-negative strains was 15.5 days and of agr-positive strains was 6.5 days. The log-rank test showed a significant difference in the survival rate of nematodes exposed to the two groups (p=0.006).
Conclusions
There was a strong association between the carriage of virulence genes and the presence of the agr operon in clinical strains of S. aureus. Further, agr-positive strains were more pathogenic than agr-negative strains, suggesting a correlation between the presence of agr, carriage of virulence determinants, and pathogenicity."

Objectives
Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is a fast and reliable method for the identification of bacteria. A MALDI Sepsityper kit is generally used to prepare samples obtained directly from culture bottles. However, the relatively high cost of this kit is a major obstacle to introducing this method into routine clinical use. In this study, the accuracies of three different preparation methods for rapid direct identification of bacteria from positive blood culture bottles by MALDI-TOF MS analysis were compared.
Methods
In total, 195 positive bottles were included in this study.
Results
Overall, 78.5%, 68.7%, and 76.4% of bacteria were correctly identified to the genus level (score ≥1.7) directly from positive blood cultures using the Sepsityper, centrifugation, and saponin methods, respectively. The identification rates using the Sepsityper and saponin methods were significantly higher than that using the centrifugation method (Sepsityper vs. centrifugation, p<0.001; saponin vs. centrifugation, p=0.003).
Conclusions
These results suggest that the saponin method is superior to the centrifugation method and comparable to the Sepsityper method in the accuracy of rapid bacterial identification directly from blood culture bottles, and could be a less expensive alternative to the Sepsityper method."

Helicobacter pylori is a bacterium that infects over 50% of the human population worldwide. An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that H. pylori may cause liver diseases, and the underlying relationship between H. pylori infection and chronic hepatitis B has attracted much attention. This study aimed to examine the association between H. pylori infection and the progression of chronic hepatitis B in the Chinese population.
Methods
A search was performed of the PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases, as well as the Chinese databases, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang Data, for studies published between January 1, 1994 and November 1, 2015.
Results
In total, 2977 patients were included in the chronic hepatitis B group, while 1668 participants were included in the healthy control group. The prevalence of H. pylori among patients with chronic hepatitis B was significantly higher than that among those without chronic hepatitis B. The pooled odds ratio was 3.17. In the subgroup analysis, the odds ratio was 4.28 for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis and 6.02 for hepatocellular carcinoma.
Conclusion
These results indicate a strong relationship between H. pylori and chronic hepatitis B, particularly during HBV progression."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Sparganosis is an important parasitic disease in Guangzhou and is mainly acquired through the consumption of frog meat or contact with fresh frogs infected by larval stages (spargana) of the tapeworm species Spirometra mansoni.
Methods
In this study, the prevalence of intestinal S. mansoni infections (with adult parasites) in dogs and cats and of extraintestinal S. mansoni infections (with spargana) in frogs was assessed. In addition, a questionnaire survey was carried out among residents in Guangzhou City in order to evaluate their awareness about the medical and epidemiological relevance of Spirometra and sparganosis.
Results
In total, the feces of 229 dogs and 116 cats were examined for eggs, and 1949 frogs were examined for spargana. Sixty-three dogs (27.5%) and 47 cats (40.5%) had eggs in their feces. Two hundred and sixteen out of 416 wild Rana tigrina rugulosa Wiegmann frogs examined were sparganum-positive, with an infection rate of 51.9%, while the infection rate in Rana limnocharis Boie was 35.1% (13/37). None of the tested farmed frogs (including R. tigrina rugulosa and Rana catesbeiana) was positive (0/1382). Analysis of the questionnaire revealed the following results: (1) about 41.0% of residents in Guangzhou had some knowledge of sparganosis or sparganum infection, and information in TV programs was the most important way that residents learned about sparganosis. (2) About 59.9% of the residents ate frog meat. Eating the meat, viscera, or blood of animals, e.g., frogs, snakes, pigs, chicken, mice, and birds, in an improper way might be the main means by which residents acquire the infection. (3) The risk of sparganum infection was higher in males than in females.
Conclusions
A high sparganum infection rate was observed in the wild frogs sold in agricultural product markets in Guangzhou. The infection was also serious in cats and dogs in Guangdong Province. With lifestyles and eating habits resulting in sparganum infection, it is necessary to focus on market management and community education in order to prevent the transmission of this disease in Guangzhou."

Background
Little is known about the association between the initiation of hepatitis B vaccine (HB vaccine) at birth and completion of the HB vaccine and the national immunization program vaccine (NIPV) series in Fujian, China.
Methods
A provincial survey, including children in the community and newborns in hospital, was conducted to evaluate coverage with a timely first dose of HB vaccine and the completion of three doses of HB vaccine and the NIPV series in 2013. A proportion of the samples was rechecked to investigate the relationship between the administration of a timely first dose of HB vaccine and completion of the HB vaccine series and the NIPV series (three doses of HB vaccine, one dose of Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine, three doses of oral poliomyelitis vaccine, three doses of diphtheria–tetanus–pertussis vaccine, one dose of measles-containing vaccine, one dose of Japanese encephalitis attenuated live vaccine, and two doses of group A meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine).
Results
A total of 6589 subjects (including 3785 community children and 2804 hospital newborns) were included in this study; 97.34% of them received a timely first dose of HB vaccine (≤24h after birth) and 99.10% and 88.27% completed the HB vaccine series and the NIPV series, respectively. Among the 1680 children from eight counties who were rechecked, those with a timely first dose of HB vaccine had higher completion rates of the HB vaccine series and the NIPV series than those with a delayed first dose of HB vaccine (99.69% and 88.90% vs. 83.05% and 79.66%, respectively; both p<0.001). Compared to those with a delayed HB vaccine first dose, the odds ratios for completing the HB vaccine series and the NIPV series among children who received a timely first dose of HB vaccine were 65.96 (95% confidence interval (CI) 21.73–200.25) and 3.24 (95% CI 1.81–5.81), respectively.
Conclusions
Coverage with a timely first dose of HB vaccine is high in children in the community and newborns in hospital, and timely receipt of the first dose of HB vaccine is associated with an increased likelihood of completing the HB vaccine series and the NIPV series in Fujian, China."

Objective
The widespread use of antibiotics in humans and animals has contributed to growing rates of antibiotic resistance. Previously treatable bacterial infections now require the last line of antibiotics or are untreatable. The current antibiotic of last resort for carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections is often colistin. Evidence for the shifting pattern of colistin resistance and how the international community should respond are discussed in this review.
Methods
The literature on colistin resistance was reviewed.
Results
Plasmid-mediated colistin resistance encoded by mcr-1 was first documented in China during the routine surveillance of food animals. This has been followed by similar reports across a wide geographic area, in humans, animals, and the environment. The mcr-1 gene has been reported among human isolates in 29 countries, related to environmental samples in four countries, and in food animals and other animals in 28 countries. More recently, a second gene encoding resistance, mcr-2, has been isolated from porcine and bovine Escherichia coli.
Conclusion
The emergence and horizontal transmission of colistin resistance highlights the need for heightened stewardship efforts across the One Health platform for this antibiotic of last resort, and indeed for all antibiotics used in animals and humans."

keywords = "Dengue, Seroprevalence, Children, India, Community-based study, Socio-economic factors",
abstract = "Summary
Background
Dengue surveillance data in India are limited and probably substantially underestimate the burden of disease. A community-based study was undertaken to assess the prevalence of dengue-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in children across India and to examine historical dengue exposure rates. Potential associations between socio-economic factors and dengue seroprevalence were also assessed (registered at ctri.nic.in: CTRI/2011/12/002243).
Methods
A convenience sample of 2609 healthy children aged 5–10 years was enrolled; these children were registered at or were living in the vicinity of eight centres located at six geographically distinct sites across India. Blood samples were drawn to test for the presence of dengue IgG antibodies using ELISA. Serotype-specific neutralizing antibody titres were measured in dengue IgG-positive children using dengue plaque reduction neutralization tests. Socio-demographic and household information was collected using a questionnaire.
Results
Overall, 2558/2609 children had viable samples with laboratory results for dengue IgG. Dengue IgG seroprevalence across all sites was 59.6% (95% confidence interval 57.7–61.5%): the lowest (23.2%) was in Kalyani, West Bengal, and the highest (80.1%) was in Mumbai. Seroprevalence increased with age. Multivariate analysis suggested associations with household water storage/supply and type of housing. Half of the subjects with positive IgG results presented a multitypic profile, indicating previous exposure to more than one serotype.
Conclusions
The overall dengue seroprevalence suggests that dengue endemicity in India is comparable to that in highly endemic countries of Southeast Asia. Additional prospective studies are required to fully quantify the disease burden, in order to support evidence-based policies for dengue prevention and control in India."

In total, the cases of 507 pediatric patients seen over a 5-year period were analyzed; 220 of these cases were etiologically confirmed. These patients were classified into four age groups: 29 days to 1 year (n=373, 73.6%), 1–3 years (n=61, 12.0%), 3–6 years (n=41, 8.1%), and >6 years (n=32, 6.3%). The main pathogens identified in this study were Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=73, 33.2%), Escherichia coli (n=24, 10.9%), Enterococcus (n=22, 10.0%), and group B Streptococcus (n=18, 8.2%). All Gram-positive bacteria were sensitive to vancomycin and linezolid. All Gram-negative bacteria were sensitive to meropenem. The total non-susceptibility rate of S. pneumoniae to penicillin was 47.6% (20/42). The resistance rates to ceftriaxone, cefepime, and ceftazidime were 75% (9/12), 55.6% (5/9), and 40% (4/10), respectively.
Conclusions
The main pathogen of bacterial meningitis in this study was S. pneumoniae. The antibiotic resistance rates among children with bacterial meningitis are of serious concern."

Ergoferon is an antiviral complex drug containing released-active forms of antibodies to interferon gamma, CD4, and histamine. Its efficacy and safety in the treatment of acute respiratory viral infections has been reported previously. The aim of this study was to compare Ergoferon with oseltamivir.
Methods
A multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial of patients aged 18 to 65 years, who had tested positive for influenza A or B antigens, was performed. A total of 156 patients were enrolled as the intention-to-treat population; these patients were assigned randomly to receive either Ergoferon or oseltamivir (n=78 in each group).
Results
The percentage of patients achieving a normal body temperature (≤37.0°С) following 5 days of treatment did not differ significantly between the groups. The mean duration of fever in the Ergoferon and oseltamivir groups was 2.1±1.5 days and 2.3±1.6 days, respectively (p=0.01). The average time to the resolution of influenza symptoms was approximately 3 days, with no significant between-group difference. Total quality of life scores were similar in the two groups following 5 days of drug administration. The incidence of adverse events did not differ significantly between the groups, nor were there any serious adverse events.

Mycobacterium africanum comprises two phylogenetic lineages within the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC). M. africanum was first described and isolated in 1968 from the sputum of a Senegalese patient with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and it has been identified increasingly as an important cause of human TB, particularly prevalent in West Africa. The restricted geographical distribution of M. africanum, in contrast to the widespread global distribution of other species of MTBC, requires explanation. Available data indicate that M. africanum may also have important differences in transmission, pathogenesis, and host–pathogen interactions, which could affect the evaluation of new TB intervention tools (diagnostics and vaccines)–those currently in use and those under development. The unequal geographical distribution and spread of MTBC species means that individual research findings from one country or region cannot be generalized across the continent. Thus, generalizing data from previous and ongoing research studies on MTBC may be inaccurate and inappropriate. A major rethink is required regarding the design and structure of future clinical trials of new interventions. The West, Central, East, and Southern African EDCTP Networks of Excellence provide opportunities to take forward these pan-Africa studies. More investments into molecular, epidemiological, clinical, diagnostic, and immunological studies across the African continent are required to enable further understanding of host–M. africanum interactions, leading to the development of more specific diagnostics, biomarkers, host-directed therapies, and vaccines for TB."

Tuberculosis (TB)-related stigma is an important social determinant of health. Research generally highlights how stigma can have a considerable impact on individuals and communities, including delays in seeking health care and adherence to treatment. There is scant research into the assessment of TB-related stigma in low incidence countries. This study aimed to systematically map out the research into stigma. A particular emphasis was placed on the methods employed to measure stigma, the conceptual frameworks used to understand stigma, and whether structural factors were theorized. Twenty-two studies were identified; the majority adopted a qualitative approach and aimed to assess knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about TB. Few studies included stigma as a substantive topic. Only one study aimed to reduce stigma. A number of studies suggested that TB control measures and representations of migrants in the media reporting of TB were implicated in the production of stigma. The paucity of conceptual models and theories about how the social and structural determinants intersect with stigma was apparent. Future interventions to reduce stigma, and measurements of effectiveness, would benefit from a stronger theoretical underpinning in relation to TB stigma and the intersection between the social and structural determinants of health."

Objectives
To investigate the molecular epidemiology of Acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from different hospitals in Lebanon.
Methods
A total of 119 non-duplicate Acinetobacter strains were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and partial rpoB gene sequencing. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by disc diffusion method and all identified carbapenem-resistant isolates were investigated by PCR assays for the presence of the carbapenemase-encoding genes. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were used for molecular typing.
Results
Of the 119 A. baumannii isolates, 76.5% were resistant to carbapenems. The most common carbapenemase was the OXA-23-type, found in 82 isolates. The study of population structure using MLST revealed the presence of 30 sequence types (STs) including 18 new ones, with ST2 being the most commonly detected, accounting for 61% of the isolates typed. PFGE performed on all strains of ST2 identified a major cluster of 53 isolates, in addition to three other minor clusters and ten unique profiles.
Conclusions
This study highlights the wide dissemination of highly related OXA-23-producing carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii belonging to the international clone II in Lebanon. Thus, appropriate infection control measures are recommended in order to control the geographical spread of this clone in this country."

Objectives
About 2% of the world population is infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), a leading cause of hepatic cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The Niemann–Pick C1-like 1 cholesterol absorption receptor (NPC1L1) was recently identified to be an important factor for HCV entry into host cells. Whether genetic variations of the NPC1L1 gene are associated with HCV infection is unknown.
Methods
In this study, five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the NPC1L1 gene were analyzed in 261 HCV-infected individuals and 265 general controls from Yunnan Province, China.
Results
No significant differences were identified in genotypes or alleles of the SNPs between the two groups. After constructing haplotypes based on the five SNPs, a significant difference between HCV-infected individuals and general controls was shown for two haplotypes. Haplotype GCCTT appeared to be a protective factor and haplotype GCCCT was a risk factor for HCV-infected individuals. Genotypes of four SNPs correlated with biochemical characteristics of HCV-infected persons. Genotypes of SNPs rs799444 and rs2070607 were correlated with total bilirubin. Genotype TT of rs917098 was a risk factor for the gamma-glutamyltransferase level. Furthermore, HCV-infected individuals carrying genotype GG of rs41279633 showed statistically higher gamma-glutamyltransferase levels than HCV-infected persons with GT and TT.
Conclusion
The results of this study identified the association between genetic susceptibility of the NPC1L1 gene and HCV infection, as well as biochemical characteristics of HCV-infected persons in Yunnan, China."

The aim of this study was to determine whether N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) can predict impending brainstem encephalitis, pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage, cardiopulmonary failure, and death in children with severe enterovirus 71 (EV71)-associated hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD).
Methods
Plasma NT-proBNP levels of 282 children with severe EV71-associated HFMD were measured.
Results
NT-proBNP levels were significantly higher in patients with elevated blood glucose (>7.8 mmol/l) and increased white blood cell counts (>14×109/l). HFMD patients who had no complications had significantly lower NT-proBNP values than patients who died or had complications (p<0.05). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.73, 0.87, 0.91, 0.93, and 0.92 to discriminate between patients with and without brainstem encephalitis, pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage, circulatory failure, and death, respectively, using NT-proBNP. An NT-proBNP cut-off value of ≥1300pg/ml demonstrated a high sensitivity (85.00%) and specificity (93.51%) for predicting death in critical HFMD patients. Children with severe EV71-associated HFMD and NT-proBNP measurements ≥1300pg/ml had significantly worse overall survival compared to those with levels <1300pg/ml (p<0.05).
Conclusions
NT-proBNP levels may be able to predict complications and mortality in children with severe EV71-associated HFMD disease in the intensive care unit. Serum NT-proBNP values ≥1300pg/ml on admission could be indicative of circulatory failure and increased mortality."

Objectives
The identification of the specific pathogen responsible for a respiratory infection in patients with hematological malignancies (HM) would ensure relevant treatment and prevent toxicity associated with anti-infective therapy. This large-scale study aimed to explore the clinical impact of fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (FOB-BAL) in conjunction with molecular analysis on the diagnosis and management of respiratory infections in hemato-oncological patients.
Methods
All consecutive patients with HM and pulmonary infiltrates, who underwent FOB-BAL between January 2008 and January 2013, were included in the analysis. Clinical characteristics, FOB-BAL results, and treatment adjustments were recorded, and factors predicting a positive BAL were assessed.
Results
Four hundred and twenty-five FOB-BAL procedures were analyzed. BAL revealed a specific diagnosis in 219 (51.5%) patients, 208 of them with a pulmonary infection. Infectious etiological agents found were mainly Aspergillus spp (n=142), bacterial species (n=44), and Pneumocystis jirovecii (n=34). Multivariate analysis showed that a lymphoproliferative disease, ≥2 symptoms (dyspnea/cough/hemoptysis/pleuritic pain), and less than 4 days between symptom appearance and FOB-BAL, predicted a positive FOB-BAL result. BAL results prompted a treatment modification in 48% of subjects.
Conclusions
FOB-BAL in conjunction with molecular assays is efficient in the rapid detection of life-threatening infections, allowing for adjustment of anti-infective therapy, which may result in better outcomes and reduce treatment-related toxicity."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Antibiotics are often inappropriately prescribed for upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) in developed countries. Data on the proportion of inappropriate prescriptions are lacking from the Middle East and other developing countries.
Methods
Health insurance claims for all antibiotics prescribed for URTIs in the private sector in the State of Qatar between May 2014 and December 2015 were retrieved. During the study period, health insurance was limited to Qatari nationals. Topical antibiotics were excluded. Data on the prescriber's specialty, as listed with the licensing authority, were also retrieved. Diagnoses were classified as appropriate or inappropriate based on the likelihood of a bacterial etiology that may warrant antibiotic use.
Results
A total of 75 733 claims were made during the study period. Of these, 41 556 (55%) were for an appropriate indication, while 34 177 (45%) were for an inappropriate indication. The most common antibiotic classes prescribed were cephalosporins (43% of claims; 44% inappropriate), penicillins (28% of claims; 44% inappropriate), macrolides (19% of claims; 52% inappropriate), and fluoroquinolones (9% of claims; 40% inappropriate). Nearly 5% of antibiotics were prescribed in intravenous formulations. The most common prescribers were General/Family Practice physicians (53% of claims; 50% inappropriate), followed by Pediatrics (18.6% of claims; 36% inappropriate) and Internal Medicine (14.1% of claims; 44% inappropriate).
Conclusions
There is a high rate of inappropriate antibiotic prescription for acute URTIs in the private health care sector in the State of Qatar. Further studies are needed to determine the population-based rates across the country. Interventions to decrease inappropriate use in such settings are urgently needed."

Background
In 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that for efficiency and ethical considerations, transitioning from antenatal clinic-based surveillance to prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT)-based routine data should be investigated. An assessment of the readiness for this transition was carried out in Rwanda in 2011 and 2013.
Methods
This assessment applied the WHO recommended method. Individual HIV rapid testing at site was compared to antenatal surveillance results at all existing 30 sites, involving 13 292 women. In addition, PMTCT HIV testing quality assurance and PMTCT routine data quality were assessed at 27 out of the 30 sites.
Results
All sentinel sites provided PMTCT services and had a high uptake of HIV testing (more than 90%). At all sites, PMTCT data were recorded in longitudinal and standardized antenatal clinic registers. Twenty-six out of 27 sites had HIV result completeness above 90%. A positive percentage agreement of 97.5% and negative percentage agreement of 99.9% were observed between routine PMTCT and sero-surveillance HIV test results.

The study was performed from December 2013 to March 2014. Among the 123 patients from whom nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected, 59 tested positive by viral isolation as the gold standard method (influenza A, n=38; influenza B, n=21). For GOLD SIGN FLU, the sensitivities were 73.7% and 81.0%, and the specificities were 97.6% and 98.0% for influenza A and B, respectively. For Quick Navi-Flu, the sensitivities were 86.8% and 85.7%, and the specificities were 98.8% and 100% for influenza A and B, respectively. The time to the appearance of the line on the test strip was less than 3min for influenza A and less than 2min for influenza B with both RIDTs in more than 90% of cases. GOLD SIGN FLU was useful for diagnosing influenza A, and the result was readily available for influenza B particularly among adult patients. Quick Navi-Flu showed better sensitivities and specificities than GOLD SIGN FLU."

Objective
Seasonal variations in temperature exert strong selective pressure on microorganism population dynamics and should be taken into account in epidemiological studies. The objective of the present study was to characterize the seasonal variation of staphylococcal infections in respect to patient location, specimen source, month of year, and temperature variation.
Methods
A retrospective longitudinal time-series analysis of methicillin-resistant and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA and MSSA) was conducted in northeastern Ohio over a 5-year period. Multivariable time-series analyses were performed to detect the variations in the monthly incidence based on location of patients (inpatient, outpatient, and nursing homes), source of specimen (wound, respiratory tract, and urine), time of year (January–December), and temperature variation (average monthly over 5 years).
Results
The results indicated a gradual increase in both MRSA and MSSA infections, with outpatient cases representing the majority of cases. If present, the seasonal nature of MRSA infections varied based on specimen source and patient location, with wound infections from outpatients more prevalent in warmer months, and respiratory infections among inpatients more prevalent during colder months.
Conclusions
The current report provides a longitudinal analysis of staphylococcal epidemiology, and in the process, identifies the seasonal nature of infections to be multifactorial, depending on such variables as specimen source and patient location. The seasonal nature of staphylococcal infections appears to be the product of a complex interaction among host, pathogen, and environment."

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global public health problem, with 1.5 million deaths annually worldwide. One in five cases of TB present as extrapulmonary TB (EPTB), posing major diagnostic and management challenges. Mycobacterium tuberculosis adapts to a quiescent physiological state and is notable for its complex interaction with the host, producing poorly understood disease states ranging from latent infection to active clinical disease. New tools in the diagnostic armamentarium are urgently required for the rapid diagnosis of TB and monitoring of TB treatments, and to gain new insights into pathogenesis. The typical and atypical imaging features of EPTB are reviewed herein, and the roles of several imaging modalities for the diagnosis and management of EPTB are discussed."

Background
The clinical characteristics of internal medicine ward (IMW) patients with candidemia are unclear. The aim of this study was to define the clinical characteristics of candidemic IMW patients and to study the incidence, species distribution, and outcomes of these patients compared to surgical and intensive care unit (ICU) candidemic patients.
Methods
A retrospective cohort of candidemic patients in IMWs, general surgery wards, and an ICU at Beilinson Hospital during the period 2007–2014 was analyzed.
Results
A total of 118 patients with candidemia were identified in six IMWs, two general surgery wards, and one ICU in the hospital. Candida albicans was the leading causative agent (41.1%). Higher proportions of Candida parapsilosis and Candida tropicalis isolates were observed in the IMW patients. IMW patients were significantly older, with poorer functional capacity, and had more frequently been exposed to antibiotic therapy within 90 days, in particular β-lactam–β-lactamase inhibitor combinations and cephalosporins. At onset of candidemia, a significantly lower number of IMW patients were mechanically ventilated (p<0.01); these patients did not have central line catheters comparable to ICU and surgical patients (p<0.001). They were less likely to receive adequate antifungal therapy within 48h, and this was the only significant predictor of survival in these patients (p=0.028): hazard ratio 3.7 (95% confidence interval 1.14–12.5) for therapy delayed to >48h.
Conclusions
IMW candidemic patients account for a substantial proportion of candidemia cases and have unique characteristics and high mortality rates."

Background
Granulomatous mastitis (GM) is a chronic inflammatory breast lesion. Its etiology remains incompletely defined. Although mounting evidence suggests the involvement of Corynebacterium in GM, there has been no systematic study of GM bacteriology using -omics technology.
Methods
The bacterial diversity and relative abundances in breast abscesses from 19 women with GM were investigated using 16S rDNA metagenomic sequencing and Sanger sequencing. A quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay was also developed to identify Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii.
Results
A bioinformatic analysis revealed that Corynebacterium was present in the 19 GM patients, with abundances ranging from 1.1% to 58.9%. Of note, Corynebacterium was the most abundant taxon in seven patients (more than a third of the subjects). The predominance of Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii infection (11 of 19 patients, 57.9%) was confirmed with Sanger sequencing and the qPCR assay.
Conclusions
This study profiled the microbiota of patients with GM and indicated an important role for Corynebacterium, and in particular C. kroppenstedtii, in the pathogenesis of this disease."

Objectives
In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), many vaccine-preventable diseases are notifiable and are often reported despite high estimated immunization coverage. The serological assessment of immunity against these infections (serosurveillance) complements disease surveillance (notification). This study aimed to assess the yet unmeasured serological immunities to nine vaccine-preventable infections among vaccinated Emirati children.
Methods
This cross-sectional study involved children who attended the Well-Child Care Programme of the Ambulatory Healthcare Services (Al-Ain, UAE) between July 2014 and September 2015. Serological testing was performed in 227 Emirati children (49% females); subjects were aged (mean±standard deviation) 45±14 months (median 43, range 23–71 months).
Results
The seroprevalence rates varied markedly among the studied vaccine-preventable diseases, ranging from 39.2% (pertussis) to 98.3% (rubella). Other high seroprevalence rates were noted for measles (98.2%) and poliovirus (92%). The seroprevalence rate for mumps was 82.8%, for varicella was 68.3%, for diphtheria was 86.4%, for tetanus was 89.9%, and for Haemophilus influenzae type B was 84.1%.
Conclusions
A large number of the studied children had low seroprevalence rates against pertussis, varicella, and mumps. Studies are needed to explore whether modifying the national immunization programme could improve these low seroprevalence estimates."

Objective
Coordination of health interventions and research is often weak during periods of political transition and unprecedented aid inflows, which Cambodia has recently experienced. Although HIV, tuberculosis (TB), and malaria have been a focus of international funding, TB has received much less. This study compares the numbers and methodologies of studies conducted on TB, malaria, and HIV in Cambodia, identifying evidence gaps and future research needs.
Methods
Three electronic databases and the grey literature were searched for studies on HIV, TB, and malaria published between January 2000 and October 2015. Information about the disease focus and methodology was extracted from the studies included.
Results
A total of 2581 unique studies were screened and 712 were included in the analysis. The results of this review demonstrated that despite increasing numbers of publications, there have been fewer studies on TB (16%) than HIV (43%) and malaria (41%). Observational epidemiological studies outnumbered other methodologies (44%) for all three diseases.
Conclusions
Despite substantial investments, important research areas appear to have been neglected in Cambodia; specifically, studies on TB and studies involving economic, qualitative, interventional, and genomics methods. The inter-disease disparity in published research in Cambodia identified, considered alongside disease burden, suggests that an increase in TB research may be needed to inform control strategies."

Objectives
The re-emergence of the HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men (MSM) represents a serious health issue. This study aimed to assess the HIV prevalence among MSM in a very low prevalence population of a large city.
Methods
A public campaign to raise awareness of HIV infection and to provide access to anonymous testing was conducted in places frequented by MSM and through a mobile phone application. No identity information was requested from individuals contacting the call centre, and anonymous and free HIV testing was offered proactively. Those who agreed to have a test were provided a code number, which was used in blood sampling procedures.
Results
Of 1200 subjects who contacted the call centre, 197 consented to undergo HIV testing and visited the laboratory to give a blood sample. Twenty-five subjects were found to have a reactive ELISA result on two different occasions plus a positive Western blot test result. Thus, the HIV prevalence in this group of MSM was 12.7%.
Conclusions
MSM remain a high risk group for HIV infection in a low prevalence setting, and thus represent a key target population for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions."

We investigated the effect of CWPS and individual capsular polysaccharides, with regard to activation of subsets of immune cells of healthy controls. Three different capsular polysaccharides, CWPS and LPS were used for in vitro stimulation of whole blood. Cell activation (CD69 expression) was assessed in CD4+ and CD4- T cells, NK-like T cells, NK cells and monocytes by flow cytometry. Cytokine levels in supernatants were quantified by Cytometric Bead Array (CBA). CWPS and the capsules activated immune cell subsets, but to different degrees. NK cells and NK-like T cells showed the strongest activation, followed by monocytes. Among the three capsules, capsule type 23 induced the strongest activation and cytokine release, followed by type 9 and type 3.

More than 10% of the 34.5 million HIV-positive individuals worldwide are over the age of 50 years and the average age continues to increase. In the USA more than 50% of the 1.3 million people with HIV are over 50 years old and by the year 2030 it is estimated that 70% will be over the age of 50 years. Although the life expectancy of HIV-positive people has increased dramatically, it still lags behind that of HIV-negative individuals. There is controversy about whether HIV itself accelerates the aging process. Elevated rates of inflammation seen in people with HIV, even if their viral loads are suppressed and their CD4 counts are preserved, are associated with greater rates of cardiovascular, renal, neurocognitive, oncological, and osteoporotic disease. These conditions increase exponentially in the elderly and will represent a major challenge for HIV patients. In addition, conditions such as geriatric syndromes including frailty are also seen at higher rates. Management of the aging HIV patient includes an emphasis on early diagnosis and treatment, preventative measures for co-morbidities, and avoiding polypharmacy. Finally, the issue of quality of life, prioritization of medical issues, and end of life care become increasingly important as the patient grows older."

Ultrasound is increasingly used in point-of-care applications and has great potential to support the diagnosis of infectious diseases, especially in resource-limited settings. A cross-sectional study was performed involving 100 Malawian patients with a clinical indication for ultrasound. Furthermore, the literature on point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in Sub-Saharan Africa was reviewed to establish its applicability, most frequent indications, findings, and implications for treatment, and therefore relevance in POCUS curricula, with a main focus on infectious diseases. In Malawi, the main indications for ultrasound were weight loss, abdominal pain, and shortness of breath. Abnormal findings were observed in 77% of patients, the most common being enlarged abdominal lymph nodes (n=17), pericardial effusion (n=15), splenic microabscesses (n=15), and pleural effusion (n=14). POCUS led to a change in treatment in 72% of patients. The literature on the various POCUS applications used in Malawi was reviewed, including focused assessment with sonography for HIV-associated TB (FASH), heart, liver, kidney, deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and gynaecology. Based on disease prevalence, impact of POCUS on treatment, and technical difficulty, it is proposed that FASH, heart, and DVT are the most relevant POCUS applications in comparable Sub-Saharan African settings and should be incorporated in POCUS curricula."

The recent molecular epidemiology of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli infection in two Korean community hospitals was evaluated in this prospective observational study.
Methods
We collected non-duplicated E. coli isolates from consecutive, sequentially encountered patients with community-onset episodes between March and April 2016 in two community hospitals in Gyeonggi-do province, Korea. We studied the prevalence, clinical characteristics and molecular epidemiology of E. coli sequence type 131 (ST131) isolated from the community.
Results
From a total of 213 E. coli isolates collected from the community, 94 (44.1%) were community-onset healthcare-associated isolates and 119 (55.9%) were community-associated isolates, of which urinary tract infection was the majority. A total of 55 (25.8%) of the 213 E. coli isolates were confirmed to have ESBL genes, which were mainly CTX-M types such as CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-15. There was no difference in the proportion of globally epidemic ST131 clones or that of O25, O16, H30, or H30Rx subclones between community-associated and community-onset healthcare-associated isolates.

Background
Acute and chronic respiratory tract infections are a common cause of inappropriate antimicrobial prescription. Antimicrobial therapy leads to the development of resistance and the emergence of opportunistic pathogens that substitute the indigenous microbiota.
Methods
This review explores the major challenges and lines of research to adequately establish the clinical role of bacteria and the indications for antimicrobial treatment, and reviews novel therapeutic approaches.
Results
In patients with chronic pulmonary diseases and structural disturbances of the bronchial tree or the lung parenchyma, clinical and radiographic signs and symptoms are almost constantly present, including a basal inflammatory response. Bacterial adaptative changes and differential phenotypes are described, depending on the clinical role and niche occupied. The respiratory tract has areas that are potentially inaccessible to antimicrobials. Novel therapeutic approaches include new ways of administering antimicrobials that may allow intracellular delivery or delivery across biofilms, targeting the functions essential for infection, such as regulatory systems, or the virulence factors required to cause host damage and disease. Alternatives to antibiotics and antimicrobial adjuvants are under development.
Conclusions
Prudent treatment, novel targets, and improved drug delivery systems will contribute to reduce the emergence of antimicrobial resistance in lower respiratory tract infections."

Drug resistance development is an expected problem during treatment with protease inhibitors (PIs), this is largely due to the fact that Pls are low-genetic barrier drugs. Resistance-associated variants (RAVs) however may also occur naturally, and prior to treatment with Pls, the clinical impact of this basal resistance remains unknown. In Turkey, there is yet to be an investigation into the hepatitis C (HCV) drug associated resistance to oral antivirals.
Materials and methods
178 antiviral-naïve patients infected with HCV genotype 1 were selected from 27 clinical centers of various geographical regions in Turkey and included in the current study. The basal NS3 Pls resistance mutations of these patients were analyzed.
Results
In 33 (18.5%) of the patients included in the study, at least one mutation pattern that can cause drug resistance was identified. The most frequently detected mutation pattern was T54S while R109K was the second most frequently detected. Following a more general examination of the patients studied, telaprevir (TVR) resistance in 27 patients (15.2%), boceprevir (BOC) resistance in 26 (14.6%) patients, simeprevir (SMV) resistance in 11 (6.2%) patients and faldaprevir resistance in 13 (7.3%) patients were detected. Our investigation also revealed that rebound developed in the presence of a Q80K mutation and amongst two V55A mutations following treatment with TVR, while no response to treatment was detected in a patient with a R55K mutation.
Conclusion
We are of the opinion that drug resistance analyses can be beneficial and necessary in revealing which variants are responsible for pre-treatment natural resistance and which mutations are responsible for the viral breakthrough that may develop during the treatment."

Objective
This study aimed to assess the seroprevalence of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection and the potential risk factors for acquiring HEV infection in the seafood processing factories in Yantai City of Shandong Province, China.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted in five randomly selected seafood processing factories in Yantai City. Subjects were 15–66 years of age and were raw seafood processing workers, semi-finished products processing workers, and administrative staff, etc. Each participant completed a structured questionnaire and agreed to blood drawing. Anti-HEV IgG antibody was detected in the blood samples by ELISA method.
Results
A total of 1028 of 1044 eligible workers were tested for HEV IgG antibody (response rate 98.5%). The prevalence of HEV IgG seropositivity was found to be 22.20%. Occupation was significantly associated with anti-HEV IgG antibody seropositivity (p<0.05). Subjects who had direct contact with raw seafood had a higher anti-HEV IgG antibody prevalence (32.54%) than the semi-finished products processing workers (24.74%) and less exposed group (11.85%). HEV seroprevalence in the workers showed an increasing trend with the increase in working years, and this phenomenon was most obvious in raw seafood processing workers.
Conclusions
There is a higher risk of HEV infection in those who have direct contact with raw seafood. This study will help identify the risk factors for HEV infection and provide guidance on controlling HEV infection in the seafood processing occupations."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The early detection and identification of pathogens in central nervous system viral infections associated with neurological disease increases the survival rate. However, the limitations of current diagnostic methods contribute to a lack of proper diagnosis in 62% of patients. Therefore, a robust method for detecting multiple viruses in a single reaction with high specificity, throughput, and speed is required.
Methods
A multiplex PCR Mag-Array (MPMA) system was developed that integrates three strategies: chimeric primer design, temperature switch PCR, and MagPlex-TAG techniques. The MPMA was used to amplify 13 target viral sequences simultaneously, with plasmids containing specific viral sequences as standard samples. To evaluate its clinical performance, 177 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were tested.
Results
The MPMA system presented high specificity and efficiency in detecting a control panel of 13 plasmids. Among 177 CSF samples, consistent results were achieved for 19 samples pre-tested using a commercial kit. Viral pathogens were found in 28/138 undiagnosed samples, with herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1 and HSV-2) being predominant. The 20 non-infectious samples revealed negative results. Compared to sequencing methods, sensitivity for detecting HSV-1 and HSV-2 was 100% and 98.78%, respectively, and specificity was 100% and 98.22%, respectively.
Conclusions
A robust MPMA system that can simultaneously and reliably detect 13 meningoencephalitis-associated viruses with high specificity, throughput, and speed has been developed."

Background
Protein antigens comprising peptide motifs with high binding affinity to major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules are expected to induce a stronger cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response and thus provide better protection against infection with microorganisms where cytotoxic T-cells are the main effector arm of the immune system.
Methods
Data on cyst formation and survival were extracted from past studies on the DNA immunization of mice with plasmids coding for Toxoplasma gondii antigens. From in silico analyses of the vaccine antigens, the correlation was tested between the predicted affinity for MHC-I molecules of the vaccine peptides and the survival of immunized mice after challenge with T. gondii. ELISPOT analysis was used for the experimental testing of peptide immunogenicity.
Results
Predictions for the Db MHC-I molecule produced a strong, negative correlation between survival and the dissociation constant of vaccine-derived peptides. The in silico analyses of nine T. gondii antigens identified peptides with a predicted dissociation constant in the interval from 10nM to 40μM. ELISPOT assays with splenocytes from T. gondii-infected mice further supported the importance of the peptide affinity for MHC-I.
Conclusions
In silico analysis clearly helped the search for protective vaccine antigens. The ELISPOT analysis confirmed that the predicted T-cell epitopes were immunogenic by their ability to release interferon gamma in spleen cells."

Objectives
Controlled human infection, the intentional infection of healthy volunteers, allows disease pathogenesis to be studied and vaccines and therapeutic interventions to be evaluated in a controlled setting. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials of countermeasures for influenza that used the experimental human infection platform was performed. The primary objective was to document the scope of trials performed to date and the main efficacy outcome in the trials. The secondary objective was to assess safety and identify serious adverse events.
Methods
The PubMed database was searched for randomized controlled influenza human challenge studies with predetermined search terms. Review papers, papers without outcomes, community-acquired infections, duplicated data, pathogenesis studies, and observational studies were excluded.
Results
Twenty-six randomized controlled trials published between 1947 and 2014 fit the study inclusion criteria. Two-thirds of these trials investigated antivirals and one-third investigated influenza vaccines. Among 2462 subjects inoculated with influenza virus, the incidence of serious adverse events was low (0.04%). These challenge studies helped to down-select three antivirals and one vaccine that were subsequently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Conclusions
Controlled human infection studies are an important research tool in assessing promising influenza vaccines and antivirals. These studies are performed quickly and are cost-effective and safe, with a low incidence of serious adverse events."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Poliomyelitis is a highly infectious disease caused by poliovirus, which becomes difficult to manage/eradicate in politically unstable areas. The objectives of this study were to determine the movement and management of such polio outbreaks in endemic countries and countries with reoccurring cases of polio and to determine the effect of political instability on polio eradication.
Methods
In this study, the extent of polio outbreaks was examined and modeled using statistical methodologies and mapped with GIS software. Data on polio cases and immunization were collected for countries with polio cases for the period 2011 to 2014. Weekly data from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative were collected for selected countries. The recent virus origin and current movement was mapped using GIS. Correlations between immunization rates, the Global Peace Index (GPI), and other indicators of a country's political stability with polio outbreaks were determined. Data were analyzed using SAS 9.4 and ArcGIS 10.
Results
For several reasons, Pakistan remains highly vulnerable to new incidences of polio (306 cases in 2014). Overall immunization rates showed a steady decline over time in selected countries. Countries with polio cases were shown to have high rates of infant mortality, and their GPI ranked between 2.0 and 3.3; displaced populations, level of violent crime rating, and political instability also were ranked high for several countries.
Conclusion
Polio was shown to be high in areas with increased conflict and instability. Displaced populations living in hard-to-reach areas may lack access to proper vaccination and health care. Wars and conflict have also resulted in the reemergence of polio in otherwise polio-free countries."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Over 25000 pilgrims from the UK visit Saudi Arabia every year for the Umrah and Hajj pilgrimages. The recent outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in South Korea and the continuing reports of MERS-CoV cases from Saudi Arabia highlight the need for active surveillance for MERS-CoV in returning pilgrims or travellers from the Middle East. Public Health England Birmingham Laboratory (PHEBL) is one of a few selected UK public health laboratories responsible for MERS-CoV screening in travellers returning to the UK from the Middle East who present to hospital with severe respiratory symptoms. The results of the PHEBL MERS-CoV screening and surveillance over the past 3 years is presented.
Methods
UK travellers/pilgrims who returned from the Middle East and presented to a hospital with respiratory symptoms were studied over the period February 1, 2013 to December 31, 2015. Patients with respiratory symptoms, who satisfied the Public Health England MERS-CoV case algorithm, were tested for MERS-CoV and other respiratory tract viruses on admission to hospital.
Results
Two hundred and two patients suspected of having MERS-CoV were tested. None of them had a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection. A viral aetiology was detected in half (50.3%) of the cases, with rhinoviruses, influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2), and influenza B being most frequent. Peak testing occurred following the annual Hajj season and in other periods of raised national awareness.
Conclusions
Respiratory tract infections in travellers/pilgrims returning to the UK from the Middle East are mainly due to rhinoviruses, influenza A, and influenza B. Whilst MERS-CoV was not detected in the 202 patients studied, heightened awareness of the possibility of MERS-CoV and continuous proactive surveillance are essential to rapidly identify cases of MERS-CoV and other seasonal respiratory tract viruses such as avian influenza, in patients presenting to hospital. Early identification and isolation may prevent outbreaks in nosocomial settings."

There is currently an emerging outbreak of yellow fever in Angola. Cases in infected travellers have been reported in a number of other African countries, as well as in China, representing the first ever documented cases of yellow fever in Asia. There is a large Chinese workforce in Angola, many of whom may be unvaccinated, increasing the risk of ongoing importation of yellow fever into Asia via busy commercial airline routes. Large parts of the region are hyperendemic for the related Flavivirus dengue and are widely infested by Aedes aegypti, the primary mosquito vector of urban yellow fever transmission. The combination of sustained introduction of viraemic travellers, an ecology conducive to local transmission, and an unimmunized population raises the possibility of a yellow fever epidemic in Asia. This represents a major global health threat, particularly in the context of a depleted emergency vaccine stockpile and untested surveillance systems in the region. In this review, the potential for a yellow fever outbreak in Asia is discussed with reference to the ecological and historical forces that have shaped global yellow fever epidemiology. The limitations of surveillance and vector control in the region are highlighted, and priorities for outbreak preparedness and response are suggested."

Objectives
To determine the prevalence and the sociodemographic characteristics and sexual behavior risk factors for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in a hospital-based cohort of women in Saudi Arabia.
Methods
Cervical specimens and questionnaire data were collected from women attending clinics in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Cervical specimens were examined for abnormal cytology using a standard Pap test and for the presence of HPV-DNA using PCR and reverse line blot hybridization tests.
Results
Approximately 73% of the 400 women tested were Saudi nationals. Nearly 50% were under 40 years old (range 22–80 years, mean±standard deviation 41.20±10.43 years). Approximately 17% of the women were HPV-positive. The most commonly detected HPV types were HPV-18 (34%) and HPV-16 (19%), with multiple infections detected in 10% of positive specimens. Multivariate analyses revealed that smoking and multiple partners were significant risk factors for HPV infection (p<0.01).
Conclusions
Because of societal challenges and an unsubstantiated assumption of low HPV prevalence, few studies have examined sociodemographic characteristics or sexual behaviors associated with HPV in Saudi women. However, a high prevalence of HPV infection was found, with smoking and multiple partners as significant risk factors, in this hospital-based cohort of predominantly Saudi women."

abstract = "Summary
Background
De-escalation therapy is a strategy used widely to treat infections while avoiding the use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials. However, there is a paucity of clinical evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of de-escalation therapy compared to conventional therapy.
Methods
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted on de-escalation therapy for a variety of infections. A search of the MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases up to July 2015 for relevant studies was performed. The primary outcome was relevant mortality, such as 30-day mortality and in-hospital mortality. A meta-analysis was to be conducted for the pooled odds ratio using the random-effects model when possible. Both randomized controlled trials and observational studies were included in the analysis.
Results
A total of 23 studies were included in the analysis. There was no difference in mortality for most infections, and some studies favored de-escalation over non-de-escalation for better survival. The quality of most studies included was not high.
Conclusions
This review and analysis suggests that de-escalation therapy is safe and effective for most infections, although higher quality studies are needed in the future."

Objectives
The widespread epidemic of Zika virus infection in South and Central America and the Caribbean in 2015, along with the increased incidence of microcephaly in fetuses born to mothers infected with Zika virus and the potential for worldwide spread, indicate the need to review the current literature regarding vectors, reservoirs, and amplification hosts.
Vectors
The virus has been isolated in Africa in mosquitoes of the genera Aedes, Anopheles, and Mansonia, and in Southeast Asia and the Pacific area in mosquitoes of the genus Aedes. Aedes albopictus has invaded several countries in Central Africa and all Mediterranean countries, and continues to spread throughout Central and Northern Europe. The wide distribution of the virus in animal hosts and vectors favors the emergence of recombinants.
Animal hosts
The virus has been isolated in monkeys, and antibodies have been detected in domestic sheep, goats, horses, cows, ducks, rodents, bats, orangutans, and carabaos.
Conclusions
It is a public health imperative to define the domestic and wild animal reservoirs, amplification hosts, and vector capacity of the genera Aedes, Anopheles, and Mansonia. These variables will define the geographic distribution of Zika virus along with the indicated timing and scale of the environmental public health interventions worldwide."

Objective
To assess the influence of marital status and other correlates on HIV infection among women in Nigeria.
Methods
Data were extracted from the 2012 Nigerian population-based HIV/AIDS and reproductive health survey. The survey determined the HIV status of consenting women using standard procedures. Data were weighted and analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression at the 5% significance level.
Results
HIV prevalence among currently married and never married women was 3.4%, but was 5.9% among formerly married women. The odds of HIV infection were found to be 1.8 times higher among formerly married women compared with currently married women (odds ratio (OR) 1.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3–2.5) and never married women (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2–2.6). Also, the odds of HIV infection were 1.5 times higher among women who had made their sexual debut before the age of 15 years (adjusted OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1–2.1) compared with women who delayed it. The odds of HIV infection were 1.4 times higher among women who had recently had transactional sex (adjusted OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1–2.0) compared with others.
Conclusion
Being formerly married, under 15 years of age at first sex, and having engaged in transactional sex were found to be the strongest HIV risk factors among women. Besides empowering formerly married women and providing better social security, these women should be targeted in HIV programming and policies."

The Hajj and Umrah religious mass gatherings hosted by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia can facilitate the transmission of infectious diseases. The pilgrimages have been associated with a number of local and international outbreaks of meningococcal disease. These include serogroup A disease outbreaks in 1987 and throughout the 1990s and two international serogroup W135 outbreaks in 2000 and 2001. The implementation of strict preventative measures including mandatory quadrivalent meningococcal vaccination and antibiotic chemoprophylaxis for pilgrims from the African meningitis belt has prevented pilgrimage-associated meningococcal outbreaks since 2001. However, the fluid epidemiology of the disease and the possibility of outbreaks caused by serogroups not covered by the vaccine or emerging hyper-virulent strains, mean that the disease remains a serious public health threat during these events. Continuous surveillance of carriage state and the epidemiology of the disease in the Kingdom and globally and the introduction of preventative measures that provide broad and long-lasting immunity and impact carriage are warranted."

Background
The adverse effects of yellow fever (YF) vaccine in dialysis patients are not well known. There is concern about the risks and benefits of the vaccine in immunocompromised patients living in endemic areas, particularly given the risk of resurgence of urban YF with the spread of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The purpose of this study was to assess the coverage and safety of YF vaccine in chronic dialysis patients.
Methods
A cross-sectional study of 130 chronic dialysis patients was performed. Data were collected on clinical characteristics and YF vaccine status. Patients not vaccinated against YF or without a booster vaccination within the last 10 years were referred to receive the vaccine, and adverse effects were monitored.
Results
Previous vaccination was verified in 44 patients within the last 10 years and in 26 patients at more than 10 years ago, with no mention of adverse effects. Thirty-six patients had never been vaccinated and 24 had an unknown vaccination status. Of the total 86 patients referred for immunization, 45 actually received the YF vaccine, with 24.4% experiencing mild local adverse effects and 4.4% experiencing fever. No serious adverse effects attributable to YF vaccine were observed (anaphylaxis, neurological or viscerotropic disease).
Conclusions
YF vaccine coverage among hemodialysis patients is low, and the vaccine appeared to be safe in this population with a small sample size."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
There are currently 94 known pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide serotypes and their prevalence differs by geographic region and the period studied. Streptococcus pneumoniae infections have been diagnosed clinically in Trinidad and Tobago and other Caribbean countries, however data on the serotype and sequence type distributions in this country are limited. The objective of this study was to determine serotypes and multilocus sequence types (MLSTs) of invasive and non-invasive pneumococcal isolates from Trinidad and Tobago.
Methods
Ninety-eight pneumococcal isolates from several regional hospitals in the country were analyzed using both standard microbiological methods and molecular analysis. These isolates included invasive (n=83) and selected non-invasive (n=15) strains recovered before (n=25) and after (n=73) the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.
Results
More than half of the isolates (54.1%) were recovered from children under 15 years of age, with the largest proportion being from children under 2 years of age (24.5%). The most prevalent serotypes were 19F (18.4%), 6B (15.3%), 23F (14.3%), 3 (11.2%), 19A (6.1%), 6A (5.1%), 14 (5.1%), and 9V (4.1%). The most common serotype/MLST combinations were 6B/ST138 (n=10, 10.2%), 3/ST180 (n=5, 5.1%), 23F/ST629 (n=5, 5.1%), 19F/ST8398 (n=4, 4.1%), and three each of 6B/ST145, 14/9V/ST156, 9V/ST162, 19A/320, and 3/ST10440.
Conclusions
This report provides the first glimpse of the prevailing pneumococcal sequence types in the country. Most of the isolates represented serotypes in the 10-valent (61.2% of isolates) and 13-valent (83.7%) pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. A detailed population study is warranted to fully determine the circulating pneumococcal sequence types. Furthermore, the implementation of an effective and continuous surveillance system in Trinidad and Tobago is paramount to monitor vaccine impact."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Molecular tests show low sensitivity for smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). A screening and risk assessment system for smear-negative PTB using artificial neural networks (ANNs) based on patient signs and symptoms is proposed.
Methods
The prognostic and risk assessment models exploit a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and inspired adaptive resonance theory (iART) network. Model development considered data from 136 patients with suspected smear-negative PTB in a general hospital.
Results
MLP showed higher sensitivity (100%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 78–100%) than the other techniques, such as support vector machine (SVM) linear (86%; 95% CI 60–96%), multivariate logistic regression (MLR) (79%; 95% CI 53–93%), and classification and regression tree (CART) (71%; 95% CI 45–88%). MLR showed a slightly higher specificity (85%; 95% CI 59–96%) than MLP (80%; 95% CI 54–93%), SVM linear (75%, 95% CI 49–90%), and CART (65%; 95% CI 39–84%). In terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), the MLP model exhibited a higher value (0.918, 95% CI 0.824–1.000) than the SVM linear (0.796, 95% CI 0.651–0.970) and MLR (0.782, 95% CI 0.663–0.960) models. The significant signs and symptoms identified in risk groups are coherent with clinical practice.
Conclusions
In settings with a high prevalence of smear-negative PTB, the system can be useful for screening and also to aid clinical practice in expediting complementary tests for higher risk patients."

The risk of acquisition and transmission of respiratory infections is high among attendees of mass gatherings (MGs). Currently used interventions have limitations yet the role of facemask in preventing those infections at MG has not been systematically reviewed. We have conducted a systematic review to synthesise evidence about the uptake and effectiveness of facemask against respiratory infections in MGs.
Methods
A comprehensive literature search was conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines using major electronic databases such as, Medline, EMBASE, SCOPUS and CINAHL.
Results
Of 25 studies included, the pooled sample size was 12710 participants from 55 countries aged 11 to 89 years, 37% were female. The overall uptake of facemask ranged from 0.02% to 92.8% with an average of about 50%. Only 13 studies examined the effectiveness of facemask, and their pooled estimate revealed significant protectiveness against respiratory infections (relative risk [RR]=0.89, 95% CI: 0.84-0.94, p<0.01), but the study end points varied widely.
Conclusion
A modest proportion of attendees of MGs use facemask, the practice is more widespread among health care workers. Facemask use seems to be beneficial against certain respiratory infections at MGs but its effectiveness against specific infection remains unproven."

Objectives
To evaluate knowledge, attitude, and practices of community pharmacists towards dispensing antibiotics without prescription (DAwP) in Makkah Province, Saudi Arabia.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey was conducted between January and February 2016 using a structured, validated, and pilot-tested questionnaire. A four-step systematic approach was used to recruit community pharmacists who completed a 28-item questionnaire either in English or Arabic language based on their personal preference.
Results
Of the 200 community pharmacists approached, 189 completed the questionnaire. More than two-thirds (70.5%) of the pharmacists were not aware that DAwP is illegal practice. Lack of patient willingness to consult a physician for a non-serious infection (69.9%) and an inability to afford a consultation with a physician (65.3%) were the most common reasons cited for DAwP. A statistically significant association was found between the number of antibiotics dispensed and educating patients about the importance of adherence and completion of the full course of antibiotics (p=0.007).
Conclusions
In general, community pharmacists have a poor understanding of the regulations prohibiting the over-the-counter sale of antibiotics in Saudi Arabia, explaining the high rate of DAwP in the country. A multifaceted approach consisting of educational interventions and improving the access to and affordability of healthcare facilities for the general public is required to effectively reduce DAwP and its negative consequences on public health."

Mass gatherings at religious events can pose major public health challenges, particularly the transmission of infectious diseases. Every year the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) hosts the Hajj pilgrimage, the largest gathering held on an annual basis where over 2 million people come to KSA from over 180 countries. Living together in crowded conditions exposes the pilgrims and the local population to a range infectious diseases. Respiratory and gastrointestinal tract bacterial and viral infections can spread rapidly and affect attendees of mass gatherings. Lethal infectious disease outbreaks were common during Hajj in the 19th and 20th centuries although they have now been controlled to a great extent by the huge investments made by the KSA into public health prevention and surveillance programs. The KSA provides regular updated Hajj travel advice and health regulations through international public health agencies such as the WHO, Public Health England, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Hajj travel agencies. During the Hajj, an additional 25 000 health workers are deployed; there are eight hospitals in Makkah and Mina complete with state-of-the-art surgical wards and intensive care units made specifically available for pilgrims. All medical facilities offer high quality of care, and services are offered free to Hajj pilgrims to ensure the risks of ill health to all pilgrims and KSA residents are minimal. A summary of the key health issues that arise in pilgrims from Europe during Hajj and of the KSA Hajj guidelines, together with other factors that may play a role in reducing the risks to pilgrims and to wider global health security, is provided herein."

abstract = "Summary
Sexually acquired hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains a public health problem, with significant disease burden primarily in HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM). Over the past decades, the epidemic of sexually transmitted HCV infection has continued to expand and the epidemiology of HCV in HIV has changed significantly. In the post-combination antiretroviral therapy era, sexual network characteristics within the specific core group of MSM with increased sexual risk behaviours, including serosorting on the basis of HIV-positive status and intense mucosally traumatic sexual practices, confer increased HCV acquisition and transmission. This review summarizes the current epidemiology of sexually acquired HCV infection and the clinical and immunological contexts of acute HCV infection, and describes the biological, social, and behavioural factors that have facilitated permucosal transmission of HCV in MSM. While the advent of direct-acting antivirals has improved treatment responses significantly, sexually transmitted HCV reinfections occur in a substantial proportion of HIV-positive MSM following clearance of a primary infection. Effective strategies and preventive interventions that are tailored to the MSM communities to facilitate the control of sexually acquired HCV infection cannot be overemphasized."

Background
The surveillance of infection is very important for public health management and disease control. It has been 10 years since China implemented its new web-based infection surveillance system, which covers the largest population in the world.
Methods
In this study, time series data were collected for 28 infectious diseases reported from 2005 to 2014 . Seasonality and long-term trends were explored using decomposition methods. Seasonality was expressed by calculating the seasonal indices. Long-term trends in the diseases were assessed using a linear regression model on the deseasonalized series.
Results
During the 10-year period, 38 982 567 cases and 126 372 deaths were reported in the system. The proportion of deaths caused by AIDS increased from 12% in 2005 to 78% in 2014. There were six diseases for which the seasonal index range was greater than 2: dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, leptospirosis, anthrax, cerebrospinal meningitis, and measles . Among the 28 diseases, the incidence of syphilis increased fastest, with an average increase of 0.018626/100 000 every month after adjustment for seasonality.
Conclusions
Effective surveillance is helpful in gaining a better understanding of the infection behaviour of infectious diseases; this will greatly facilitate disease control and management."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Few studies have investigated serum levels of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). The present study aimed to determine whether PDGF-BB could serve as a potential biomarker for the detection of liver fibrosis.
Methods
From October 2013 to August 2015, 465 patients with CHB were enrolled prospectively in this study. All patients underwent liver biopsy and staging based on the Ishak system. The serum PDGF-BB level was measured quantitatively by ELISA.
Results
The serum PDGF-BB level was negatively correlated with fibrosis stage in all patients (p = 0.003, Spearman's rho=−0.16) and was significantly different between fibrosis stages. The areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUROCs) for serum PDGF-BB level and PGT score (a combination of PDGF-BB, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and platelet levels) were 0.667 and 0.831, respectively, for patients with significant fibrosis and normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. The AUROCs for aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio (APRI) and fibrosis index based on four factors (FIB-4) were 0.823 and 0.821, respectively. Importantly, a cut-off value of 1.05 and 1.43, respectively, resulted in a sensitivity of 0.95 and 0.52, a specificity of 0.29 and 0.95, a positive predictive value of 0.30 and 0.79, and a negative predictive value of 0.96 and 0.86. The rate of correct diagnosis was up to 88.4% when using cut-offs of 1.05 and 1.43 for the absence or presence of significant fibrosis, respectively.
Conclusions
Serum PDGF-BB decreased remarkably as fibrosis progressed, and this could be used as a non-invasive biomarker for the assessment of fibrosis stage in patients with CHB."

Background
Namibia experienced a large measles outbreak starting in 2009, with 38% of reported cases in adults, including women of reproductive age. Population immunity was assessed among pregnant women to determine whether immunization activities were needed in adults to achieve measles elimination in Namibia.
Methods
A total of 1708 and 2040 specimens sampled from Namibian pregnant women aged 15–44 years who were included in the 2008 and 2010 National HIV Sentinel Survey, respectively, were tested for measles immunoglobulin G antibody. The proportion of women seropositive overall and by 5-year age strata was determined, and factors associated with seropositivity were analyzed by logistic regression, including age, facility type, gravidity, HIV status, and urban/rural setting. Seropositivity in 2008 versus 2010 was compared.
Results
In both analysis years, measles seropositivity was lower in 15–19-year-olds (77%) and 20–24-year-olds (85–87%) and higher in 25–44-year-olds (90–94%) (2008, p<0.001; 2010, p<0.001). Overall measles seropositivity did not differ between 2008 (87%) and 2010 (87%) (p=0.7). HIV status did not affect seropositivity.
Conclusions
Late in a large measles outbreak, 13% of pregnant women in Namibia, and almost one in four 15–19-year-old pregnant women, remained susceptible to measles. In Namibia, immunization campaigns with measles-containing vaccine should be considered for adults."

HBV infection typically leads to chronic hepatitis in newborns and some adults with weakened immune systems. The mechanisms by which virus escapes immunity remain undefined. Regulatory dendritic cells (DCregs) contributing to immune escape have been described. We wondered whether or not HBeAg as an immunomodulatory protein could induce DCreg which might subsequently result into HBV persistence.
Methods
The immunophenotyping, T-cell activation and cytokine production were analyzed in HBeAg-treated DCs from normal or cyclophosphamide (Cy)-induced immunocompromised mice.
Results
HBeAg tended to promote bone marrow derived DCs (BMDCs) from Cy-treated mice into CD11bhighPIR-B+ regulatory DCs exhibiting the lowest T-cell stimulatory capacity and interleukin (IL)-12p70 production compared with controls. Neutralization of IL-10 significantly inhibited the regulatory effect of these DCs on T-cell stimulation of mature DCs. After lipopolysaccharides (LPS) stimulation, marked phosphorylation of Akt was detected in HBeAg treated DCs from immunocompromised mice. Blocking the PI3K-Akt pathway by LY294002 led to an enhancement of IL-12 production. PI3K signalling pathway appears to be involved in the decreased IL-12 secretion by HBeAg treated DCs.
Conclusions
These findings suggest that HBeAg may program the generation of a new DC subset with regulatory capacity under the condition of immunosuppression, which may presumably contribute to the persistent HBV infection."

Objective
Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) are two types of pulmonary fungal infection that are not easy to differentiate. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of inflammatory cytokines in the differential diagnosis of IPA and PCP.
Methods
A total of 227 pediatric oncology patients diagnosed with acute pneumonia were enrolled. They were divided into three groups: IPA, PCP, and ‘others’. The cytokine levels in these groups were compared, including interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6, IL-4, and IL-2.
Results
Of the six cytokines, only IL-6 and IFN-γ levels were elevated in patients with acute pneumonia. IL-6 was comparable between patients with IPA and PCP (52.0 pg/ml vs. 25.8 pg/ml, p=0.092), while IFN-γ was much higher in patients with PCP (19.9 pg/ml vs. 8.9 pg/ml, p=0.001). The accuracy of IL-6 and the ratio of IL-6/IFN-γ in predicting IPA were 69.0% and 72.0%, respectively, while the accuracy of IFN-γ to predict PCP was 67.2%. IL-6 >140 pg/ml and IL-6/IFN-γ >9.0 presented specificities of 90% in predicting IPA, while IFN-γ >40 pg/ml presented specificity of 90% in predicting PCP.
Conclusions
IL-6 is predominantly elevated in IPA, while IFN-γ is significantly increased in PCP. These are helpful tools for the differential diagnosis of IPA and PCP."

abstract = "Background
Infections caused by drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) are increasing worldwide and as a result, the selection of appropriate empiric antibiotics (ATBs) has been made increasingly difficult. The present study aimed to identify optimized dosing regimens of intravenous (IV) ATBs, defined by cumulative fraction response (CFR), against E. coli (EC), K. pneumoniae (KP), P. aeruginosa (PA), and A. baumannii (AB) at 2,300-bed University Hospital.
Materials and Methods
The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of EC, KP, PA, and AB from clinical specimens, 250 each, were determined. Pharmacodynamic profiling using Monte Carlo Simulation was performed for standard, high dosage, and prolonged infusions (PI) of ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, meropenem, and doripenem. A CFR of ≥90% was targeted as providing a sufficiently high ATB exposure.
Results
When considering the Enterobacteriaceae, the % susceptible for the cephalosporins ranged from 60% for ceftriaxone to 86% for cefepime, as a result only the 2g q8h regimens of ceftazidime and cefepime provided high CFRs. In contrast, all the carbapenems had % susceptible and CFRs ≥90% for EC and KP. While cefepime and ceftazidime demonstrated higher % susceptibility (82-83%) for PA relative to that of the carbapenems (61-69%) only doripenem 2g q8h (4h PI) achieved an optimal CFR (92%) against this organism. Due to the MIC profiles and dismal susceptibilities of AB (16-22%), none of the regimens studied achieved CFRs > 65%.
Conclusions
The pharmacodynamic profiling undertaken in the current study provides insights that allow prescribers to select more appropriate empirical antibiotic regimens for the treatment of infection caused by these common GNB pathogens at this Thai hospital. While higher doses and PI of β-lactams improve exposures against EC, KP and PA, this approach will not sufficiently enhance their potency against AB, thus alternative therapies should be considered for this organism."

Mass gatherings of people at religious pilgrimages and sporting events are linked to numerous health hazards, including the transmission of infectious diseases, physical injuries, and an impact on local and global health systems and services. As with other forms of disaster, mass gathering-related disasters are the product of the management of different hazards, levels of exposure, and vulnerability of the population and environment, and require comprehensive risk management that looks beyond single hazards and response. Incorporating an all-hazard, prevention-driven, evidence-based approach that is multisectoral and multidisciplinary is strongly advocated by the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030.

Background
Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most severe form of tuberculosis. Microbiological confirmation is rare and treatment is often delayed. Early diagnosis and immediate initiation of treatment are essential for effective TBM control. A systematic review was performed in this study to assess the diagnostic accuracy of detecting antibodies against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), according to standard methods. Test performance was summarized using a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis.
Methods
Studies were identified by a search of the literature, up to July 25, 2015, in the EMBASE and MEDLINE databases via Ovid SP and PubMed. The Cochrane Library was also searched for original, peer-reviewed molecular epidemiology studies that reported the diagnosis of TBM based on antibody detection in the CSF.
Results
Thirty-six articles (58 studies) were identified. The sensitivity of antibody detection was 0.75 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66–0.82), specificity was 0.98 (95% CI 0.96–0.99), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was 0.97 (95% CI 0.95–0.98). By subgroup analysis, the detection of anti-M37Ra was the highest (AUROC 0.99, 95% CI 0.98–1.00), followed by anti-antigen 5 (AUROC 0.99, 95% CI 0.97–0.99) and anti-M37Rv (AUROC 0.97, 95% CI 0.95–0.98).
Conclusions
For the early diagnosis of TBM based on antibodies in the CSF, the detection of anti-M37Ra, anti-antigen 5, or anti-M37Rv provides the greatest sensitivity and specificity."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The reason for the high prevalence of epilepsy in onchocerciasis endemic areas remains unknown. The aim of this study was to detect risk factors associated with epilepsy in a region endemic for onchocerciasis.
Methods
In June 2014, a case–control study was performed in Titule, Bas-Uélé Province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Individuals with unprovoked convulsive epilepsy of unknown aetiology were enrolled as cases (n=59). Healthy members of families without cases of epilepsy in the same village were recruited as controls (n=61). A multivariate binomial logistic regression analysis was performed to identify potential risk factors associated with epilepsy. To evaluate the potential protective effect of ivermectin treatment on the development of epilepsy, a nested age-matched case–control study was performed including only those who were eligible for ivermectin treatment in the year before they developed epilepsy.
Results
Suspected onchocerciasis skin lesions were more often present in cases than in controls: 12/41 (29%) vs. 1/56 (2%), respectively (odds ratio (OR) 20.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.42–170; p<0.01). Ivermectin had been taken 7 months earlier in 29/59 (49%) cases and 29/61 (48%) controls. Onchocerca volvulus (OV) DNA was detected by PCR in skin snips in 26/34 cases (76%) and 10/14 controls (71%) (p=0.7), and there was presence of OV IgG4 antibodies in 35/48 (73%) cases and 15/18 (83%) controls (p=0.5). OV DNA was not detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of cases (controls not tested). Both cases and controls reported frequent bites by blackflies (Diptera, Simuliidae). Bathing daily as opposed to less often (OR 16.7, 95% CI 2.2–125.8; p<0.01), bathing between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. (OR 12.7, 95% CI 1.6–103.7; p=0.02), and washing clothes between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. (OR 10.9, 95% CI 1.5–77.3; p=0.02) were all independently associated with epilepsy. Blood screening by specific PCR tests for Toxoplasma and Wuchereria bancrofti was negative in all cases and controls. A Loa loa infestation was found in only one case and one control by PCR and Giemsa smear. Antibodies to Taenia solium, Toxocara, and Trypanosoma sp were not detected in any of the participants. In an age-matched case–control analysis, 16/18 (89%) cases had not taken ivermectin the year before they developed epilepsy, compared to 7/18 (39%) controls that same year (p=0.002).
Conclusions
These data suggest that frequent activities at rivers known to be blackfly breeding sites and a historical lack of ivermectin treatment were risk factors for epilepsy in this onchocerciasis endemic area."

Objectives
To describe the incidence, mortality, cost, and length of stay (LOS) of hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in three Southeast Asian countries: Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.
Methods
Using Casemix system data from contributing hospitals, patients with International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) codes identifying pneumonia were categorized into CAP or HAP using a logical algorithm. The incidence among hospitalized patients, case fatality rates (CFR), mean LOS, and cost of admission were calculated. The population incidence was calculated based on Malaysian data.
Results
For every 100000 discharges, CAP and HAP incidences were 14245 and 5615 cases, respectively, in the Philippines, 4205 and 2187, respectively, in Malaysia, and 988 and 538, respectively, in Indonesia. The impact was greatest in the young and the elderly. The CFR varied from 1.4% to 4.2% for CAP and from 9.1% and 25.5% for HAP. The mean LOS was 6.1–8.6 days for CAP and 6.9–10.2 days for HAP. The cost of hospitalization was between USD 254 and USD 1208 for CAP and between USD 275 and USD 1482 for HAP.
Conclusions
The burden of CAP and HAP is high. Results varied between the three countries, likely due to differences in socio-economic conditions, health system differences, and ICD-coding practices."

Depending on their destinations and activities, international travellers are at a significant risk of contracting both communicable and non-communicable diseases. On return to their home countries, such travellers may require intensive care. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and more recently Ebola haemorrhagic fever, has highlighted the risks. Other well-known communicable pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae have been described previously. However, malaria remains by far the most important cause of death. The issues related to imported antibiotic resistance and protection from highly contagious diseases are reviewed here. Surveillance strategies based on epidemiological data (country visited, duration of travel, and time elapsed since return) and clinical syndromes, together with systematic search policies, are usually mandatory to limit the risk of an outbreak. Single-bed hospital rooms and isolation according to symptoms should be the rule while awaiting laboratory test results. Because person-to-person contact is the main route of transmission, healthcare workers should implement specific prevention strategies."

Methods
We examined national TB and HIV notification data to provide a geographic overview and describe relevant disease trends within Vietnam. We also compared the demographic and clinical profiles of TB patients with and without HIV infection.
Results
During the past 10 years (2005–2014) cumulative HIV case numbers and deaths increased to 298,151 and 71,332 respectively, but access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) improved and new infections and deaths declined. From 2011-2014 routine HIV testing of TB patients increased from 58.9% to 72.5% and of all TB patients diagnosed with HIV in 2014, 2,803 (72.4%) received ART. The number of multidrug resistant (MDR)-TB cases enrolled for treatment increased almost 3-fold (578 to 1,532) from 2011-2014. The rate of HIV co-infection in MDR and non-MDR TB cases (51/1,532; 3.3% vs 3,774/100,555; 3.8%; OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.7–1.2) was similar in 2014.
Conclusions
The care of TB/HIV co-infected patients have shown sustained improvement in Vietnam. Rising numbers of MDR-TB cases is a concern, but this is not “driven” by HIV co-infection."

Objectives
Sex workers face stigma, discrimination, and violence across the globe and are almost 14 times more likely to be HIV-infected than other women in low- and middle-income countries. In Asia, condom campaigns at brothels have been effective in some settings, but for preventive interventions to be sustainable, it is important to understand micro-level social and structural factors that influence sexual behaviours of sex workers. This study assessed the syndemic effects of micro-level social and structural factors of unprotected sex and the prevalence of HIV among female sex workers (FSWs) in Nepal.
Methods
This quantitative study included 610 FSWs who were recruited using two-stage cluster sampling from September to November 2012 in 22 Terai Highway districts of Nepal. Rapid HIV tests and face-to-face interviews were conducted to collect biological and behavioural information. A count of physical (sexual violence and other undesirable events), social (poor social support and condom negotiation skills), and economic (unprotected sex to make more money) factors that operate at the micro-level was calculated to test the additive relationship to unprotected sex.
Results
The HIV prevalence was 1%; this is presumably representative, with a large sample of FSWs in Nepal. The prevalence of unprotected sex with clients was high (24%). For each additional adverse physical, social, and economic condition, the probability of non-use of condoms with clients increased substantially: one problem = 12% (p<0.005), two problems = 19% (p<0.001), and three to five problems = 38% (p<0.001).
Conclusions
Interactions between two or more adverse conditions linked to physical, social, and economic environments increased the risk of unprotected sex among Nepalese FSWs."

It was hypothesized that 20-min delayed contrast-enhanced CT images would be sufficient to optimize the detection of brain pathologies and that no additional delayed images would be necessary. Twenty-six adult patients with AIDS and brain pathologies were enrolled and had their cranial CT images analyzed by three evaluators. The numbers of lesions identified at two predetermined delayed time-points were compared. There was no variation in the number of lesions depicted by each evaluator, between the 20-min delayed contrast-enhanced CT image and the image obtained at the other predetermined delayed time-point."

Objectives
This study aimed to examine the changes in HIV demographics over time in an exceptionally low prevalence population, with particular emphasis on men who have sex with men (MSM).
Methods
A total of 1292 newly diagnosed HIV-positive patients registered in the ACTHIV-IST Study Group database between 2000 and 2014 were included. The changes occurring over time in the characteristics of patients at the time of initial admission were examined retrospectively.
Results
A gradual increase in the total number of newly diagnosed patients was evident during the study period; however, it was not possible to show an increase in the proportion of MSM within the study population (p=0.63). There was a male predominance throughout the study (85% vs. 15%), with further increases in the proportion of males in recent years. The mean age was lower at the end of the study (p<0.05) and there was an increase in the number of unmarried patients (p<0.05).
Conclusions
Sexual preference patterns of HIV patients in extremely low prevalence populations may be different, possibly due to an early phase of the epidemic. Nevertheless, MSM still represent a target subgroup for interventions, since they account for a substantial proportion of cases and a resurgent epidemic may be expected among this group in later phases of the epidemic."

Background
The HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Western China is substantial and increasing at an alarming rate. The current HIV infection prevalence among MSM in Western China and its associated risk characteristics were explored by looking at different anal sexual roles separately.
Methods
A total 1245 MSM recruited by convenience sampling from multiple sources and areas in the Chongqing and Sichuan region were interviewed using an anonymous self-administered questionnaire with the assistance of investigators and then underwent HIV testing. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors independently associated with HIV infection.
Results
Of the 1235 respondents who reported their sexual roles during anal sex with men, the overall HIV antibody positive rate was 21.21% (262/1235). With regard to the different anal sex roles, HIV-positive rates were significantly higher among men who played the ‘0.5’ role (versatile, equal) and ‘0’ role (only bottom or versatile, but mostly bottom) during anal sex with men than among those who played the ‘1’ role (only top or versatile, but mostly top) (26.41% for ‘0.5’ role, 26.20% for ‘0’ role, and 15.19% for ‘1’ role; Chi-square=22.66, p<0.0001). Statistically significant differences were not found between the ‘0.5’ role and ‘0’ role groups (p > 0.05). The ‘1’ role MSM who had an education level lower than senior high school, a rural household registration, and low self-perceived severity status of AIDS, the ‘0.5’ role MSM who had an education level lower than senior high school and had not undergone HIV testing in the recent 1 year, and the ‘0’ role MSM who were retired or unemployed and had been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease by a doctor in the recent 6 months were more likely to be HIV-infected.
Conclusions
In this study, the HIV prevalence among MSM was alarmingly high. Moreover, the ‘0.5’ and ‘0’ role MSM were found to have a higher risk of infection compared to the ‘1’ role MSM, while respective risk characteristics were not completely the same across the three groups. Along with routine preventive intervention services, more focused and specific interventions are needed to target anal sex role classes separately."

The genus Corynebacterium represents a taxon of Gram-positive bacteria with a high G+C content in the genomic DNA. Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii is an unusual member of this taxon as it lacks the characteristic mycolic acids in the cell envelope. Genome sequence analysis of the C. kroppenstedtii type strain has revealed a lipophilic (lipid-requiring) lifestyle and a remarkable repertoire of carbohydrate uptake and utilization systems. Clinical isolates of C. kroppenstedtii have been obtained almost exclusively from female patients and mainly from breast abscesses and cases of granulomatous mastitis. However, the role of C. kroppenstedtii in breast pathologies remains unclear. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the taxonomy, microbiology, and microbiological identification of C. kroppenstedtii, including polyphasic phenotypic approaches, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and the use of 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A clinical review presents reported cases, various antimicrobial treatments, antibiotic susceptibility assays, and antibiotic resistance genes detected during genome sequencing. C. kroppenstedtii must be considered a potential opportunistic human pathogen and should be identified accurately in clinical laboratories."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Previous research has suggested that avian influenza A H7N9 has a greater potential pandemic risk than influenza A H5N1. This research investigated the difference in human clustered and sporadic cases of H7N9 virus and estimated the relative risk of clustered infections.
Methods
Comparative epidemiology and virology studies were performed among 72 sporadic confirmed cases, 17 family clusters (FCs) caused by human-to-human transmission, and eight live bird market clusters (LCs) caused by co-exposure to the poultry environment.
Results
The case fatality of FCs, LCs and sporadic cases (36%, 26%, and 29%, respectively) did not differ among the three groups (p>0.05). The average age (36 years, 60 years, and 58 years), co-morbidities (31%, 60%, and 54%), exposure to birds (72%, 100%, and 83%), and H7N9-positive rate (20%, 64%, and 35%) in FCs, LCs, and sporadic cases, respectively, differed significantly (p<0.05). These higher risks were associated with increased mortality. There was no difference between primary and secondary cases in LCs (p>0.05). However, exposure to a person with confirmed avian influenza A H7N9 (primary 12% vs. secondary 95%), history of visiting a live bird market (100% vs. 59%), multiple exposures (live bird exposure and human-to-human transmission history) (12% vs. 55%), and median days from onset to antiviral treatment (6 days vs. 3 days) differed significantly between primary and secondary cases in FCs (p<0.05). Mild cases were found in 6% of primary cases vs. 32% of secondary cases in FCs (p<0.05). Twenty-five isolates from the three groups showed 99.1–99.9% homology and increased human adaptation.
Conclusions
There was no statistical difference in the case fatality rate and limited transmission between FCs and LCs. However, the severity of the primary cases in FCs was much higher than that of the secondary cases due to the older age and greater underlying disease of the latter patients."

abstract = "Objectives
People who inject drugs are at high risk of HIV infection but often face barriers in accessing medical care including access to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Evidence is available about the effectiveness of opioid agonist therapy on drug dependency and risk behaviors. However, it remains scattered regarding access to ART among HIV-positive people who inject drugs. We conducted a systematic review to examine the association of opioid agonist therapy with ART initiation among HIV-positive people who inject drugs.
Methods
We searched the literature for evidence from seven databases. We conducted a narrative synthesis and meta-analysis to examine the association of opioid agonist therapy with ART initiation.
Results
Five out of 2,901 identified studies met the inclusion criteria. Three out of five studies reported that, HIV-positive people receiving opioid agonist therapy initiated ART more than those not receiving opioid agonist therapy. In meta-analysis, opioid agonist therapy was associated with ART initiation among HIV positive people who inject drugs (pooled odds ratio: 1.68; 95% confidence interval: 1.03–2.73).
Conclusions
Opioid agonist therapy is positively associated with ART initiation among HIV-positive people who inject drugs. It is important to scale up opioid agonist therapy among people who inject drugs to improve their ART initiation."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The level of rubella susceptibility among women of reproductive age in Namibia is unknown. Documenting the risk of rubella will help estimate the potential burden of disease in Namibian women and the risk of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in infants, and will guide strategies for the introduction of rubella vaccine.
Methods
A total of 2044 serum samples from pregnant Namibian women aged 15–44 years were tested for rubella immunoglobulin G antibody; the samples were obtained during the 2010 National HIV Sentinel Survey. The proportion of women seropositive for rubella was determined by 5-year age strata, and factors associated with seropositivity were analyzed by logistic regression, including age, gravidity, HIV status, facility type, and urban/rural status.
Results
Overall rubella seroprevalence was 85% (95% confidence interval (CI) 83–86%). Seroprevalence varied by age group (83–90%) and health district (71–100%). In the multivariable model, women from urban residences had higher odds of seropositivity as compared to women from rural residences (odds ratio 1.40, 95% CI 1.09–1.81).
Conclusions
In the absence of a routine rubella immunization program, the high level of rubella seropositivity suggests rubella virus transmission in Namibia, yet 15% of pregnant Namibian women remain susceptible to rubella. The introduction of rubella vaccine will help reduce the risk of rubella in pregnant women and CRS in infants."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
To describe trends in major communicable diseases in Syria during the ongoing conflict, and the challenges to communicable disease surveillance and control in the context of dynamic, large-scale population displacement, unplanned mass gatherings, and disruption to critical infrastructure.
Methods
A rapid review of the peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed literature from 2005 to 2015 was performed, augmented by secondary analysis of monitoring data from two disease early warning systems currently operational in Syria, focusing mainly on three diseases: tuberculosis (TB), measles, and polio.
Results
Trend data show discrepancies in case report numbers between government and non-government controlled areas, especially for TB, but interpretation is hampered by uncertainties over sentinel surveillance coverage and base population numbers. Communicable disease control has been undermined by a combination of governance fragmentation, direct and indirect damage to facilities and systems, and health worker flight.
Conclusions
Five years into the crisis, some progress has been made in disease surveillance, but governance and coordination problems, variable immunization coverage, and the dynamic and indiscriminate nature of the conflict continue to pose a serious threat to population health in Syria and surrounding countries. The risk of major cross-border communicable disease outbreaks is high, and challenges for health in a post-conflict Syria are formidable."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Giardiasis is one of the most common intestinal infections in the world. There have been no national studies on the morbidity of giardiasis in Colombia. In this study, incidence rates of giardiasis were estimated for the years 2009–2013.
Methods
An observational, retrospective study of the giardiasis incidence in Colombia, 2009–2013, was performed using data extracted from the personal health records system (Registro Individual de Prestación de Servicios, RIPS). Official population estimates from the National Department of Statistics (DANE) were used for the estimation of crude and adjusted incidence rates (cases/100 000 population).
Results
During the period studied, 15 851 cases were reported (median 3233/year; 5-year cumulated crude national rate of 33.97 cases/100 000 population). Of these, 50.3% were female; 58.4% were <10 years old and 14.8% were 10–19 years old. By region, 17.7% were from Bogotá (10.07 cases/100 000 population, 2009), 10.9% from Antioquia (9.42, 2009), 8.6% from Atlántico (15.67, 2009), and 6.5% from Risaralda (33.38, 2009). Cases were reported in all departments (even insular areas).
Conclusions
As giardiasis is neglected in many countries, surveillance is not regularly undertaken. Despite its limitations, this study is the first attempt to provide estimates of national giardiasis incidence with consistent findings regarding affected age groups and geographical distribution."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Viral infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The effect of herpesvirus infections in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-seropositive (IgG-positive/IgM-negative) HSCT recipients remains poorly understood. The risk factors associated with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), HCMV, and human herpes virus type 6 (HHV-6) infections after HSCT, both alone and in combination, were investigated in this study.
Methods
Peripheral blood specimens were collected from 44 HSCT recipients and examined for viral DNA using quantitative fluorescence PCR assays. Risk factors for EBV, HCMV, and HHV-6 infections were analyzed by binary logistic regression, and relationships between these viruses were analyzed using the Chi-square test.
Results
EBV, HCMV, and HHV-6 were detected in 50%, 45.45%, and 25% of HCMV-seropositive (IgG-positive/IgM-negative) HSCT recipients, respectively. Male sex (p=0.007) and conditioning regimens including anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) (p=0.034) were strongly associated with an increased risk of EBV infection. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with corticosteroids was a risk factor for both EBV (p=0.013) and HCMV (p=0.040) infections, while EBV infection (p=0.029) was found to be an independent risk factor for HHV-6 infection. Pre-existing HHV-6 infection was associated with lower rates of HCMV infection (p=0.002); similarly, pre-existing HCMV infection was protective against HHV-6 infection (p=0.036).
Conclusions
HCMV-seropositive (IgG-positive/IgM-negative) HSCT recipients exhibited a high rate of herpesvirus infections, particularly EBV. ATG and male sex were strongly associated with an increased risk of EBV infection. GVHD prophylaxis with prednisone was found to affect both EBV and HCMV infections. Prior infection with EBV was shown to promote HHV-6 infection. Taken together, these data highlight the need for active monitoring of herpesvirus infections in patients undergoing HSCT."

Infectious diseases remain a major public health problem worldwide. Hence, their surveillance is critical. Currently, many surveillance strategies and systems are in use around the world. An inventory of the data, surveillance strategies, and surveillance systems developed worldwide for the surveillance of infectious diseases is presented herein, with emphasis on the role of the microbiology laboratory in surveillance.
Methods
The data, strategies, and systems used around the world for the surveillance of infectious diseases and pathogens, along with current issues and trends, were reviewed.
Results
Twelve major classes of data were identified on the basis of their timing relative to infection, resources available, and type of surveillance. Two primary strategies were compared: disease-specific surveillance and syndromic surveillance. Finally, 262 systems implemented worldwide for the surveillance of infections were registered and briefly described, with a focus on those based on microbiological data from laboratories.
Conclusions
There is currently a wealth of available data on infections, which has been growing with the recent emergence of new technologies. Concurrently with the expansion of computer resources and networks, these data will allow the optimization of real-time detection and notification of infections."

abstract = "Summary
The diagnosis of dog-mediated rabies in humans and animals has greatly benefited from technical advances in the laboratory setting. Approaches to diagnosis now include the detection of rabies virus (RABV), RABV RNA, or RABV antigens. These assays are important tools in the current efforts aimed at the global elimination of dog-mediated rabies. The assays available for use in laboratories are reviewed herein, as well as their strengths and weaknesses, which vary with the types of sample analyzed. Depending on the setting, however, the public health objectives and use of RABV diagnosis in the field will also vary. In non-endemic settings, the detection of all introduced or emergent animal or human cases justifies exhaustive testing. In dog RABV-endemic settings, such as rural areas of developing countries where most cases occur, the availability of or access to testing may be severely constrained. Thus, these issues are also discussed along with a proposed strategy to prioritize testing while access to rabies testing in the resource-poor, highly endemic setting is improved. As the epidemiological situation of rabies in a country evolves, the strategy should shift from that of an endemic setting to one more suitable for a decreased rabies incidence following the implementation of efficient control measures and when nearing the target of dog-mediated rabies elimination."

The analysis focused on the 23S rRNA gene, the rplD and rplV ribosomal genes, the ermB gene, and the regulatory region of the CmeABC efflux pump.
Results
The rates of resistance of C. jejuni to ciprofloxacin (CIP), nalidixic acid (NAL), doxycycline (DOX), tetracycline (TET), florfenicol (FFC), and chloramphenicol (CHL) increased significantly over the period studied (all p<0.05). Similarly, the proportions of resistant patterns (CIP–NAL–DOX–TET, CIP–NAL–DOX–TET–FFC, and CIP–NAL–DOX–TET–CHL) increased remarkably. In this study, 4.4% (9/203) of C. jejuni strains were ERY non-susceptible. The A2075G mutation in the 23S rRNA was found in all of the resistant strains except cj8091, which harbored the ermB gene. Interestingly, the ermB gene was also detected in intermediately resistant isolates, and the earliest ermB-positive strain cj94473 was derived in 1994. Moreover, none of the ribosomal rplD or rplV genes harbored mutations that have been described to confer resistance to macrolides. Different mutations affecting the regulatory region of the CmeABC efflux pump were also found.
Conclusions
This is the first comprehensive study on the recent trend in antimicrobial resistance and the molecular mechanisms of macrolide resistance in clinical C. jejuni strains isolated in China. More stringent monitoring and regulation of human and animal antimicrobial use are warranted."

Objectives
The aim of this study was to exploit the extensive database on strains of Yersinia collected over more than 50 years in France in order to gain an overview of yersiniosis and potential sources of contamination in this country.
Methods
The 19 670 strains of Yersinia of human, animal, environmental, and food origin isolated in France were grouped by species, biotype, and serotype.
Results
Most human strains (59%) were pathogenic, with a marked predominance of Yersinia enterocolitica bioserotype 4/O:3 (66.8%), followed by Y. enterocolitica 2/O:9 (23.8%) and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (6.1%). Pigs and pork meat were the nearly exclusive sources of Y. enterocolitica 4/O:3. Other pathogenic strains were rarely isolated from food or environmental samples (0.2%). The major source of pathogenic Yersinia was the animal reservoir, with a remarkable association between Y. enterocolitica 4/O:3 and pigs, Y. pseudotuberculosis and wildlife, Y. enterocolitica 2/O:9 and grazing farm animals, Y. enterocolitica 5/O:2,3 and hares, and Y. enterocolitica 3/O:1,2,3 and chinchillas.
Conclusions
The frequency of human infection caused by certain Yersinia subgroups might be related to the frequency of exposure to specific animal sources. In contrast, non-pathogenic Yersinia were commonly isolated from foodstuffs and the environment, most probably accounting for the abundance of non-pathogenic Yersinia recovered from human stools."

Background
Tuberculosis remains a public health problem in France and the diagnosis of tuberculosis disease (TB) is sometimes difficult. The aim of this study was to analyse the contribution of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube assay (QFT-GIT) to TB diagnosis.
Methods
Sixty patients hospitalized with TB, for whom a QFT-GIT assay had been performed between June 2008 and June 2011 at the University Hospital of Bondy in the north-east of Paris, were identified retrospectively. Clinical and laboratory data were collected. The sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios of the QFT-GIT were all calculated. Furthermore, the characteristics of patients testing positive were compared to those of patients testing negative, as well as the QFT-GIT values according to several different factors.
Results
The sensitivity of the QFT-GIT was 85% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73–0.92) and specificity was 73.3% (95% CI 0.68–0.78). The positive predictive value was 39.5% and the negative predictive value was 97.3%. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 3.2 and 0.20, respectively. The prevalence of TB in this population was 15% (pre-test probability). After a positive test result, the probability of TB increased to 40% (post-positive probability test); after a negative test result, it decreased to 4.5% (post-negative probability test). The combination of the QFT-GIT test with the tuberculin skin test brought no significant improvement in sensitivity. Factors significantly associated with a negative QFT-GIT result included older age, high C-reactive protein, a low lymphocyte count, and immunosuppressant intake. The test value in quantitative terms was significantly higher in those with lymph node TB than in those with pulmonary TB, and in younger patients (<40 years) than in older patients (>40 years old).
Conclusion
On its own, QFT-GIT is an insufficient tool to confirm the diagnosis of TB disease. However, it may form part of an ensemble of tools in combination with clinical, biological, and radiological assessments."

abstract = "Summary
Introduction
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major public health problem, especially in resource-limited settings where many patients are diagnosed at the stage of complications. In Cameroon, where HCV is endemic, little is known about the clinical, biological, and virological profile of HCV-infected patients.
Methods
A clinical case note review of all patients positive for antibodies against HCV diagnosed at the gastroenterology outpatient clinic of the Douala General Hospital, Cameroon, from January 2008 to December 2014, was performed.
Results
A total of 524 patients were included in the study, 53% of whom were female. The mean age was 56±13 years. A history of blood transfusion and a history of scarification were the most common potential risk factors for HCV exposure, as found in 16% and 13% of the study population, respectively. Current alcohol use was found in 24% of patients. Co-infection with hepatitis B virus and HIV was 3.6% and 3.4%, respectively. Among the patients, 39% had no complaint at diagnosis; only 16% were diagnosed through a routine medical checkup. Clinically, the most common finding was hepatomegaly (26.1% of patients). Transaminases above the upper limit of normal were found in 55.2% of patients, particularly those aged >57 years (p=0.001). Genotypes 1 (43.95%), 2 (25.11%), and 4 (28.25%) were the most common. Liver cirrhosis was present in 11% of patients and hepatocellular carcinoma in 4%, the latter being more common in males (p<0.001) and in those aged >57 years (p=0.03).
Conclusions
In the gastroenterology clinic of Douala General Hospital, while almost 40% of patients who were anti-HCV antibody-positive were asymptomatic and diagnosed fortuitously, some already presented complications, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. There is an urgent need to put in place programs to increase awareness and diagnosis of HCV infection and to develop extensive and targeted anti-HCV treatment guidelines to improve the management of these patients in Cameroon."

In this study, we studied the N and H genes from wild type measles viruses (MeVs) isolated during the 2013-2014 outbreak.
Methods
Clinical samples were collected, and the genotyping, phylogenetic analysis were performed.
Results
The vaccination rate of the study population was 4%. Genotype H1a was the predominant genotype. Wild type viruses were classified into clusters A and B, C and may have different origins. N-450 sequences from wild type viruses were highly homologous with, and likely evolved from MeVs circulating in Tianjing and Henan in 2012. MVs/Shenyang.CHN/18.14/3 could have evolved from MeVs from Liaoning, Beijing, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Henan, Jilin, and Tianjin. Our data suggested that one or more of the same viruses circulated between Beijing, Shenyang, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Berlin.
Conclusions
Important factors contributing to outbreaks could include weak vaccination coverage, poor vaccination strategies, and migration of adult workers between cities, countries, and from rural areas to urban areas."

Objectives
In Niger, 65% of hepatocarcinoma and 75% of cirrhosis cases were due to hepatitis B virus (HBV). We studied the genotypic characteristics of HBsAg in chronically HBV-infected patients in Niamey.
Methods
We studied prospectively HBV genotypic patterns among hospitalized patients with HBV infection in the National Hospital of Niamey, Niger. Patients were screened for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV genotyping was performed on the HBsAg-positive patients.
Results
In this study, we have confirmed the predominance of the HBV genotype E (HBV-E) in Niger and have identified 2 recombinant forms including HBV-E/D and HBV-A3/E reported previously among blood donors in Niger and Ghana, respectively. Amino acid substitutions found in HBV sequences obtained here included P120T, S143L, G145A and A194T. These substitutions were characterized as being associated with modified antigenicity and, notably, with impaired serological detection of HBsAg, while the A194T variant was found to have a controversial role in reduced susceptibility to tenofovir.
Conclusions
We have identified two recombinant HBV forms and rare genotypic patterns in Niger that may affect hepatitis B surface antigen antigenicity, and improve current knowledge of epidemiological, clinical and virological patterns of hepatitis B in this country."

Antimicrobial resistance is closely linked to antimicrobial use and is a growing concern worldwide. Antimicrobial resistance increases healthcare costs substantially in many countries, including Lebanon. National data from Lebanon have, in the most part, been limited to a few academic hospitals. The Lebanese Society of Infectious Diseases conducted a retrospective study to better describe the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacterial isolates in Lebanon. Data were based on records retrieved from the bacteriology laboratories of 16 different Lebanese hospitals between January 2011 and December 2013. The susceptibility results of a total 20684 Gram-positive and 55594 Gram-negative bacteria were analyzed. The prevalence rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was 27.6% and of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp was 1%. Streptococcus pneumoniae had susceptibilities of 46% to oxacillin, 63% to erythromycin, and 98% to levofloxacin. Streptococcus pyogenes had susceptibilities of 94% to erythromycin and 95% to clindamycin. The mean ampicillin susceptibility of Haemophilus influenzae, Salmonella spp, and Shigella spp isolates was 79%, 81.3%, and 62.2%, respectively. The extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production rate for Escherichia coli was 32.3% and for Klebsiella spp was 29.2%. Acinetobacter spp showed high resistance to most antimicrobials, with low resistance to colistin (17.1%). Pseudomonas spp susceptibilities to piperacillin–tazobactam and imipenem were lower than 80% (79.7% and 72.8%, respectively). This study provides population-specific data that are valuable in guiding antimicrobial use in Lebanon and neighbouring countries and will help in the establishment of a surveillance system for antimicrobial resistance following the implementation of a nationwide standardization of laboratory methods and data entry."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is recognized as the most pathogenic and infectious among the hepatotropic viruses. Studies on the treatment of HDV have predominantly included European patients and carriers of genotype 1 (HDV-1) in their clinical protocols. For the Amazon region, data show that infected individuals have mainly Native American ancestry and that >90% of HDV carriers have the genotype 3 (HDV-3). Thus combined therapy clinical protocols do not adequately address the treatment of these patients.
Methods
A prospective, non-randomized study was conducted in which 22 patients received 180μg of pegylated interferon alpha 2a (PEG-IFN) plus entecavir at a dose of 0.5mg for 48 weeks, with a subsequent 24-week follow-up. Throughout treatment, the patients were monitored for biochemical responses and the kinetics of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HDV viral loads.
Results
Of the 22 patients treated, 15 presented normal alanine aminotransferase values at the end of treatment (p=0.002). At week 24 of treatment, 86.4% of the patients did not present detectable HDV-RNA; at week 48, the rate of negative patients increased to >95% and remained the same after 6 months. With regard to HBV, only two patients (9%) still presented detectable HBV genetic material at the end of treatment, suggesting the effectiveness of combined therapy in combating the two viruses.
Conclusions
These findings support the use of this effective therapeutic protocol for HDV-3 in patients of non-European ethnicity and suggest a possible ‘easy to treat’ variant when compared to HDV-1."

Background
The lack of Treponema pallidum-specific antigens with highly accurate diagnosis makes the diagnosis of syphilis challenging.
Methods
A soluble recombinant version of a new diagnostic protein Tp0663 has been produced. The serodiagnostic potential of this protein was assessed by screening 3326 serum samples simultaneously evaluated by rapid plasma reagin and T. pallidum particle agglutination tests. Kappa (κ) coefficients were used to compare the concordance between clinical diagnosis and the Tp0663-based ELISA or the ARCHITECT Syphilis TP chemiluminescent immunoassay (Abbott GmbH and Co. KG).
Results
Using the results of clinical diagnosis as the gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of Tp0663 were found to be 98.83% (95% confidence interval (CI) 96.61–99.60%) and 100% (95% CI 99.88–100%), respectively. In comparison, the ARCHITECT Syphilis TP assay was found to have a lower sensitivity (97.27%, 95% CI 94.46–98.67%) and specificity (99.61%, 95% CI 99.32–99.78%). In particular, the ARCHITECT Syphilis TP exhibited a false-positive rate of 0.39%. Moreover, the ELISA was in perfect agreement with the gold standard, with a κ value of 0.99, comparable to that of ARCHITECT Syphilis TP (0.96).
Conclusion
These results identified Tp0663 as a novel serodiagnostic candidate with great potential for developing novel tests for the diagnosis of syphilis."

The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of serotypes and the antimicrobial susceptibilities of Streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates causing invasive and non-invasive disease in children aged ≤60 days in hospitals in Mexico.
Methods
A 15-year retrospective study was conducted for the period 2000 to 2014. Pneumococcal clinical isolates were serotyped by Quellung reaction, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed with the broth microdilution method.
Results
A total of 126 pneumococcal isolates were collected. Pneumonia was the most frequent diagnosis (40.5%), followed by meningitis (29.4%), septicemia (16.7%), and other clinical entities, including otitis media and conjunctivitis (13.5%). The most frequent serotypes before the introduction of heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) were 19F, 23F, 7F, and 35B. Serotypes 3, 6A, 10A, 12F, and 15A/B increased after the introduction of PCV7. Serotype 19A was isolated most frequently in the pneumonia and meningitis cases only after the introduction of PCV7, and it displayed a high resistance to penicillin.
Conclusions
Although the number of infections in infants aged ≤60 days was low, such infections were not unusual events. New vaccination strategies should be evaluated to limit the risks in this age group."

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is probably the leading cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma globally. Diagnostic tools conventionally used for the detection and identification of HCV infection are technically demanding, time-consuming, and costly for resource-limited environments. This study reports the development of the first rapid loop-mediated reverse transcription isothermal amplification assay that rapidly detects and identifies HCV genotypes in blood components.
Methods
RNA extracted from donor plasma and serum specimens was applied to a one-step reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification reaction performed with HCV-specific oligonucleotides. Reactions were conducted at 63.5°C for 30–60min. The diagnostic characteristics of the assay were investigated and validated with clinical specimens.
Results
Electrophoretic analysis of amplification revealed detection and identification of HCV genotypes 1–6. Positive amplification revealed unique ladder-like banding patterns that identified each HCV genotype. The assay demonstrated a sensitivity of 91.5% and specificity of 100%. Rapid naked-eye detection of HCV infection was facilitated by observation of an intense fluorescent glow of amplified targets under UV illumination.
Conclusion
These diagnostic characteristics highlight the potential utility of this assay for the rapid detection and genotype identification of HCV infection in field and point-of-care settings in endemic regions and resource-limited environments."

Background
A Chinese medical team managed Ebola virus disease (EVD) patients in Sierra Leone from October 2014 to March 2015 and attended to 693 suspected patients, of whom 288 had confirmed disease.
Methods
A retrospective study was conducted of the 288 patients with confirmed disease. Clinical symptoms, manifestations, and serum viral load were analyzed and compared among the different groups for mortality and survival time.
Results
Among the 288 confirmed EVD patients (149 male and 139 female, median age 28 years, and median log viral load 6.68), 98 died, 36 recovered, and 154 were lost to follow-up. Common symptoms were fever (77.78%), fatigue (64.93%), abdominal pain (64.58%), headache (62.85%), and diarrhea (61.81%). Compared to patients aged<18 years, those who were older than 40 years had a higher probability of death (odds ratio 2.855, p=0.044). Patients with a viral load of >106 copies/ml had a higher case fatality rate than those with <106 copies/ml (odds ratio 3.095, p=0.004). Cox regression showed that age, viral load, and the presence of diarrhea correlated with mortality.
Conclusion
Patients with a high viral load, of older age, and with diarrhea had a higher mortality and shorter survival time."

Objective
Negative conversion of sputum culture is a useful marker for predicting treatment outcome and relapse of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). The effect of drug resistance on negative conversion of sputum culture with treatment was evaluated in this study.
Methods
A total of 535 patients with culture-proven pulmonary TB were classified into three groups: drug-susceptible (DS), other drug-resistant (ODR), and multidrug-resistant/extensively drug-resistant (MDR/XDR). Rates of conversion of sputum culture at 4, 8, and 12 weeks were compared.
Results
At 4 weeks of treatment, the conversion rate in the DS group (52.7%) was higher than that in the ODR group (30.8%, p=0.003), but was not different compared with the MDR group (45.7%, p=0.427). At 8 weeks, the conversion rate in the DS group (76.3%) was higher than that in the ODR (63.5%, p=0.042) and MDR groups (60.0%, p=0.031). At 12 weeks, the conversion rate in the DS group (85.9%) tended to be higher than that in the MDR group (74.3%, p=0.062), but was not different from that in the ODR group (84.6%, p=0.796).
Conclusion
The pattern of resistance to anti-TB drugs affects culture conversion rates in the early phase of treatment and also prolongs the time to culture conversion."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Leprosy is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae that affects the skin and nerves. Although curable with multidrug therapy, leprosy is complicated by acute inflammatory episodes called reactions, which are the major causes of irreversible neuropathy in leprosy that occur before, during, and even after treatment. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment of reactions reduces the risk of permanent disability.
Methods
This exploratory study investigated whether urinary metabolic profiles could be identified that correlate with early signs of reversal reactions (RR). A prospective cohort of leprosy patients with and without reactions and endemic controls was recruited in Nepal. Urine-derived metabolic profiles were measured longitudinally. Thus, a conventional area of biomarker identification for leprosy was extended to non-invasive urine testing.
Results
It was found that the urinary metabolome could be used to discriminate endemic controls from untreated patients with mycobacterial disease. Moreover, metabolic signatures in the urine of patients developing RR were clearly different before RR onset compared to those at RR diagnosis.
Conclusions
This study indicates that urinary metabolic profiles are promising host biomarkers for the detection of intra-individual changes during acute inflammation in leprosy and could contribute to early treatment and prevention of tissue damage."

Background
Dengue is a notifiable infectious disease in many countries, but under-reporting of cases to National Epidemiological Surveillance Systems (NESSs) conceals the true extent of the disease burden. The incidence of dengue identified in a cohort study was compared with those reported to NESSs.
Methods
A randomized, placebo-controlled study was undertaken in Brazil, Colombia, Honduras, Mexico, and Puerto Rico to assess the efficacy of a tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) in children aged 9–16 years. The incidence of dengue in the placebo group was compared with that reported to NESSs in a similar age group (10–19 years) from June 2011 to April 2014.
Results
Three thousand six hundred and fifteen suspected dengue cases were identified in the study over 13527 person-years of observation. The overall incidence of confirmed dengue was 2.9 per 100 person-years (range 1.5 to 4.1 per 100 person-years). In the NESSs combined, over 3.2 million suspected dengue cases were reported during the same period, corresponding to over 1 billion person-years of observation. The incidence of confirmed dengue reported by the NESSs in the same locality where the study took place was 0.286 per 100 person-years across Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico (range 0.180 to 0.734 per 100 person-years). The incidence of confirmed dengue was 10.0-fold higher in the study than that reported to NESSs in the same localities (range 3.5- to 19.4-fold higher).
Conclusions
There is a substantial under-reporting of dengue in the NESSs. Understanding the level of under-reporting would allow more accurate estimates of the dengue burden in Latin America."

However, this strategy is failing primarily because the drugs are not getting to the people who need them the most. The current global coverage is 20%, the drug compliance rate is less than 50%, and the drug efficacy is approximately 50%. Thus in reality, only about 5% of the reservoir human population is actually receiving intermittent chemotherapy. Despite claims that more of the drug will soon be made available the current strategy is inherently flawed and will not lead to disease elimination. We discuss the many practical issues related to this global strategy, and advocate for an integrated control strategy targeting the life cycle and the most at-risk. Moreover, we discuss how an integrated control package for schistosomiasis should fit within a larger integrated health package for rural and remote villages in the developing world. A holistic health system approach is required to achieve sustainable control and ultimately disease elimination."

Japanese encephalitis (JE) is one of the most severe kinds of viral encephalitis and is prevalent in Asia and the Western Pacific. In China, JE was first reported in the 1940s and became the main cause of viral encephalitis, including in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. In 1951, JE was included in the Chinese mandatory disease reporting system. In the pre-vaccine era of the 1960s and 1970s, the incidence of JE continued to rise without any vaccine supply. Since JE vaccines became available in the late 1970s (MBD) and 1989 (LAV-SA-14-14-2), and as JE vaccine became freely available to patients beginning in 2008, the incidence of JE has declined significantly. Despite these gains, outbreaks continue to occur among children in rural and suburban areas. Strengthening vaccine delivery models and improving swine vaccine production are important in order to sustain continuous declines in the incidence of JE in Guangxi."

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is one of the most devastating fungal diseases in patients with impaired immunity. Effective antiviral therapies have reduced the burden of PCP among AIDS patients, but an increase in the prevalence of this disease among persons receiving immunosuppressive therapies has been reported.
Methods
We retrospectively reviewed HIV and non-HIV PCP patients diagnosed in our department during a nine year period. Data were collected from the local database completed during the diagnosis procedure. For each patient, demographic, clinical, radiological, biological and therapeutic data were analyzed.
Results
A total of 21,274 bronchoalveolar samples were received from patients suspected of pneumocystosis during the study period, leading to a discharge diagnosis of PCP for 604 patients (143 HIV-positive and 461 HIV-negative). The ratio of non-HIV versus HIV patients presenting PCP increased from 1.7 to 5.6 during the study period. The mortality rate at day 14 was 16%, occurring mostly in non-HIV patients (20.6% compared to 1.4%, P<0.0001), while non-HIV patients were less symptomatic at diagnosis than AIDS patients.
Conclusions
This study presents one of the higher number of HIV and non-HIV patients presenting with PCP in a single center. Pneumocystosis is now a crucial health challenge for patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, with a high mortality rate. This study highlights the need for international guidelines for prophylaxis of PCP in non-HIV patients."

Objectives
Rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) have emerged as important pathogens in clinical settings, associated with esthetic procedures and postsurgical infections, pulmonary infections among cystic fibrosis patients, and other structural pulmonary diseases. Microorganisms belonging to Mycobacterium abscessus–Mycobacterium chelonae and to Mycobacterium fortuitum groups have frequently been associated with outbreaks and various epidemics. In the present study, RGM strains were characterized in order to investigate molecular markers based on proteomic analysis.
Methods
Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) was used for species identification and clonal analysis of RGM recovered from postsurgical wound infections during an epidemic. The study included 30M. abscessus subsp. bolletii clinical isolates, most belonging to the BRA100 clone (epidemic in Rio de Janeiro city), as well as 16 RGM ATCC reference strains.
Results
Molecular typing allowed the detection of diversity in the studied population and revealed species-specific isoenzymatic patterns. Additionally, the clonal relationship among M. abscessus subsp. bolletii outbreak isolates, as examined using MLEE, was markedly consistent.
Conclusions
Isoenzymatic characterization was found to be a useful molecular tool to identify RGM species and to determine the relatedness among closely related M. abscessus subsp. bolletii isolates. This may be considered a powerful approach for epidemiological studies on RGM."

To give an overview of the HIV epidemic in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.
Methods
Articles on the MENA region were reviewed.
Results
The MENA region comprises a geographically defined group of countries including both high-income, well-developed nations and low- and middle-income countries. While the annual number of new HIV infections in Sub-Saharan Africa has declined by 33% since 2005, new HIV infections in the MENA region have increased by 31% since 2001, which is the highest increase among all regions in the world. Moreover, the number of AIDS-related deaths in 2013 was estimated to be 15000, representing a 66% increase since 2005. However, the current prevalence of 0.1% is still among the lowest rates globally. There is substantial heterogeneity in HIV epidemic dynamics across MENA, and different risk contexts are present throughout the region. Despite unfavorable conditions, many countries in the region have put significant effort into scaling up their response to this growing epidemic, while in others the response to HIV is proving slower due to denial, stigma, and reluctance to address sensitive issues.
Conclusions
The HIV epidemic in the MENA region is still at a controllable level, and this opportunity should not be missed."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Enterobacteriaceae can cause severe infections with high morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Individuals can be fecal carriers of these resistant organisms. Data on the extent of MDR Enterobacteriaceae fecal carriage in the community setting in Lebanon are very scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate the fecal carriage of MDR Enterobacteriaceae among the elderly residents of two nursing homes located in north Lebanon.
Methods
Over a period of 4 months, five fecal swab samples were collected from each of 68 elderly persons at regular intervals of 3–4 weeks. Fecal swabs were subcultured on selective media for the screening of resistant organisms. The phenotypic detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), AmpC, metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL), and Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) production was performed using the beta-lactamase inhibitors ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, phenylboronic acid, and cloxacillin. A temocillin disk was used for OXA-48. Multiplex PCRs were used for the genotypic detection of ESBL and carbapenemase genes, and sequencing was performed to identify CTX-M-15. The medical records of each subject were reviewed on a regular basis in order to assess the risk factors associated with MDR Enterobacteriaceae fecal carriage.
Results
Over the study period, 76.5% of the recruited elderly persons were at least one-time carriers. A total of 178 isolates were obtained. Phenotypic testing revealed that 91.5% of them were ESBL producers, 4% were AmpC producers, 2.8% were co-producers of ESBL and AmpC, and 1.7% were co-producers of OXA-48 and ESBL. Recent antibiotic intake was found to be the only independent risk factor associated with the fecal carriage of MDR Enterobacteriaceae.
Conclusions
The high prevalence of MDR Enterobacteriaceae detected in this study and the emergence of carbapenem resistance is alarming. Efficient infection control measures and antibiotic stewardship programs are urgently needed in these settings in order to limit the spread of resistant strains."

Enhanced surveillance systems have been implemented recently in many countries in order to rapidly detect and investigate any possible cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection among travellers returning from the Middle East, including notably Hajj pilgrims. According to the available surveillance data, only a few sporadic travel-associated MERS-CoV cases have been reported outside the Arabian Peninsula so far, mainly in Europe, North Africa, and Asia. These have resulted in no cases, or limited numbers of secondary cases except in Korea. The vast majority of viral respiratory infections in pilgrims returning home have been due to seasonal influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, and other known coronaviruses distinct from the MERS coronavirus. Influenza vaccination should be a priority for all Hajj pilgrims, as recommended by experts."

abstract = "Summary
Background
A novel avian influenza A H7N9 virus that infects humans was identified in China in 2013. This study is the first to comprehensively investigate the characteristics of genomic recombination, rather than reassortment, which has been the subject of investigation in previously reported studies.
Methods
Novel avian influenza virus (AIV) H7N9 genome sequences were obtained from the NCBI Influenza Virus Sequence Database and the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Database (GISAID) and a representative isolate was subjected to homogeneity analysis. A phylogenetic tree was constructed. Eight segments of the isolate were analyzed to identify segments with recombination events, the corresponding recombination fragments, and breakpoints. The evolutionary history of the recombined fragments was tracked by constructing phylogenetic trees of the recombination fragments.
Results
Among the eight segments of the novel AIV H7N9 analyzed, only the PB1 segment showed a marked recombination phenomenon, with 11 recombination events; these included five actual recombination events and six possible misalignment artifact recombination events. The most notable was the recombination of a 291-nucleotide (nt) fragment at the 490–780 nt site that was affiliated to a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 (A/tree sparrow/Thailand/VSMU-16-RBR/2005). The phylogenetic tree of the 291-nt recombination fragment on the PB1 segment showed that the novel AIV H7N9 had a close genetic relationship to H9N2 and H5N1.
Conclusions
The novel AIV H7N9 might have reassorted its PB1 segment from H9N2 circulating in China, and this H9N2 PB1 might have been recombined into a highly pathogenic fragment from HPAIV H5N1, which could be the reason for the high fatality rate among patients with AIV H7N9 influenza."

abstract = "Summary
Objective
The aims of this study were to perform a systematic review and synthesize epidemiological data on hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the Arabian Gulf countries, and to assess the country-specific prevalence among nationals and expatriate populations.
Methods
A systematic review of HCV antibody prevalence and incidence in the Arabian Gulf countries was conducted, based on the items outlined in the PRISMA statement. Meta-analyses were performed incorporating inverse variance weighting and using a random-effects model to pool summary estimates of HCV prevalence among general population groups, for nationals and the entire resident population.
Results
A total of 557 prevalence measures and one incidence measure were identified for the Arabian Gulf countries. HCV prevalence among nationals was 0.24% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02–0.63) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), 0.44% (95% CI 0.29–0.62) in Kuwait, 0.51% (95% CI 0.43–0.59) in Qatar, and 1.65% (95% CI 1.40–1.91) in Saudi Arabia. No data were available for Bahrain or Oman. Among the entire resident populations, HCV prevalence was 0.30% (95% CI 0.23–0.38) in Bahrain, 0.41% (95% CI 0.35–0.46) in Oman, 1.06% (95% CI 0.51–1.81) in Qatar, 1.45% (95% CI 0.75–2.34) in Kuwait, 1.63% (95% CI 1.42–1.84) in Saudi Arabia, and 1.64% (95% CI 0.96–2.49) in UAE. A higher prevalence was observed among expatriate populations such as Egyptians. Among the high-risk populations, HCV prevalence was as high as 78.6% in the multi-transfused and 74.6% in people who inject drugs.
Conclusions
National-level HCV prevalence in the Arabian Gulf region is comparable to global levels. A higher prevalence is found in specific expatriate populations, reflecting the prevalence in their countries of origin. Most exposures appear to occur in high-risk groups and these are often linked to medical care."

Objectives
China has repeatedly used supplemental immunization activities (SIAs) to work towards measles elimination, but it is unknown if the SIAs are reaching non-locals – migrants from rural to urban areas. This study characterized temporal trends in measles incidence by local and non-local residency and evaluated the impact of SIAs on measles incidence in Tianjin, China.
Methods
Daily measles case-counts were tabulated separately by residency. These two datasets were combined so that each day had two observations. Poisson regression was conducted using generalized estimating equations with an exchangeable working correlation structure to estimate rate ratios (RRs).
Results
There were 12465 measles cases in Tianjin over the 10-year period. The rate of measles was higher in non-locals than locals before the 2008 SIA (RR 3.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.27–3.96), but this attenuated to a RR of 1.22 between the 2008 and 2010 SIAs (95% CI 1.02–1.45). Following the 2010 SIA, non-locals had a lower rate of measles (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69–0.87).
Conclusions
The disparity in measles incidence between locals and non-locals was reduced following two SIAs. Sustained public health interventions will be needed to maintain low measles incidence among non-locals given the ongoing migration of people throughout China."

Objectives
Despite the availability of vaccines, children are the people most often affected by epidemic meningococcal meningitis. The pattern of the epidemic meningococcal meningitis outbreak in Northern Nigeria in 2009 and the Neisseria meningitidis strains responsible for this epidemic are described here.
Methods
A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in 16 states, involving 48 local government areas (LGAs), 91 health facilities, and 96 communities. Data collection involved in-depth interviews with key informants from the federal to the community level, a review of records, and a solution-oriented national workshop with participants from all states of the Federation. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected from some of the suspected cases at the start of the outbreak and were tested using the rapid Pastorex latex agglutination kit.
Results
Kastina (11153, 20.4%), Jigawa (8643, 15.8%), Bauchi (8463, 15.5%), Kano (6811, 12.4%), and Gombe (6110, 11.2%) were the states with the highest prevalence of meningitis. The states of Nasarawa (11.0%), Adamawa (8.0%), and Borno (7.6%) recorded the highest percentage of deaths, while the Shongom (Gombe State 12.5%), Illela (Sokoto State 9.8%), and Ikara (Kaduna State 9.1%) LGAs recorded the most deaths amongst cases seen.
Conclusions
The testing of CSF samples during meningitis outbreaks is recommended in order to monitor the occurrence of the multiple meningitis serotypes during these outbreaks and to direct serotype-specific vaccination response activities."

Objectives
Multifactorial interventions are crucial to arrest the threat posed by infectious diseases. Public involvement requires adequate information, but determinants such as health literacy can impact on the effective use of such knowledge. The influence of health literacy on infectious diseases is examined in this paper.
Methods
Databases were searched from January 1999 through July 2015 seeking studies reporting on health literacy and infections such tuberculosis, malaria, and influenza, and infection-related behaviours such as vaccination and hand hygiene. HIV was excluded, as comprehensive reviews have already been published.
Results
Studies were found on antibiotic knowledge and use, the adoption of influenza and MMR immunizations, and screening for sexually transmitted and viral hepatitis infections. There was a lack of investigations on areas such as tuberculosis, malaria, hand hygiene, and diarrhoeal diseases.
Conclusions
Limited or insufficient health literacy was associated with reduced adoption of protective behaviours such as immunization, and an inadequate understanding of antibiotics, although the relationship was not consistent. Large gaps remain in relation to infectious diseases with a high clinical and societal impact, such as tuberculosis and malaria."

To help address this gap, a 5-day intensive bioinformatics workshop was offered in Lima, Peru. The syllabus is presented here for others who want to develop similar programs. To assess knowledge gained, a 20-point knowledge questionnaire was administered to participants (21 participants) before and after the workshop, covering topics on sequence quality control, alignment/formatting, database retrieval, models of evolution, sequence statistics, tree building, and results interpretation. Evolution/tree-building methods represented the lowest scoring domain at baseline and after the workshop. There was a considerable median gain in total knowledge scores (increase of 30%, p<0.001) with gains as high as 55%. A 5-day workshop model was effective in improving the pathogen-applied bioinformatics knowledge of scientists working in a middle-income country setting."

Objectives
CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T-cells (Treg) are known to accumulate under certain pathological conditions. This study was conducted to evaluate the characteristics of and dynamic changes in Treg cells in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients during antiviral therapy.
Methods
One hundred and forty-five subjects were enrolled in this study, including 105 CHC patients and 40 healthy donors. The phenotypes and functions of Treg cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.
Results
A significant elevation in Treg cells was observed in the peripheral blood of CHC patients compared with healthy donors. Interestingly, compared with non-suppressive Treg (non-Treg) and resting Treg (rTreg) cells, activated Treg (aTreg) cells expressed higher levels of ectonucleotidase, CD39, and CD73. After treatment with interferon alpha (IFN-α) and ribavirin (RBV) in vitro, the frequencies of total Treg cells and aTreg cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), as well as the levels of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) secreted by aTreg and non-Treg cells, were significantly decreased. Importantly, it was found that levels of aTreg cells in patients with a sustained virological response (SVR) were lower than in relapsed patients, suggesting that a high frequency of aTreg cells might be associated with a poor clinical outcome in HCV infection.
Conclusion
These results demonstrate a decreasing trend in aTreg cells, which express higher levels of CD39, CD73, and TGF-β, in SVR patients during antiviral therapy."

Methods
The antiviral potency of these drugs against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in mice was assessed. Importantly, the clinical effectiveness of oseltamivir and umifenovir was evaluated in a retrospective study conducted in 26 regions of Russia.
Results
All tested viruses (n=36) were susceptible to oseltamivir and umifenovir in vitro. Oseltamivir (10mg/kg/day) and umifenovir (60mg/kg/day) significantly increased the survival of mice challenged with A/California/04/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 virus (p<0.05). Influenza infection was laboratory-confirmed in 442 patients among 1462 patients hospitalized with acute respiratory infections. The treatment of influenza-infected patients within 48h of symptom onset with oseltamivir and umifenovir was associated with a significant decrease in the duration of illness (2–3 days) and symptoms (p<0.001). Pneumonia was observed in none of the patients treated with oseltamivir and in 0.3% of the patients treated with umifenovir, compared to 23.7% of patients who did not receive antiviral therapy (p<0.001).

Objectives
Different methods for the classification of leprosy have been proposed since the 1930s. The aim of this study was to compare the current methods at a referral center in Brazil.
Methods
The World Health Organization (WHO) operational classification was compared to the Ridley and Jopling classification, the Madrid classification, and a classification based on the number of body areas affected by skin and/or neural lesions (NBAA). The correlation between the clinical and histopathological components of the Ridley and Jopling classification was assessed.
Results
The agreement between the WHO operational classification and the Ridley and Jopling classification was 77.6% (kappa = 0.53). The WHO operational classification tended to overestimate the number of multibacillary patients. The WHO operational classification showed its best agreement with the NBAA. There was perfect agreement between the clinical and histopathological Ridley and Jopling classification in 46.9% of the patients.
Conclusions
The agreement between the WHO operational classification and the Ridley and Jopling classification was better than any other purely clinical classification, reinforcing the importance and simplicity of the operational method. Although major disagreement between the clinical and histopathological Ridley and Jopling classification was uncommon, perfect agreement occurred in less than half of the cases, and was even lower for the borderline lepromatous and tuberculoid forms. Possible reasons for the differences are discussed; these showed that there may be room for improvement in the Ridley and Jopling classification histopathological criteria."

The primary objective of this study was to compare laboratory practices for screening blood donors for syphilis at blood transfusion facilities in Ghana with the recommendations of the World Health Organization and the National Blood Service, Ghana (NBSG). The prevalence of syphilis antibodies in blood donors in Ghana was also estimated.
Methods
Over an 11-month period, from February 2014 to January 2015, a semi-structured questionnaire was administered to 122 laboratory technical heads out of a total of 149 transfusion facilities in Ghana. The response rate was 81.9%.
Results
A total of 58 (48%) transfusion facilities tested donors for syphilis, with an estimated 3.7% seroprevalence (95% confidence interval 3.6–3.8%). A total of 62782 out of 91386 (68.7%) donations were tested with assays that are not recommended. The estimated syphilis seroprevalence in voluntary donations was 2.9%, compared to 4.0% in family donations (p=0.001). Only 6.9% of the health facilities were using standard operating procedures (SOPs).
Conclusions
Despite international and national recommendations, more than half of the studied health facilities that provide blood transfusions in Ghana are not screening blood donations for syphilis. These data show a considerable mismatch between recommendations and practice, with serious consequences for blood safety and public health."

Background
The relationship between concurrent sexual partnerships and HIV risk is not fully understood. Evidence on the relationship between partner concurrency (one's sexual partner has another partner) and individual HIV risk is limited. In this study, the relationship between reported sexual partner concurrency and the risk of HIV infection was explored among South Africans.
Methods
Data from the third South African national HIV survey were used. In this survey, performed in 2008, questionnaires and HIV tests were administered to a nationally representative sample of 15031 persons. Bivariate analysis and multiple logistic regression were used to evaluate the relationship between partner concurrency and HIV serostatus. Spearman's correlation was used to test the association between the prevalence of HIV and partner concurrency by race in women.
Results
The relationship between HIV prevalence and partner concurrency varied by race. At a cross-racial level there was a positive association between HIV prevalence and partner concurrency for women (rho=0.95, p=0.05). Among coloured, white, and Indian persons, HIV prevalence and partner concurrency rates were too low to allow further statistical testing. In the bivariate analysis, black African women who reported partner concurrency had a higher prevalence of HIV (36% (95% confidence interval (CI) 29.7–42.0) vs. 23% (95% CI 19.6–26.1), p<0.001). After controlling for demographic, social, biological, and behavioural variables, the association remained statistically significant (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.4, p=0.04). The association was stronger among 15–29-year-old black African women (aOR 1.8, p=0.03) than among women aged 30 years and older (aOR 1.3, p=0.36).
Conclusions
These results suggest that partner concurrency may increase the HIV infection risk for black South African women, and in particular, for younger women."

Background
Clinical findings suggest that the use of rectal culture-guided antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the infection rate following transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TRUSBx).
Methods
A decision-analytic model was designed to compare the outcomes of TRUSBx performed with (rectal culture-guided group) and without (standard ciprofloxacin prophylaxis) rectal swab culture-guided antimicrobial prophylaxis in Hong Kong. The post-biopsy infection rate, infection-related costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost for infection, and incremental cost per QALY saved (ICER) were assessed. Model inputs were retrieved from local epidemiology data and the medical literature. A sensitivity analysis was performed to test the robustness of the model results.
Results
Base-case analysis showed that the infection rate in the culture-guided group was reduced from 2.42% to 0.23% and saved 0.0002 QALYs, with a lower cost (USD 31.4 versus USD 55.6) (USD 1=HKD 7.8). The number needed to screen to prevent an infection episode was 45.7. The hospital days avoided per 100 patients using culture-guided prophylaxis was 7.08 days. The relative effectiveness of culture-guided antimicrobial prophylaxis versus standard prophylaxis in carriers and non-carriers of FQ-resistant rectal flora were identified as potential influencing factors. In 10000 Monte Carlo simulations, ICERs of the culture-guided group were below the willingness-to-pay threshold 99.12% of the time.
Conclusions
Using rectal culture-guided antimicrobial prophylaxis for men undergoing TRUSBx appears to be a cost-saving strategy to avert post-biopsy infection and QALY loss in Hong Kong."

abstract = "Summary
Objective
For reasons that have yet to be elucidated, the uptake of preventive measures against infectious diseases by Hajj pilgrims is variable. The aim of this study was to identify the preventive advice and interventions received by Australian pilgrims before Hajj, and the barriers to and facilitators of their use during Hajj.
Methods
Two cross-sectional surveys of Australians pilgrims aged ≥18 years were undertaken, one before and one after the Hajj 2014.
Results
Of 356 pilgrims who completed the survey (response rate 94%), 80% had the influenza vaccine, 30% the pneumococcal vaccine, and 30% the pertussis vaccine. Concern about contracting disease at Hajj was the most cited reason for vaccination (73.4%), and not being aware of vaccine availability was the main reason for non-receipt (56%). Those who obtained pre-travel advice were twice as likely to be vaccinated as those who did not seek advice. Of 150 pilgrims surveyed upon return, 94% reported practicing hand hygiene during Hajj, citing ease of use (67%) and belief in its effectiveness (62.4%) as the main reasons for compliance; university education was a significant predictor of hand hygiene adherence. Fifty-three percent used facemasks, with breathing discomfort (76%) and a feeling of suffocation (40%) being the main obstacles to compliance.
Conclusion
This study indicates that there are significant opportunities to improve awareness among Australian Hajj pilgrims about the importance of using preventive health measures."

To report that dengue fever (DF) could have triggered Plasmodium ovale wallikeri malaria.
Methods
A retrospective case report of P. ovale malaria and DF in a single patient in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, who had lived in Angola, is presented.
Results
On the second week of illness, the patient was referred to our research service. As symptoms had persisted up to day 14, malaria was also considered, based on the patient's long-standing epidemiological history. On day 16 of illness, a thick blood smear was positive for P. ovale (3480 parasites/mm3), PCR for malaria was positive for P. ovale wallikeri, and the kinetics of dengue virus (DENV) antibodies suggested a recent primary dengue infection.
Conclusions
Concurrent infections of DENV and malaria have rarely been reported; the actual impact of these sequential or simultaneous infections remains unknown. Therefore, DF must be considered as a potential co-morbidity for malaria, because of its influence on fluid electrolyte management. The case presented showed consistent temporal, clinical, and laboratory evidence that the relapse or the long incubation period of P. ovale malaria may have been triggered by a recent DF episode. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report of DENV and P. ovale co-infection."

abstract = "Summary
The dominant approach to decision-making in public health policy for infectious diseases relies heavily on expert opinion, which often applies empirical evidence to policy questions in a manner that is neither systematic nor transparent. Although systematic reviews are frequently commissioned to inform specific components of policy (such as efficacy), the same process is rarely applied to the full decision-making process. Mathematical models provide a mechanism through which empirical evidence can be methodically and transparently integrated to address such questions. However, such models are often considered difficult to interpret. In addition, models provide estimates that need to be iteratively re-evaluated as new data or considerations arise. Using the case study of a novel diagnostic for tuberculosis, a framework for improved collaboration between public health decision-makers and mathematical modellers that could lead to more transparent and evidence-driven policy decisions for infectious diseases in the future is proposed. The framework proposes that policymakers should establish long-term collaborations with modellers to address key questions, and that modellers should strive to provide clear explanations of the uncertainty of model structure and outputs. Doing so will improve the applicability of models and clarify their limitations when used to inform real-world public health policy decisions."

Nodding syndrome is a devastating neurological disorder, mostly affecting children in eastern Africa. An estimated 10000 children are affected. Uganda, one of the most affected countries, set out to systematically investigate the disease and develop interventions for it. On December 21, 2015, the Ministry of Health held a meeting with community leaders from the affected areas to disseminate the results of the investigations made to date. This article summarizes the presentation and shares the story of studies into this peculiar disease. It also shares the results of preliminary studies on its pathogenesis and puts into perspective an upcoming treatment intervention. Clinical and electrophysiological studies have demonstrated nodding syndrome to be a complex epilepsy disorder. A definitive aetiological agent has not been established, but in agreement with other affected countries, a consistent epidemiological association has been demonstrated with infection by Onchocerca volvulus. Preliminary studies of its pathogenesis suggest that nodding syndrome may be a neuroinflammatory disorder, possibly induced by antibodies to O. volvulus cross-reacting with neuron proteins. Histological examination of post-mortem brains has shown some yet to be characterized polarizable material in the majority of specimens. Studies to confirm these observations and a clinical trial are planned for 2016."

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global emergency, with an estimated 9.6 million new TB cases worldwide reported in 2014. Twenty-eight percent of these cases were in the World Health Organization (WHO) Africa Region, where the annual case detection rate was 281 per 100000 population—more than double the global average of 133 per 100000. Of the 9.6 million people who developed TB, an estimated 1.2 million (12%) were HIV-positive, and the Africa Region accounted for 74% of these cases. Three million people with TB remain undiagnosed and untreated. Globally, an estimated 480000 had multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Whilst of the African countries, only South Africa has reported a high prevalence of MDR-TB, it is likely that all of Sub-Saharan Africa has an unreported high load of drug-resistant TB. Tragically, in 2014, only 48% of individuals diagnosed with MDR-TB had successful treatment and an estimated 190000 people died of MDR-TB. Of the global TB funding gap of US$ 0.8 billion, the largest funding gap was in the Africa Region, amounting to US$ 0.4 billion in 2015. The MDR-TB pandemic in particular now threatens to devastate entire regions and may fundamentally alter the life-expectancy and demographic profile of many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The theme designated for this year's World TB Day, March 24, 2016, is ‘Unite to End TB’. From the Africa Region, there is an urgent need to seriously address the political, economic, and social factors that influence host–Mycobacterium tuberculosis interactions and result in disease. Recent political and funder initiatives that provide renewed hope for the alleviation of Africa's TB and TB/HIV problems are discussed."

Objective
Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne infection with great impact on animal and human health. The objectives of this study were to identify ecological factors that explain the risk of RVF outbreaks in eastern and central Kenya and to produce a spatially explicit risk map.
Methods
The sensitivity of seven selected ecological variables to RVF occurrence was assessed by generalized linear modelling (GLM). Vegetation seasonality variables (from normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data) and ‘evapotranspiration’ (ET) (metrics) were obtained from 0.25–1km MODIS satellite data observations; ‘livestock density’ (N/km2), ‘elevation’ (m), and ‘soil ratio’ (fraction of all significant soil types within a certain county as a function of the total area of that county) were used as covariates.
Results
‘Livestock density’, ‘small vegetation integral’, and the second principal component of ET were the most significant determinants of RVF occurrence in Kenya (all p ≤ 0.01), with high RVF risk areas identified in the counties of Tana River, Garissa, Isiolo, and Lamu.
Conclusions
Wet soil fluxes measured with ET and vegetation seasonality variables could be used to map RVF risk zones on a sub-regional scale. Future outbreaks could be better managed if relevant RVF variables are integrated into early warning systems."

Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are emerging worldwide as significant causes of chronic pulmonary infection, posing a number of challenges for both clinicians and researchers. While a number of studies worldwide have described an increasing prevalence of NTM pulmonary disease over time, population-based data are relatively sparse and subject to ascertainment bias. Furthermore, the disease is geographically heterogeneous. While some species are commonly implicated worldwide (Mycobacterium avium complex, Mycobacterium abscessus), others (e.g., Mycobacterium malmoense, Mycobacterium xenopi) are regionally important. Thoracic computed tomography, microbiological testing with identification to the species level, and local epidemiology must all be taken into account to accurately diagnose NTM pulmonary disease. A diagnosis of NTM pulmonary disease does not necessarily imply that treatment is required; a patient-centered approach is essential. When treatment is required, multidrug therapy based on appropriate susceptibility testing for the species in question should be used. New diagnostic and therapeutic modalities are needed to optimize the management of these complicated infections."

Objectives
The role of a newly discovered bunyavirus, the severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), in the pathogenesis of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is poorly understood. In this study, it was hypothesized that peripheral monocytes, which are constantly exposed to viral infection in the blood, are likely targeted by the causative virus in SFTS patients.
Methods
Fifty-three patients and 25 healthy volunteers were enrolled in the study. Monocyte counts in the peripheral blood of all human subjects were monitored throughout the progress of the disease. SFTSV viral load and the expression of monocyte genes were investigated by real-time RT-PCR. Cytokine production of monocytes in SFTS patients upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation was examined by ELISA.
Results
In comparison to SFTS patients in the convalescent stage and healthy controls, monocyte cell counts and percentages in patients at the acute stage were significantly lower. Decreased monocyte cell counts and subsets were positively correlated with SFTSV viral loads in the serum samples from SFTS patients. Despite their higher basal toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression, monocytes from patients in the acute phase were shown to be compromised regarding the production of tumor necrosis factor alpha, but not interleukin 10, upon LPS stimulation.
Conclusions
These data strongly suggest that monocytes could be a major target during SFTSV infection. The decreased population and dysfunction of monocytes in acute SFTS patients may contribute to the disease severity."

Meningococcal disease is a serious public health threat, especially during mass gatherings such as Hajj and Umrah which provide optimal conditions for disease transmission. The disease is caused by Neisseria meningitidis and transmitted mainly via asymptomatic carriers. A review of the literature on asymptomatic N. meningitidis carriage among Hajj and Umrah pilgrims and their household contacts was performed. Carriage studies reported carriage rates to be higher in Hajj pilgrims compared to Umrah pilgrims and that these events promote acquisition of carriage among pilgrims. With some outliers, most studies found carriage rates among pilgrims to be comparable to those in populations under non-epidemic settings. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, taking into account the limitations within the studies identified. A wide variety of N. meningitidis serogroups appear to be circulating among Hajj and Umrah pilgrims, with serogroups W135 and B being most prominent. Current Hajj and Umrah meningococcal disease preventative measures do not necessarily prevent carriage and transmission, which may result in local and international outbreaks among susceptible populations. Monitoring carriage states of visitors and local inhabitants in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as well as the implementation of preventive measures that impact carriage, are warranted to reduce the risk of Hajj and Umrah-related meningococcal disease outbreaks."

In adults, oxacillin resistance increased from 16% to 23% (p<0.001) and constitutive clindamycin resistance increased notably from 5% to 29% (p<0.001). These findings demonstrate a dramatic increase in clindamycin resistance among S. aureus isolates and suggest against the usage of clindamycin as empirical treatment for suspected S. aureus infections in Israel.
Conclusions
Beta-lactam anti-staphylococcal agents may be given as empirical treatment for children, but should be considered according to risk factors for adults in Israel."

Mass gatherings pose distinctive challenges for medicine. One neglected aspect of this is that the behaviour of people participating in such events is different from the behaviour they exhibit in their everyday lives. This paper seeks to describe a social psychological perspective on the processes shaping people's behaviour at mass gatherings and to explore how these are relevant for an understanding of the processes impacting on the transmission of infection. It is inadequate to conceptualize mass gatherings as simply an aggregate of a large number of individuals. Rather, those present may conceptualize themselves in terms of a collective with a shared group identity. Thinking of oneself and others as members of a collective changes one's behaviour. First, one behaves in terms of one's understanding of the norms associated with the group. Second, the relationships between group members become more trusting and supportive. Understanding these two behavioural changes is key to understanding how and why mass gathering participants may behave in ways that make them more or less vulnerable to infection transmission. Implications for health education interventions are discussed."

Objectives
The aim of this study was to review the epidemiology of cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) reported in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from 2012 when the first MERS-CoV was confirmed up to July 2015.
Methods
MERS-CoV data were obtained from the Saudi Ministry of Health for the period 2012 to July 2015. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the results regarding the risk factors and mortality of MERS-CoV infection.
Results
In this series, the risk factors and outcomes of 939 cases of MERS-CoV occurring in the last 3 years are described. The majority of the affected patients were aged ≥40 years (n=657; 70%). Of the 657 patients aged ≥40 years, 377 (57.3%) died.
Conclusions
The case-fatality ratio was found to increase significantly with age. It ranged from 12.5% in those aged ≤19 years to 86.2% in those aged ≥80 years. The results confirmed the association between severe MERS-CoV illness and patients with a pre-existing health morbidity. The duration from symptom onset to admission was not statistically associated with the disease outcome."

Objectives
The diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) in children is challenging due to insufficient specimen material and the scarcity of bacilli in specimens. This study aimed to evaluate methods for diagnosing TB in children in Sudan.
Methods
Patients (N=197) were subjected to the tuberculin skin test (TST). Gastric lavage or sputum specimens were then collected, processed, and cultured as per standard procedures.
Results
Culture on Löwenstein–Jensen medium, the reference standard, revealed growth in 16.2% of the specimens. Comparative analysis showed that 43.7% were positive for the TST (sensitivity 100%, specificity 67.3%), 8.1% were positive by Ziehl–Neelsen stain (sensitivity 43.8%, specificity 98.8%), 11.2% by auramine stain (sensitivity 56.3%, specificity 98.8%), and 17.8% were positive for PCR amplification of the IS6110 sequence (sensitivity 100%, specificity 98.8%).
Conclusions
It is concluded that whilst TST and IS6110 achieved 100% sensitivity based on the reference standard of culture, the latter was more specific. The TST is recommended for routine diagnosis and the use of PCR for particular cases, depending on the facilities and the urgency."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
The platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) have been studied widely in cancer diseases. However, their correlation with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation of PLR and NLR with disease severity in patients with HCV-related liver disease and the virological response in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients.
Methods
The clinical data of 120 HCV-infected patients and 40 healthy controls were analyzed. The clinical data of 24 CHC patients who had been followed up regularly were collected for the following time points: before treatment (week 0) and weeks 4, 48, and 72 during treatment. These data were also analyzed. All data were collected from the database of the hospital patient electronic medical record system.
Results
The HCV-related cirrhosis group and HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma group were found to have lower PLRs (61±31 and 51±23) than the healthy controls (115±23). The PLR of the HCV cleared group (154±85) was significantly higher than that of the HCV untreated group and HCV uncleared group (90±28 and 88±40, respectively). Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis for the PLR showed an area under the curve of 0.772 (95% confidence interval 0.674–0.869, p<0.000); for NLR, the area under the curve was 0.612 (95% confidence interval 0.495–0.730, p=0.063). Furthermore, an increasing PLR in CHC patients indicated a good virological response, and a stable PLR or a downward trend in PLR could predict no rapid virological response being achieved by week 4, and even no sustained virological response by week 72.
Conclusions
The PLR is closely related to disease severity in patients with HCV-related liver disease and to the virological response in CHC patients. Dynamic continuous monitoring of the PLR will contribute to disease surveillance, with an increasing tendency predicting a good virological response."

Objectives
In the USA, tuberculosis disease rates are highest in older adults. Diagnostic testing for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) has not been evaluated carefully in this group. The aim of this study was to define the relationship between tuberculin skin test (TST) results, T-SPOT.TB results, and T-cell responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens.
Methods
Long-term care facility residents with known prior TST results (positive or negative) were retested with TSTs and T-SPOT.TB. Prior exposure to M. tuberculosis was assessed by quantifying T-cell activation to mycobacterial antigens in vitro.
Results
The median age of the 37 participants was 77 years (range 57–98 years). Among 18 participants with a prior positive TST, three (16.7%) had a negative TST when retested (TST reversion); two had a negative T-SPOT.TB. Of the 15 who were historically and currently TST-positive, four (26.7%) had a negative T-SPOT.TB and one (6.7%) had a borderline result. Percentages of CD4+ T-cells responding to mycobacterial antigens were higher in participants with positive TST and T-SPOT.TB (18.2%) compared to those with a positive TST but negative T-SPOT.TB (6.4%, p=0.16) and negative TST and T-SPOT.TB (5.9%, p<0.001).
Conclusions
LTBI testing in older adults is complicated by TST reversion and TST-positive/T-SPOT.TB-negative discordance, which may reflect clearance of infection or waning immunity."

Mass gatherings are characterized by the concentration of people temporally and spatially, and may lead to the emergence of infectious diseases due to enhanced transmission between attendees. This is well-demonstrated in the context of the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages in Saudi Arabia. The goal of this review was to present the available evidence on outbreaks associated with a variety of pathogens, or also the lack thereof, as assessed by thorough surveillance at any mass gatherings with the exception of those in Saudi Arabia. A systematic search for relevant articles in the literature was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Sixty-eight studies were identified. Although outbreaks have not been reported frequently in or after mass gatherings outside the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages, they have sometimes occurred at Muslim, Christian, and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals. In this review it was found that the most common outbreaks at these mass gatherings involved vaccine preventable diseases, mainly measles and influenza, but also mumps and hepatitis A. Meningococcal disease has rarely been recorded. Additionally it was found that the transmission of various communicable diseases that may not be prevented by vaccination has been recorded in association with mass gatherings. These were mainly gastrointestinal infections, caused by a variety of pathogens. It was also noted that some outbreaks occurring at mass gatherings have resulted in the international spread of communicable diseases."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Clinical reasoning utilizing certain symptoms and scores has not proven to be a reliable decision-making tool to determine whether or not to suspect a group A Streptococcus (GAS) infection in the patient presenting with a sore throat. Culture as the so-called ‘gold standard’ is impracticable because it takes 1 to 2 days (and even longer in remote locations) for a result, and thus treatment decisions will be made without the result available. Rapid diagnostic antigen tests have demonstrated sufficient sensitivities and specificities in detecting GAS antigens to identify GAS throat infections.
Methods
Throat swab samples were collected from patients attending the Mount Isa Hospital emergency department for a sore throat; these samples were compared to swab samples collected from healthy controls who did not have a sore throat. Both groups were aged 3–15 years. All swab samples were analyzed with a point-of-care test (Alere Test Pack +Plus with OBC Strep A). The etiologic predictive value (EPV) of the throat swab was calculated.
Results
The 95% confidence interval for positive EPV was 88–100% and for negative EPV was 97–99%, depending on assumptions made.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates that the point-of-care test Alere Test Pack +Plus Strep A has a high positive predictive value and is able to rule in GAS infection as long as the proportion of carriers is low. Also the negative predictive value for ruling out GAS as the etiologic agent is very high irrespective of the carrier rate. Hence, this test is always useful to rule out GAS infection."

Mass gathering events pose critical health challenges, especially for the control of diseases. The rising population, better connectivity, and scope of travel have increased the frequency and magnitude of mass gatherings and underscore the need to shift the discourse from reacting to the public health issues they throw up to taking active steps in preventing them based on evidence through research. The Kumbh Mela is a religious event in India that constitutes the largest number of people gathered at a specific place and at a specific time. It is older than the Hajj by centuries, yet the public health aspects related to this event, which is held every 3 years, have not been fully studied. Understanding the Kumbh Mela can highlight the health challenges faced and provide crucial lessons for the management of mass gatherings. This investigation used the Kumbh Mela in the city of Allahabad as a case study to describe the health problems and the efforts taken to manage them. In-depth studies of the Kumbh Mela in the future are required to generate evidence for context-specific measures to address the complex health challenges of mass gatherings."

Objective
To evaluate non-inferiority of three doses of Quinvaxem in a compact prefilled auto-disabled (cPAD) injection system versus Quinvaxem in a single-dose vial administered with conventional syringe in terms of seroconversion/seroprotection rates for all antibodies (anti-hepatitis B (HB), anti-Haemophilus influenzae type b polyribosylribitol phosphate (Hib PRP), anti-diphtheria, anti-tetanus, anti-Bordetella pertussis) at 1 month after primary vaccination.
Methods
Four hundred healthy infants aged 42−65 days were randomized (1:1) to receive Quinvaxem in cPAD or single-dose vial at 6, 10, and 12 weeks of age. Blood samples were collected before vaccination and at 1 month after the third dose to determine seroconversion/seroprotection rates. Safety was assessed from solicited and unsolicited adverse events and serious adverse events (SAEs).
Results
Of the 400 infants randomized, 395 (98.8%) received all three vaccine doses. In the cPAD vs. single-dose vial groups, seroprotection rates against Hib PRP (both 98.5%), HB (92.9% vs. 93.4%), diphtheria (100% vs. 99%), and tetanus toxoids (both 100%), and seroconversion against B. pertussis (95.4% vs. 97%) were ≥92% at 1 month after the third vaccination (lower limits of 95% confidence intervals simultaneously greater than −10%). Geometric mean concentrations exceeded seroprotection/seroconversion thresholds by large margins. The incidences of induration and erythema were comparable between the groups; tenderness was slightly higher in the cPAD group (85.5% vs. 76.5%). No vaccine-related SAEs occurred.
Conclusions
Quinvaxem in cPAD was non-inferior to single-dose vial with respect to seroprotection/seroconversion rates for all antibodies. Both presentations were well-tolerated."

Tuberculosis (TB) is now the most common infectious cause of death worldwide. In 2014, an estimated 9.6 million people developed active TB. There were an estimated three million people with active TB including 360000 with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) who were not diagnosed, and such people continue to fuel TB transmission in the community. Accurate data on the actual burden of TB and the transmission risk associated with mass gatherings are scarce and unreliable due to the small numbers studied and methodological issues. Every year, an estimated 10 million pilgrims from 184 countries travel to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) to perform the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages. A large majority of pilgrims come from high TB burden and MDR-TB endemic areas and thus many may have undiagnosed active TB, sub-clinical TB, and latent TB infection. The Hajj pilgrimage provides unique opportunities for the KSA and the 184 countries from which pilgrims originate, to conduct high quality priority research studies on TB under the remit of the Global Centre for Mass Gatherings Medicine. Research opportunities are discussed, including those related to the definition of the TB burden, transmission risk, and the optimal surveillance, prevention, and control measures at the annual Hajj pilgrimage. The associated data are required to develop international recommendations and guidelines for TB management and control at mass gathering events."

Objectives
The aim of this study was to explore the pathogenic mechanism of group A Streptococcus (GAS) and to investigate how GAS evades phagocytosis by immune cells.
Methods
The classical inflammatory signaling pathway of macrophages infected with GAS was investigated by protein microarray, real-time PCR, Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and flow cytometry.
Results
GAS induced a lower level of inflammatory mediators in macrophages than either the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus or the Gram-negative Escherichia coli. Therefore, the conventional inflammatory signal pathway was investigated. It was found that GAS and S. aureus induced both toll-like receptor (TLR)2 and TLR4 expression, while Gram-negative E. coli only activated TLR4 in RAW264.7 cells. Although MyD88, the main adaptor protein, was activated by the three pathogens, there was no difference in MyD88 expression in macrophages. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) is the classical transcription factor of inflammatory signals, and the results of the present study showed that GAS, similar to E. coli, induced a weaker p65 nuclear translocation compared to S. aureus. Interestingly, GAS activated NF-κB by inducing p65–p52 heterodimer, but not the classical heterodimer of NF-κB (p65–p50), while E. coli activated NF-κB by inducing both p65–p50 and p65–p52 heterodimers.
Conclusions
Compared to S. aureus and E. coli infection, GAS induced a weaker nuclear translocation and distinct combination of NF-κB subunits in macrophages, which probably leads to a weak inflammatory response."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Buruli ulcer is the third most common mycobacterial infection worldwide. It is endemic in tropical, subtropical, and temperate climates. It causes devastating disease with morbidity and mortality. The treatment duration is long and the regimens considered are limited. Chronic cutaneous ulcers of mycobacterial etiology have been reported previously in Amman, but these were not associated with Mycobacterium ulcerans infection.
Methods
The case patient’s initial diagnosis was based on chronological and morphological features, combined with appropriate diagnostic tests. The skin features were assessed histopathologically. Skin testing was positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), and M. ulcerans was identified by DNA strip test (GenoType Mycobacterium CM/AS, Hain Lifescience), which is based on a PCR technique targeting a 23S rRNA gene region, followed by reverse hybridization and a line probe technology.
Results
The skin mycobacterial infection was evaluated and verified as having a Mycobacterium marinum–M. ulcerans pattern in the GenoType CM assay. It was then counted as a pattern representing individual species and was resolved with the GenoType AS assay as having an M. ulcerans pattern. M. ulcerans DNA was isolated and amplified by PCR, and then detected against reverse hybridization probes in the strip assay.
Conclusions
An indigenous case of M. ulcerans (Buruli ulcer) is reported for the first time from Jordan and the surrounding region."

abstract = "Summary
Objective
This study was conducted to compare the clinical and microbiological characteristics of first and breakthrough neutropenic fever in hematologic malignancy patients after chemotherapy.
Methods
Breakthrough neutropenic fever was any episode of fever, not present initially, that developed either during antibiotic therapy or within 1 week of discontinuation of therapy. A total of 687 neutropenic fever episodes in 241 patients were observed from April 2003 to March 2014.
Results
Blood cultures revealed 210 causative microorganisms: 199 (94.8%) were bacteria and 11 (5.2%) were fungi. Gram-negative bacteria predominated in both types of neutropenic episode (first 75% (120/160) vs. breakthrough 56% (18/32)) and the most common pathogen was Escherichia coli. Antibiotic resistance rates were higher in breakthrough episodes than first episodes (piperacillin/tazobactam 6% vs. 31%, p=0.006; ceftazidime 9% vs. 31%, p=0.025). Inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was also more frequent (0% vs. 19%, p=0.001), as was the 30-day mortality rate (4.3% (19/442) vs. 7.9% (19/245), p=0.058), although the latter effect was not statistically significant.
Conclusion
It is concluded that the epidemiological profile of breakthrough neutropenic fever is different from that of first episode fever. These data reinforce the view that pooled reporting of neutropenic fever may be misleading, and that clinicians should approach breakthrough fever as a distinct entity."

Mass gatherings at major international sporting events put millions of international travelers and local host-country residents at risk of acquiring infectious diseases, including locally endemic infectious diseases. The mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) has recently aroused global attention due to its rapid spread since its first detection in May 2015 in Brazil to 22 other countries and other territories in the Americas. The ZIKV outbreak in Brazil, has also been associated with a significant rise in the number of babies born with microcephaly and neurological disorders, and has been declared a ‘Global Emergency by the World Health Organization. This explosive spread of ZIKV in Brazil poses challenges for public health preparedness and surveillance for the Olympics and Paralympics which are due to be held in Rio De Janeiro in August, 2016. We review the epidemiology and clinical features of the current ZIKV outbreak in Brazil, highlight knowledge gaps, and review the public health implications of the current ZIKV outbreak in the Americas. We highlight the urgent need for a coordinated collaborative response for prevention and spread of infectious diseases with epidemic potential at mass gatherings events."

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has a long history of instituting preventative measures against meningococcal disease (MD). KSA is at risk of outbreaks of MD due to its geographic location, demography, and especially because it hosts the annual Hajj and Umrah mass gatherings. Preventative measures for Hajj and Umrah include vaccination, targeted chemoprophylaxis, health awareness and educational campaigns, as well as an active disease surveillance and response system. Preventative measures have been introduced and updated in accordance with changes in the epidemiology of MD and available preventative tools. The mandatory meningococcal vaccination policy for pilgrims has possibly been the major factor in preventing outbreaks during the pilgrimages. The policy of chemoprophylaxis for all pilgrims arriving from the African meningitis belt has also probably been important in reducing the carriage and transmission of Neisseria meningitidis in KSA and beyond. The preventative measures for Hajj and Umrah are likely to continue to focus on vaccination, but to favour the conjugate vaccine for its extra benefits over the polysaccharide vaccines. Additionally, the surveillance system will continue to be strengthened to ensure early detection and response to cases and outbreaks; ongoing disease awareness campaigns for pilgrims will continue, as will chemoprophylaxis for target groups. Local and worldwide surveillance of the disease and drug-resistant N. meningitidis are crucial in informing future recommendations for vaccination, chemoprophylaxis, and treatment. Preventative measures should be reviewed regularly and updated accordingly, and compliance with these measures should be monitored and enhanced to prevent MD during Hajj and Umrah, as well as local and international outbreaks."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Raoultella ornithinolytica is known to inhabit aquatic environments. The clinical features and outcomes of human infections caused by R. ornithinolytica have been reported for only a limited number of cases.
Methods
A retrospective study of cases of infection caused by R. ornithinolytica managed at four university hospital centres during the period before and after the introduction of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was performed. The aim was to describe the clinical and microbiological characteristics, treatments, and outcomes.
Results
Among 187 R. ornithinolytica isolates identified for which clinical information was available, 71 were considered colonizers and 116 were pathogenic. A total of 112 cases of R. ornithinolytica infection were identified. Urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal infections, wound and skin infections, and bacteraemia were observed in 36%, 14%, 13%, and 5% of cases, respectively. Associated infections that have been poorly reported, such as respiratory infections, i.e. pneumonia and pleural effusion, were observed in 24% of cases. Additional diseases reported here for the first time included osteomyelitis, meningitis, cerebral abscess, mediastinitis, pericarditis, conjunctivitis, and otitis. The proportion of R. ornithinolytica isolates resistant to antibiotics was found to be relatively high: 4% of isolates were resistant to ceftriaxone, 6% to quinolones, and 13% to co-trimoxazole. The mortality rate related to infection was 5%.
Conclusions
R. ornithinolytica is an underreported, emerging hospital-acquired infection and is particularly associated with invasive procedures. R. ornithinolytica should never be considered simply a saprophytic bacterium that occasionally contaminates bronchial lavage or other deep respiratory samples or surgical sites. Physicians should be aware of the high rates of antimicrobial resistance of R. ornithinolytica isolates so that immediate broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment can be established before accurate microbiological results are obtained."

Objectives
The avian influenza H7N9 virus can cause cytokine overproduction and result in severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Many studies have focused on hypercytokinemia during avian influenza infection. This study examined the association between C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokines.
Methods
The plasma cytokine and chemokine profiles of 57 H7N9 patients were investigated using a multiplex immunoassay. The CRP levels of patients with H7N9 and patients with H1N1 were also compared. Further, the association between cytokines and CRP in H7N9 infections was explored.
Results
Compared with H1N1 virus, it was found that H7N9 virus induced higher expression of CRP, leading to cytokine storms. Several cytokines, including MIP-1β, MCP-1, IP-10, and IL-6, were observed to have significantly positive relationships with CRP levels, whereas IL-17A was negatively associated with CRP levels.
Conclusions
These findings suggest that CRP may be used as an early indicator to identify high-risk patients, to assess disease progression, and to determine the development of hypercytokinemia."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
To assess off-treatment virological relapse rates and to determine the role of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) quantification in predicting virological relapse after stopping entecavir (ETV) treatment in patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB).
Methods
One hundred and twelve CHB patients for whom ETV was stopped in accordance with the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver guidelines stopping rules were enrolled. Patient HBsAg and HBV DNA levels were monitored every 4–12 weeks during ETV treatment and after ETV cessation. Post-treatment virological relapse was defined as a serum HBV DNA level of >10 000 copies/ml after stopping ETV treatment.
Results
The virological relapse rate at 52 weeks after stopping ETV was 48.2%. The post-treatment virological relapse rate was significantly higher in patients aged >50 years than in those aged <50 years (p < 0.001), and the virological relapse rate was significantly lower in patients with an HBsAg level <2.0 log10 IU /ml than in those with a level ≥2.0 log10 IU /ml at ETV cessation (p = 0.005). An HBsAg level of 2.5 log10 IU/ml at HBeAg seroconversion was the optimal cut-off value for predicting post-treatment virological relapse (p < 0.001). In those aged <50 years and with HBsAg ≤2.5 log10 IU/ml at HBeAg seroconversion, the relapse rate was only 5%. In patients with HBsAg ≤2.5 log10 IU/ml at HBeAg seroconversion, 52.4% achieved HBsAg levels ≤2.0 log10 IU/ml at ETV cessation, while in those with HBsAg >2.5 log10 IU/ml at HBeAg seroconversion, only 4.4% achieved this criterion.
Conclusions
HBsAg levels can help guide the timing of cessation of ETV treatment. HBsAg levels of 2.5 log10 IU/ml at HBeAg seroconversion may be a useful marker to predict virological relapse after the cessation of ETV treatment in HBeAg-positive CHB patients."

Objectives
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype has been described as an independent predictor of the response to therapy. A mixed infection with two types of HCV is probably an uncommon event. The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of mixed infection with two different HCV genotypes in adult patients with chronic hepatitis C eligible for treatment.
Methods
Plasma samples and clinical and demographic data were collected from 1159 patients with hepatitis C. The INNO-LiPA HCV assay was used to identify the HCV genotypes.
Results
The dominant genotype was genotype 1, which was found to be responsible for 83.9% of infections, with subtype 1b being the most common. A mixed genotype infection was detected in 26 patients (2.2%). The most common mixed genotype was 1a+1b detected in 17/26 patients (65%). Antiviral therapy led to complete elimination of both genotypes in 50% of patients with 1b+3a infection and in 33% of patients with 1b+4a infection.
Conclusions
The results obtained showed that infection with mixed HCV genotypes in Polish patients with hepatitis C is uncommon. The selective elimination of genotypes 3a and 4a after therapy confirms the greater resistance to treatment of genotype 1b. In the context of new anti-HCV drug development, further investigations are needed to determine the clinical importance of mixed HCV infection."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Bolivia is among the lowest-resourced South American countries, with very few data available on antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens. The phenotypic and molecular characterization of bacterial isolates responsible for urinary tract infections (UTIs) in the Bolivian Chaco are reported here.
Methods
All clinical isolates from UTIs collected in the Hospital Basico Villa Montes between June 2010 and January 2014 were analyzed (N=213). Characterization included susceptibility testing, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) detection, identification of relevant resistance determinants (e.g., CTX-M-type ESBLs, 16S rRNA methyltransferases, glutathione S-transferases), and genotyping of CTX-M producers.
Results
Very high resistance rates were observed. Overall, the lowest susceptibility was observed for trimethoprim–sulphamethoxazole, tetracycline, nalidixic acid, amoxicillin–clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin. Of E. coli and K. pneumoniae, 11.6% were ESBL producers. Resistance to nitrofurantoin, amikacin, and fosfomycin remained low, and susceptibility to carbapenems was fully preserved. CTX-M-15 was the dominant CTX-M variant. Four E. coli ST131 (two being H30-Rx) were identified. Of note, isolates harbouring rmtB and fosA3 were detected.
Conclusions
Bolivia is not an exception to the very high resistance burden affecting many South American countries. Optimization of alternative approaches to monitor local antibiotic resistance trends in resource-limited settings is strongly encouraged to support the implementation of effective empiric treatment guidelines."

abstract = "Summary
The appearance of novel pathogens of humans with epidemic potential and high mortality rates have threatened global health security for centuries. Over the past few decades new zoonotic infectious diseases of humans caused by pathogens arising from animal reservoirs have included West Nile virus, Yellow fever virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, Lassa Fever virus, Hanta virus, Dengue fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, and Zika virus. The recent Ebola Virus Disease epidemic in West Africa and the ongoing Zika Virus outbreak in South America highlight the urgent need for local, regional and international public health systems to be be more coordinated and better prepared. The One Health concept focuses on the relationship and interconnectedness between Humans, Animals and the Environment, and recognizes that the health and wellbeing of humans is intimately connected to the health of animals and their environment (and vice versa). Critical to the establishment of a One Health platform is the creation of a multidisciplinary team with a range of expertise including public health officers, physicians, veterinarians, animal husbandry specialists, agriculturalists, ecologists, vector biologists, viral phylogeneticists, and researchers to co-operate, collaborate to learn more about zoonotic spread between animals, humans and the environment and to monitor, respond to and prevent major outbreaks. We discuss the unique opportunities for Middle Eastern and African stakeholders to take leadership in building equitable and effective partnerships with all stakeholders involved in human and health systems to take forward a ‘One Health’ approach to control such zoonotic pathogens with epidemic potential."
