abstract = "Introduction
One of the serious consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is the shortage of protective equipment for health personnel. N95 masks are considered one of the essential protective equipment in the management of patients with COVID-19. The shortage of N95 masks implies potential health risks for health personnel and significant economic losses for the health institution. The objective of this work was to investigate the disinfection of N95 masks artificially contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 and ESKAPE bacteria by using hydrogen peroxide plasma.
Material and methods
We examined the disinfection capacity of hydrogen peroxide plasma against the SARS-CoV-2 and two members of the ESKAPE bacteria (Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus) through a study of artificial contamination in situ of N95 masks. Amplification of specific genes by RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 and microbiological culture of ESKAPE bacteria was performed before and after the disinfection process.
Results
SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in all assays using five different concentrations of the virus, and A. baumannii and S. aureus were not cultivable with inoculums of 102 to 106 CFU after disinfection tests of N95 masks with hydrogen peroxide plasma.
Conclusion
Disinfection of N95 masks by using the hydrogen peroxide plasma technology can be an alternative for their reuse in a shortage situation. Implications for the use of disinfection technologies of N95 masks and the safety of health personnel are discussed."

abstract = "Background
Contributions of contaminated wheelchairs to nosocomial pathogen transmission are relatively unknown. Our aim was to develop a model predicting pathogen exposures for patients utilizing wheelchairs and estimate exposure reduction potential of wheelchair disinfection between rides.
Methods
An agent-based model was informed by wheelchair location data from a connected 215-bed acute care and 250-bed long-term care facility. Simulated scenarios varied in frequencies of patient wheelchair contamination and wheelchair disinfection in between trips. Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) concentrations on patient hands at the end of wheelchair trips were estimated. Exposure reductions due to disinfection, assuming low real-world efficacies (50%, 70%, and 90%), were compared.
Results
In the simulation, when few patients introduced contamination to wheelchairs, disinfection in between patients 50% of the time decreased baseline (no disinfection) estimated exposures for the 50th wheelchair rider by >99.999%. When patients had a 50% chance of being contaminated before the wheelchair ride, disinfection did not reduce exposures consistently.
Discussion
The efficacy of disinfection in between patient rides as an exposure mitigation strategy likely depends on the frequency of infected patient wheelchair use.
Conclusions
During outbreak, high contamination conditions, disinfection, alone, is not enough to protect patients from wheelchair-mediated exposures."

: For older adults, over diagnosis of urinary tract infections (UTI) is a primary driver of inappropriate antibiotic use. This risk is increased for patients in long term care facilities (LTCF), especially as they transition back and forth to emergency departments (ED). In this study, we aimed to understand how healthcare provider communication and relationship dynamics affect LTCF residents treated in the ED to identify barriers to antibiotic stewardship for UTIs.
Methods
: We conducted semi-structured interviews with nurses and physicians from LTCFs and EDs, guided by the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety framework. Data were systematically coded and underwent iterative, conventional content analysis.
Results
: We interviewed 16 LTCF and 16 ED providers across Wisconsin. ED and LTCF nurses have a critical role in both intrafacility and interfacility communication. Fragmented communication and interprofessional power dynamics were identified barriers to optimal antibiotic prescribing for UTIs. Identified strategies to overcome these issues included using objective diagnostic criteria, development of communication scripts and nurse-to-nurse education.
Conclusions
: Our qualitative approach revealed important insights about how communication and relationship dynamics influence UTI diagnosis and optimal antibiotic stewardship for LTCF residents evaluated in the ED. Future interventions should strengthen communications between settings and across provider types, and address standardization of diagnostic and treatment communication pathways for LTCF residents with suspected infections transitioning between EDs and LTCFs."

The objective of this study was to identify sources and linkages among methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections using whole-genome sequencing (WGS).
Methods
A total of 56 samples were obtained from all patients with a confirmed MRSA infection over 6 months at University of Florida-Health Jacksonville. Samples were cultured and sequenced; data was analyzed on an automated cloud-based platform. Genetic Clusters were defined as <40 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Temporal Clusters were defined as ≥5 MRSA cases over 3 days.
Results
We found 7 Genetic Clusters comprising 15 samples. Four Genetic Clusters contained patients with non-overlapping stays (3-10 weeks apart), 3 of which contained patients who shared the same Unit. We also found 5 Temporal Clusters comprising 23 samples, although none of the samples were genetically related.
Discussion
Results showed that temporal clustering may be a poor indicator of genetic linkage. Shared epidemiological characteristics between patients in Genetic Clusters may point toward previously unidentified hospital sources. Repeated observation of related strains is also consistent with ongoing MRSA transmission within the surrounding high-risk community.
Conclusions
WGS is a valuable tool for hospital infection prevention and control."

To mitigate potential exposure of healthcare workers (HCWs) to SARS-CoV-2 via aerosol routes, we have developed a portable hood which not only creates a barrier between HCW and patient, but also utilizes negative pressure with filtration of aerosols by a high-efficiency particulate air filter.
Material and Methods
The hood has iris-port openings for access to the patient, and an opening large enough for a patient's head and upper torso. The top of the hood is a high-efficiency particulate air filter connected to a blower to apply negative pressure. We determined the aerosol penetration from outside to inside in laboratory experiments.
Results
The penetration of particles from within the hood to the breathing zones of HCWs outside the hood was near 10-4 (0.01%) in the 200-400 nm size range, and near 10−3 (0.1%) for smaller particles. Penetration values for particles in the 500 nm-5 μm range were below 10−2 (1%). Fluorometric analysis of deposited fluorescein particles on the personal protective equipment of an HCW revealed that negative pressure reduces particle deposition both outside and inside the hood.
Conclusions
We find that negative pressure hoods can be effective controls to mitigate aerosol exposure to HCWs, while simultaneously allowing access to patients."

Although contact precaution is generally recommended in situations where coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is suspected, there is limited evidence on environmental contamination of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Therefore, we conducted environmental surveillance on SARS-CoV-2 contamination in 2 different healthcare settings.
Methods
Viral contamination was investigated on the environment of 2 hospitals that had admitted 13 COVID-19 patients. In hospital A, 5 patients with pneumonia occupied negative pressure rooms. In hospital B, 8 asymptomatic patients shared 2 common 4-bed rooms. Most rooms were poorly cleaned or disinfected. Environmental swab were collected from inside and outside the rooms and were tested using real-time RT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.
Results
In hospital A, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 10 of 57 (17.5%) samples from inside the rooms including the Ambu bag and infusion pump. Two samples obtained at more than 2 m from the patients showed positive results. In hospital B, 3 of 22 (13.6%) samples from inside the rooms were positive. Areas outside the rooms, such as the anteroom, corridor, and nursing station, were all negative in both hospitals.
Conclusions
Hospital surfaces surrounding patients were contaminated by SARS-CoV-2. Our findings support the value of strict contact precaution, routine cleaning, and disinfection in the management of COVID-19 patients."

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by risk of nosocomial transmission; however, the extent of environmental contamination and its potential contribution of environmental contamination to SARS-CoV-2 transmission are poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate whether environmental contamination may play a role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Methods
Air samples were collected by natural precipitation, and environmental surface samples were collected by conventional surface swabbing. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was performed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.
Results
Viral RNA was not detected in the 44 air samples. The positive rates in 200 environmental surface samples in medical areas (24.83%) was higher than that in living quarters (3.64%), with a significant difference (P < .05). The positive rates were 25.00% and 37.50% for the general isolation ward and intensive care unit, respectively, and no significant difference was observed between them (P = .238). The top 5 sampling sites with a positive rate in medical areas were beepers (50.00%), water machine buttons (50.00%), elevator buttons (42.86%), computer mouses (40.00%), and telephones (40.00%).
Conclusions
Most of the touchable surfaces in the designated hospital for COVID-19 were heavily contaminated, suggesting that the environment is a potential medium of disease transmission. These results emphasize the need for strict environmental surface hygiene practices and enhanced hand hygiene to prevent the spread of the virus."

Since Vitamin D is known to be vital in regulating the immune system, and sunlight UV radiation exposure on the skin produces Vitamin D and UV intensity is highest nearest the equator, a study was done to examine the correlation between the latitude and COVID-19 fatality rates for countries.
Methods
Eighty-eight countries were selected based on their likelihood of providing reliable data. Using death rates/million for each country from the “worldometer” website, a correlation analysis was done between death rates and a country's latitude.
Results
A highly significant, positive correlation was found between lower death rates and a country's proximity to the equator (Pearson r = 0.40 P < .0001, 2-tailed t test). The R squared of 0.16 means that 16% of the variation in death rates among nations is accounted for by the latitude of the country. Evidence is presented suggesting a direct correlation between sunlight exposure and reduced mortality.
Discussion
This study is the first to document a statistically significant correlation between a country's latitude and its COVID-19 mortality and is consistent with other research regarding latitude, Vitamin D deficiency, and COVID-19 fatalities. Limitations of this study are noted.
Conclusions
Further research is needed to confirm the correlation between latitude and COVID-19 fatalities, and to determine the optimum amounts of safe sunlight exposure and/or vitamin D oral supplementation to reduce COVID-19 fatalities in populations that are at high risk for vitamin D deficiency."

South Korea's aggressive responses to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have greatly slowed the epidemic without regional lockdowns.
Methods
The Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's daily briefings were thoroughly reviewed. Information about hospital countermeasures and government coordination was collected via telephone interviews with 4 infection control team leaders, 1 emergency department nurse, and 1 infectious disease physician in Korea.
Results
After the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak, the government and hospitals prepared for the inevitable outbreak of emerging infectious diseases by reforming the epidemic preparedness system. As a result, COVID-19 diagnostic test kits were quickly developed, enabling extensive early detection of potential cases. Other key steps were tracking cases, finding exposed individuals, coordinating case assignments with health care facilities, and selective clinic screenings for visitors’ entering hospitals with mandatory mask wearing. Consequently, after overcoming the initial peak of the outbreak, which was related to a religious group, Korea has been able to maintain daily new cases at around 100 and to less than 50 daily cases in the second week of April.
Conclusions
To counter the COVID-19 pandemic, which may persist, long-term, sustained response strategies must be prepared along with coordination between government and health systems."

The emergence of the novel virus, SARS-CoV-2, has posed unprecedented challenges to public health around the world. Currently, strategies to deal with COVID-19 are purely supportive and preventative, aimed at reducing transmission. An effective and simple method for reducing transmission of infections in public or healthcare settings is hand hygiene. Unfortunately, little is known regarding the efficacy of hand sanitizers against SARS-CoV-2.
Methods
In this review, an extensive literature search was performed to succinctly summarize the primary active ingredients and mechanisms of action of hand sanitizers, compare the effectiveness and compliance of gel and foam sanitizers, and predict whether alcohol and non-alcohol hand sanitizers would be effective against SARS-CoV-2.
Results
Most alcohol-based hand sanitizers are effective at inactivating enveloped viruses, including coronaviruses. With what is currently known in the literature, one may not confidently suggest one mode of hand sanitizing delivery over the other. When hand washing with soap and water is unavailable, a sufficient volume of sanitizer is necessary to ensure complete hand coverage, and compliance is critical for appropriate hand hygiene.
Conclusions
By extrapolating effectiveness of hand sanitizers on viruses of similar structure to SARS-CoV-2, this virus should be effectively inactivated with current hand hygiene products, though future research should attempt to determine this directly."

Patient colonization has been suggested as a risk factor in hospital-associated infections (HAI) development, which are of the most frequent complications in hospitals.
Objective
To examine the colonization process and possible transmission routes of HAI-causative agents in step-down care unit (SDCU) patients.
Methods
Patients admitted to SDCU within 48 hours of admission that had no evidence of infection present, nurse health care workers (HCWs), and relatives of infected patients were included. Participants were sampled and cultured at different times in different body surfaces. Environmental surfaces and medical devices were also sampled. Antimicrobial susceptibility and clonal relatedness were determined in selected HAI-causative agents, environmental, nurse HCWs, and patient isolates.
Results
A total of 2,735 isolates corresponding to 126 species were identified. Of the 11 patients included, 8 developed 1-3 HAIs (14 isolates recovered as HAI-causative agents). Acinetobacter baumannii (36% of infections) was distributed in clone A (n = 1), B (n = 3), and F (n = 1); Klebsiella pneumoniae (29%) in clones A (n = 2) and B (n = 1) and Enterobacter cloacae (7%) in one clone A. Causative agents were progressively recovered from environmental surfaces and medical devices before and after HAI onset.
Conclusions
Highly related strains were recovered from environmental surfaces, patients, and nurse HCWs before and after HAI outcome. This is a first step to examine colonization process in SDCU settings and provides a base for further studies to understand colonization dynamics and the role of patients’ relatives and nurse HCWs in organism transmission in the SDCU."

Methods
We retrospectively collected data from the electronic medical record of patients in the Mayo Clinic Florida's COVID Virtual Clinic. Hundred and eighteen patients with detectable results for the virus were followed. Data reviewed in this study included (1) length of time from detectable to undetectable results; (2) length of time from onset of symptoms to undetectable result; (3) length of time from resolution of fever to undetectable result.
Results
Fifty-three percent of studied patients eligible for discontinuation of self-isolation had detectable viral RNA, and therefore, underwent repeat testing. In these patients, the mean from the date of their first detectable result to attaining an undetectable result was 14.89 days. The mean time for onset of symptoms to undetectable testing was 21.5 days.
Conclusions
Hundred and eighteen patients with detectable results for SARS-CoV-2 were followed in the Mayo Clinic Florida COVID Virtual Clinic; 53% of patients still showed detectable viral RNA despite meeting CDC guidelines for discontinuation of self-isolation, prompting us to propose following a more cautious guideline that other providers could consider as a strategy to discontinue self-isolation, including increasing length of days since symptom onset."

abstract = "Background
Despite a plethora of wipes available for use in health care facilities, there is a paucity of articles describing wipe composition, potential interactions between wipes and disinfectants, the manner in which wipes are used, and their relative efficacy. The purpose of this article is to provide an in-depth review of wipes used for disinfection of hard surfaces in health care settings.
Methods
Comprehensive searches of the Pubmed database and Internet were conducted, and articles published from 1953 through September 2019 and pertinent on-line documents were reviewed. Bibliographies of relevant articles were reviewed.
Results
Wipes vary considerably in their composition, and the disinfectants with which they are used. With reusable dry wipes, the ratio of wipe material to disinfectant and the amount of disinfectant absorbed by the wipe and delivered to surfaces is difficult to standardize, which may affect their efficacy. The manner in which wipes are used by health care personnel is highly variable, due in part to insufficient instructions for use and inadequate education of relevant personnel.
Conclusions
Additional research is needed regarding the best practices for using different types of wipes, improved methods for educating staff, and establishing the relative efficacy of wipes in reducing environmental contamination and health care-associated infections."

We aimed to investigate the relationship between clinical characteristics, outcomes and the severity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pneumonia.
Methods
We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes of confirmed COVID-19 cases and compared severe (ICU) and nonsevere (non-ICU) groups.
Results
We included 12 cohort studies including 2,445 patients with COVID-19. Compared with nonsevere (non-ICU) patients, severe (ICU) disease was associated with a smoking history (P = .003) and comorbidities including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 5.08, P < .001), diabetes (OR = 3.17, P < .001), hypertension (OR = 2.40, P < .001), coronary heart disease (OR = 2.66, P < .001), cerebrovascular diseases (OR = 2.68, P = .008), and malignancy (OR=2.21, P = .040). We found significant differences between the 2 groups for fever, dyspnea, decreased lymphocyte and platelet counts, and increased leukocyte count, C-creative protein, procalcitonin, lactose dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, creatinine kinase, and creatinine levels (P < .05). Significant differences were also observed for multiple treatments (P < .05). Patients in the severe (ICU) group were more likely to have complications and had a much higher mortality rate and lower discharge rate than those with nonsevere (non-ICU) disease (P < .05).
Conclusions
Investigation of clinical characteristics and outcomes of severe cases of COVID-19 will contribute to early prediction, accurate diagnosis, and treatment to improve the prognosis of patients with severe illness."

Limited studies have been published on practices and management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children. Despite the fact that COVID-19 rarely caused any severe disease in children, the asymptomatic children might be playing an important role for spreading COVID-19 in healthcare facilities. This review aimed at sharing our experience of how to handle patients with COVID-19 in a pediatric referral and tertiary care hospital to prevent the possible transmissions to the healthcare workers (HCWs).
Methods
This review sought to identify infection control practices measures during COVID-19 pandemic comes from our daily practice combined with the most recent guidelines with the new experience and information.
Results
Prevention the transmission of COVID-19 to the HCWs, 4 primary themes should be taken into consideration; (1) ongoing education and importance of the organization of the healthcare facility, (2) proper clinical triage and isolation of the suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients in the outpatient clinics and in the emergency departments, (3) necessity of the organization of the COVID-19 wards, and (4) utilization of personal protective equipment.
Conclusions
Infection control precautions to prevent the possible transmissions to HCWs as well as the other patients and their caregivers from children with COVID-19 are very critical. If sufficient precautions are not taken, healthcare settings may serve as additional source of transmission and spread of COVID-19 in the society."

Personal protective equipment (PPE) are stockpiled across the nation to offset supply depletion during public health emergencies. Stockpiled PPE inventories vary across the U.S. by type, model, quantity, and the conditions in which they are stored. Over the past decade, federal, state, and local stockpile managers have had concerns for the viability of aging PPE.
Methods
To understand factors that may affect stockpiled PPE, we explored the breadth of stockpile storage conditions and respirator and surgical gown inventories through collaboration with the national PPE community, qualitative observations collected at 10 different U.S. stockpiles, and by compiling stockpile PPE inventories and climate data from a convenience sample of U.S. stockpiles.
Results
The aggregated inventory from 20 stockpiles is reported, accounting for approximately 53 million respirators. Most respirators (69% or 35.8 million) have been stored between 5 and 10 years. Upon visiting 10 stockpile facilities, we report on the storage conditions observed and summarize the storage environment data collected.
Conclusions
This is the first study to identify common PPE types, inventories, and storage conditions across federal, state, and local government stockpile facilities as well as healthcare organization-managed caches. These findings will be leveraged to guide the development of sampling protocols for air-purifying respirators and surgical gowns in U.S. stockpiles to understand the performance viability after long-term storage."

Nosocomial infections are a leading cause of morbidity, costs, and mortality in preterm newborns. Most reports regarding nosocomial infections in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) are focused on bacterial infections and there is limited information regarding the impact of nosocomial viruses. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of nosocomial respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in a NICU.
Methods
This was a retrospective cohort design from a NICU in a general hospital in Mexico. We included 24 newborn infants with nosocomial RSV infection and 24 infants without RSV matched by gestational age, birth weight, and the period of time of hospitalization.
Results
Infants with nosocomial RSV infection had longer hospitalization duration (median 24 days vs. 13 days; P = .05), increased antibiotic use (45.8% vs. 8.3%; P = .003), more mechanical ventilation requirement (54.2% vs. 0.4%; P <.001), more frequent nosocomial infections (45.8% vs. 0%; P <.001), and higher hospitalization direct costs (median 3,587.20 USD vs. 1,123.60 USD; P = .001) after nosocomial RSV detection.
Conclusions
Nosocomial RSV infections are associated to a significant increase of costs in infants hospitalized in the NICU. Evaluation of interventions that may reduce the incidence of nosocomial RSV infections in this setting is warranted."

Healthcare associated infections are associated with indwelling devices. Yet, data regarding prevalence of indwelling devices in noncritically ill hospitalized patients remains scant.
Methods
Adult, noncritically ill patients on general care, telemetry, and surgical floors at our quaternary care hospital were surveyed on 2 separate days. Data regarding presence of indwelling vascular, urinary, and gastrointestinal devices, as well as nurse to patient ratio on each unit were collected.
Results
There were 1,229 devices observed among the 857 patients surveyed across 2 days. Of the surveyed patients, 780 (91.0%) had at least 1 indwelling device. Among all devices, intravenous catheters were the most common (90.1%), followed by gastrointestinal devices (12.8%) and urinary catheters (10.2%). The most prevalent device was peripheral intravenous catheters. The median nurse to patient ratio was 3 patients to 1 nurse; no difference in nurse to patient ratio based on the number of devices present was observed.
Conclusions
Indwelling device use appears highly prevalent in general care settings and variation among devices is common. Healthcare associated infections prevention strategies targeting these devices are necessary."

Qualitative interview study with frontline managers on 2 acute admission wards in a large National Health Service Trust in the United Kingdom.
Results
Managers reported that hand hygiene standards and audit were modeled on World Health Organization guidelines. Hand hygiene outside the immediate patient zone was not documented but managers could identify when additional indications for hand hygiene presented. They considered that audit was worthwhile to remind staff that hand hygiene is important but did not regard audit findings as a valid indicator of practice. Managers identified differences in the working patterns of nurses and doctors that affect the number and types of hand hygiene opportunities and barriers to hand hygiene. Ward managers were accepted as the custodians of hand-hygiene standards.
Conclusions
Frontline managers identified many of the issues currently emerging as important in contemporary infection prevention practice and research and could apply them locally. Their views should be represented when hand hygiene guidelines are reviewed and updated."

Ultraviolet (UV) disinfection decreases nosocomial disease rates in acute care settings; effective program implementation is poorly understood. We developed a program to UV-disinfect rooms following discharge of patients in transmission-based precautions (TBP) and assessed its effect on hospital-acquired infection (HAI) rates.
Methods
An isolation room housed a patient in any type of TBP. A priority room was an isolation room in TBP for multidrug resistant organisms or Clostridioides difficile infection. Percent rooms disinfected and HAI rates were calculated monthly. The two-robot program was started by Infection Prevention utilizing a single environmental services employee. Efficiency was increased by granting environmental services’ personnel oversight, increasing coverage, and modifying shift-based goals. Our primary goal was disinfection of all discharged priority rooms. Our secondary goal was disinfection of all discharged isolation rooms.
Results
The program achieved 6-month disinfection averages of 85.7% of isolation, and 87.7% priority rooms, respectively. Using a dedicated UV disinfection team and setting isolation room per shift goals improved coverage. HAI rates decreased by 16.2% following program implementation.
Conclusions
We implemented an effective UV disinfection program, and observed HAI reduction, by focusing on broad coverage and efficient deployment of assets without affecting patient flow or expanding the robot fleet."

Higher requirement is put forward in the measurement of hand hygiene (HH) during a pandemic. This study aimed to describe HH compliance measurement and explore observed influencing factors with respect to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) guidelines in China.
Methods
Compliance was measured as the percentage of compliant opportunities based on criteria for 17 moments. The criteria for compliance included HH behavior, procedure, duration, hand drying method, and the overall that counts them all. The observed influencing factors included different departments and areas and protection motivation. Descriptive analysis and logistic regression were performed.
Results
The compliance of overall criteria, HH behavior, procedure, duration, and hand drying method were 79.44%, 96.71%, 95.74%, 88.93%, and 88.42%, respectively, which were significantly different from each other (P < .001).

Environmental contamination of patient rooms and adjacent areas with C. difficile spores is a recognized transmission risk. Previous studies have shown that spores are aerosolized during patient care. These spores can remain airborne for extended periods and may contaminate distant surfaces. High-volume air sampling equipment allows for the collection of a large volume of air and was evaluated in the collection of C. difficile aerosol.
Method
Air samplers evaluated in this research included the DFU-1000, XMX/2L-MIL, Biocapture-650, and a MB2. Aerosols of C. difficile were generated in a 5-m3 chamber and each air sampler sampled in the aerosol test chamber simultaneously with referee air samplers.
Results
The DFU-1000 achieved the highest efficiency of the 4 air samplers (P = .0145) with a mean efficiency of 38.60%. The relative efficiencies of the Biocapture-650, XMX/2L-MIL, and MB2 were 28.16%, 10.51%, and 3.05%, respectively.
Discussion/Conclusions
This study demonstrated high variation based on the sampling method employed. Based on the results of these studies, high-volume air samplers may be effectively applied to sample for airborne C. difficile in health care environments. The high sampling flow rate of the DFU-1000 would allow for the complete sampling of a patient room-sized volume in less than 1 hour."

Methods
Administrative support with the aim of zero nosocomial transmission by reducing elective clinical services, decanting wards, mobilizing isolation facilities, providing adequate personal protective equipment, coordinating laboratory network for rapid molecular diagnosis under 4-tier active surveillance for hospitalized patients and outpatients, and organizing staff forum and training was implemented under the framework of preparedness plan in Hospital Authority. The trend of SARS-CoV-2 in the first 72 days was compared with that of SARS-CoV 2003.
Results
Up to day 72 of the epidemic, 130 (0.40%) of 32,443 patients being screened confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Compared with SARS outbreak in 2003, the SARS-CoV-2 case load constituted 8.9% (130 SARS-CoV-2/1458 SARS-CoV) of SARS-CoV infected cases at day 72 of the outbreak. The incidences of nosocomial acquisition of SARS-CoV per 1,000 SARS-patient-day and per 100 SARS-patient-admission were 7.9 and 16.9, respectively, which were significantly higher than the corresponding incidences of SARS-CoV-2 (zero infection, P <.001).

Although global and national AMR action plans are in place, infection prevention and control is primarily discussed in the context of health care facilities with home and everyday life settings barely addressed. As seen with the recent global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, everyday hygiene measures can play an important role in containing the threat from infectious microorganisms. This position paper has been developed following a meeting of global experts in London, 2019. It presents evidence that home and community settings are important for infection transmission and also the acquisition and spread of AMR. It also demonstrates that the targeted hygiene approach offers a framework for maximizing protection against colonization and infections, thereby reducing antibiotic prescribing and minimizing selection pressure for the development of antibiotic resistance. If combined with the provision of clean water and sanitation, targeted hygiene can reduce the circulation of resistant bacteria in homes and communities, regardless of a country's Human Development Index (overall social and economic development). Achieving a reduction of AMR strains in health care settings requires a mirrored reduction in the community. The authors call upon national and international policy makers, health agencies, and health care professionals to further recognize the importance of targeted hygiene in the home and everyday life settings for preventing and controlling infection, in a unified quest to tackle AMR."

abstract = "Objective
The past 4 months, the emergence and spread of novel 2019 SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19) has led to a global pandemic which is rapidly depleting supplies of personal protective equipment worldwide. There are currently over 1.6 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide which has resulted in more the 100,000 deaths. As these numbers grow daily, hospitals are being forced to reuse surgical masks in hopes of conserving their dwindling supply. Since COVID-19 will most likely have effects that last for many months, our nationwide shortage of masks poses a long term issue that must be addressed immediately.
Methods
Based on a previous study by Quan et al., a salt-based soaking strategy has been reported to enhance the filtration ability of surgical masks. We propose a similar soaking process which uses materials widely available in anyone's household. We tested this method of pretreating a variety of materials with a salt-based solution by a droplet test using fluorescently stained nanoparticles similar in size to the COVID-19 virus.
Results
In this study, we found that paper towels and surgical masks pretreated with the salt-based solution showed a noticeable increase in filtration of nanoparticles similar in size to the COVID-19 virus. We also show that the TWEEN20 used by Quan et al. is not a critical component for the solution, and using salt alone in solution still provides a dramatically increased level of protection.
Conclusions
We believe this method will allow for healthcare workers to create a disposable added layer of protection to their surgical masks, N95s, or homemade masks by using household available products. Adoption of this method may play an essential role in ensuring the safety of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and any pandemics that may arise in the future."

The World Health Organization recommends empowering patients/families to remind healthcare workers (HCWs) to perform hand hygiene (HH). We sought to understand acceptability of a family empowerment strategy in a Vietnamese pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).
Methods
With end-user input, we designed a tool to help families in a PICU in Vietnam to remind HCWs to perform HH. We conducted 3 preliminary focus group discussions (FGDs) with patients’ family members (n = 8), physicians (n = 9), and nurses (n = 8) to understand acceptability of preliminary tools, attitudes towards HH and barriers to HH. Tools were then modified and implemented in a 5-week intervention study. We then conducted 3 more FGDs with families (n = 7), physicians (n = 7), and nurses (n = 8). Discussions were analyzed using qualitative directed content analysis. Families who used the tool were asked to complete written surveys.
Findings
Both family members and HCWs felt that HCWs had a responsibility to perform HH. Barriers to performing HH were identified, including forgetfulness and time constraints. Family members felt shy reminding HCWs to perform HH. However, the HH reminder tool was acceptable, and some felt it could overcome barriers to reminding HCWs to perform HH. HCWs felt embarrassed when reminded to perform HH, but felt that the reminder was useful. Nearly all (99%) survey respondents felt that family members should speak up if they noticed HCWs omitting HH.
Conclusions
A tool given to families to remind HCWs to perform HH was largely acceptable in a pediatric ICU in Vietnam. Perceived benefits of improving HH were felt to surmount barriers to tool use."

Mobile phones are known to carry pathogenic bacteria and viruses on their surfaces, posing a risk to healthcare providers (HCPs) and hospital infection prevention efforts. We utilize an Ultraviolet-C (UV-C) device to provide an effective method for mobile phone disinfection and survey HCPs about infection risk.
Methods
Environmental swabs were used to culture HCPs’ personal mobile phone surfaces. Four cultures were obtained per phone: before and after the UV-C device's 30-second disinfecting cycle, at the beginning and end of a 12-hour shift. Surveys were administered to participants pre- and poststudy.
Results
Total bacterial colony forming units were reduced by 90.5% (P = .006) after one UV-C disinfection cycle, and by 99.9% (P = .004) after 2 cycles. Total pathogenic bacterial colony forming units were decreased by 98.2% (P = .038) after one and >99.99% (P = .037) after 2 disinfection cycles. All survey respondents were willing to use the UV-C device daily to weekly, finding it convenient and beneficial.
Discussion
This novel UV-C disinfecting device is effective in reducing pathogenic bacteria on mobile phones. HCPs would frequently use a phone disinfecting device to reduce infection risk.
Conclusions
In light of the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, a standardized approach to phone disinfection may be valuable in preventing healthcare-associated infections."

The growing understanding of the importance of a healthy microbiome is challenging traditional thinking that resulted in the general acceptance of the Germ Theory of Disease. We propose a more encompassing Microbial Theory of Health that will have implications for the way that we address our relationship with microbes, including hygiene policy and community-based infection control practices.
Methods
This paper considers theories over the last 30 years that have impacted hygiene policy and consumer practice, from the Germ Theory of Disease and the Hygiene Hypothesis, to the Microbial Theory of Health, including the concept of Bidirectional Hygiene. Here we present a high-level review of the literature on pathogen transmission and the cycle of infection in the home and everyday settings.
Results
Targeted hygiene is an evidence-based hygiene policy that is employed to prevent transmission of pathogens and the transmission of infectious diseases through targeting only sites, surfaces, and practices that are considered high risk for pathogen transmission. Targeted hygiene also discourages the indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum microbicides for lower-risk activities and surfaces.
Conclusions
The Microbial Theory of Health, including age-appropriate and health-appropriate hygiene practices for home and everyday life, should usher in a new era in which pathogen reduction can be accomplished without indiscriminate elimination of potentially beneficial microbes from the human and environmental microbiomes."

The N95 respirator is the most common safety tool used in hospitals to protect health care workers (HCW) from inhaling airborne particles. Focusing on HCW behavior related to respirator use is an effective route to improve HCW safety and respiratory health.
Methods
Participants were asked to perform the donning and doffing of an N95 respirator to camera. Then they were randomized to a video alone or a reflective practice intervention. After the intervention they repeated the donning and doffing to camera. A critical safety behavior scoring tool (CSBST) was developed to compare the performance of the participants over time at pretest, post-test and 1 month later for follow-up.
Results
The reflective practice intervention group was found to have significantly higher scores on the CSBST at post-test and follow-up than the video alone group. In the reflective practice intervention group, the participants perceived they were better at performing the N95 donning and doffing than the experts scored them.
Conclusions
The CSBST is a tool to measure the performance of HCWs on a specific targeted safety behaviors. The addition of a reflective practice intervention may result in a measurable and sustained improvement in the safety behaviors demonstrated when using the N95 respirator."

Background
Response to the COVID-19 pandemic by hospital systems has been strained by severe shortages in personal protective equipment (PPE), particularly N95 respirators. Recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention endorsed decontamination strategies to prolong the lifespan of single use respirators. Battelle and Duke University have validated hospital protocols to decontaminate respirators using vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) at 30%-35% concentrations. To prolong our supply of respirators, we evaluated and implemented VHP decontamination at 59% hydrogen peroxide concentration while detailing the effects of this process on the filtration efficiency and quantitative fit of single-use respirators. This study may help other health systems develop local solutions to their N95 mask shortage during this COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods
N95 respirators (3M 8211 FF and 9210 FF) that were treated with 5 and 10 cycles of VHP by the V-PRO® maX Low Temperature Sterilization System were evaluated quantitatively for filtration efficiency as well as with quantitative fit testing per Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards. A decontamination protocol was concurrently implemented at our institution. This process involved depositing used masks, reprocessing, and re-distributing treated masks efficiently back to frontline providers. Furthermore, we implemented patient safety officers (PSO) on COVID-19/person under investigation (PUI) units to ensure optimized donning/doffing of respirators through frontline provider education.
Results
There were no statistically significant changes in mean filtration efficiency between the control and VHP-treated respirators. Furthermore, both treated and untreated respirators demonstrated fit factors above the minimum pass requirement.
Conclusion
We have successfully demonstrated that N95 respirator decontamination with VHP at 59% hydrogen peroxide can be safely utilized to decontaminate single-use N95 respirators without significant effects on filtration efficiency or quantitative fit testing. With the COVID-19 pandemic and N95 respirator shortage, health systems without access to commercial decontamination processes should investigate the viability of such a process in their facilities."

Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is the most frequently occurring healthcare associated infection (HAI) among hospitalised patients. Adequate knowledge of CAUTI in healthcare workers supports effective prevention and control of the infection. This systematic review assesses instruments used to assess knowledge of CAUTI prevention in healthcare workers to inform future research. The catheter lifecycle model was used to evaluate the conceptual framework upon which the measurement instruments were based. Finally, the psychometric quality of these instruments was evaluated.
Methods
Five electronic databases were searched for published studies and instruments. The COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) checklist was used to assess the psychometric quality reporting of the instruments.
Results
Fifteen studies met the review inclusion criteria and 13 instruments were available for review. Most of the instruments did not address all knowledge components essential for CAUTI prevention as defined by the catheter lifecycle model. The psychometric quality of the instruments was not sufficiently evaluated.
Conclusions
Few instruments are available for CAUTI prevention knowledge measurement. The instruments were not closely aligned with the catheter lifecycle model as a framework. If CAUTI knowledge cannot be measured accurately using an effective instrument, this has the potential to impact negatively on clinical care and the focus of interventions. There is a need for a standardised instrument for the evaluation of CAUTI prevention knowledge so that targeted interventions can address knowledge deficits."

Privacy curtains within medical intensive care unit (MICU) rooms are a potential contributor to health care associated infections. The “leading edge” of a hospital curtain, estimated to be the edge most frequently touched, likely plays a role in health care associated infections at hospitals. The aims of this study were to (1) compare the bacterial load of the edge vs the middle of curtains in the MICU, and (2) determine the identity and distribution of relevant pathogens colonizing them.
Methods
The edge and middle sections of 8 curtains in MICU rooms (4 contact precaution and 4 noncontact precaution) were sampled for culture on patient and staff sides. Bacterial loads of edges and middles were compared. Select isolates were further analyzed for species identification.
Results
There was a statistically significant difference for the contact (t = 2.10, P = .047) and noncontact (t = 2.62, P = .016) rooms, with the edges having a significantly higher median than the middles. Pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus, Klebsiella, and Acinetobacter were found on the curtains, though at lower rates than in previous studies. Opportunistic fungi were also found on all curtains.
Conclusions
Results of this study confirm that hospital curtains, most notably the edge but also the middle, are contaminated with pathogens, and that these areas are frequently touched by health care workers in between hand hygiene."

Humans are generally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, which has caused a global pandemic of COVID-19. The screening of infected people in the population still mainly depends on clinical symptoms. However, there is limited research on the characteristics of clinical symptoms in different populations, especially in imported cases.
Methods
To retrospectively analyze the clinical data of 494 confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to a designated hospital in Shanghai from January 20, 2020, to March 31, 2020, we compared the clinical manifestations in different populations and their influencing factors in COVID-19 patients.
Results
(1) Of the 494 patients, 453 (91.7%) had different symptoms at admission, and 39 (7.89%) patients were asymptomatic. (2) We compared the symptoms of patients according to different stratifications and found the following results: a. The proportion of dyspnea was significantly higher in male patients than in female patients (P < 0.05). b. The proportions of a stuffy nose, sore throat, and olfactory and gustatory dysfunction were significantly higher in children than in adult patients (P < 0.05). c. The proportions of fever, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and fatigue were significantly higher in local cases than in imported cases. In comparison, the proportions of nasal congestion, stuffy nose, sore throat, headache, and olfactory and gustatory dysfunction were significantly lower in imported cases than in imported cases (P < 0.05). d. The proportions of chest tightness, shortness of breath, and dyspnea were significantly higher in severely ill patients than in those with mild symptoms (P < 0.05). (3) Thirty-one asymptomatic patients were significantly younger than symptomatic patients, and they had a higher proportion of imported cases, white blood cell (WBC) and lymphocyte (LYM) count levels, and fewer abnormal CT cases than the group of symptomatic patients (P < 0.05). (4) The number of days since the onset of the disease needed for the symptoms to disappear was associated with the epidemiological history (imported cases), the number of days until the pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test turned negative, the days of hospitalization, the days of onset, and the WBC and LYM count levels (P < 0.05).
Conclusion
The majority of COVID-19 patients (91.7%) had early symptoms. whereas 7.89% of COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic. Younger patients had fewer symptoms, mainly the upper respiratory symptoms, and the illness condition was milder, which was more common in imported cases. Elderly male patients had severe symptoms when admitted. The number of days needed for the patient's symptoms to disappear was closely related to the number of days necessary for the pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test to turn negative."

Methods
We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with newly diagnosed VTE but no IVC filter (N = 4,053) and patients with IVC filter (N = 635) admitted to a metropolitan hospital system from 2006 to 2009 comparing incidence of BSI within 1 year of inclusion.

Results
Patients with an IVC filter placed were more likely to be older with higher Charlson co-morbidity score (median 4 vs 1; P < .001). The incidence of BSI was not different between the group with IVC filter and the group without (10.7% vs 8.8%; P = .12).

The increased demand for hip arthroplasty means a growing number of postsurgical complications. This study aims to assess the risk of surgical site infection (SSI) in a teaching hospital; develop regional, national and international external comparisons; and evaluate SSI-related risk factors, particularly according to the timing of surgery (urgent/unplanned or elective).
Methods
Prospective cohort study from January 2008 to December 2018. Patients were followed up to 90 days after surgery. Primary endpoint was SSI incidence according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria. Multivariate analysis was conducted to find independently associated SSI risk factors. The association between risk factors and SSI incidence was assessed by reference to odds ratio (OR). Analyses were also performed among urgent/unplanned and elective patients to identify whether SSI risk factors differed between groups.
Results
The study population (n = 1,808) has an overall SSI rate of 3.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.4-3.9). Timing of surgery caused an effect modification, so surgery duration> 75th percentile (OR: 3.8; 95% CI: 1.5-9.8) and inadequate preparation (OR: 3.3; 95% CI: 1.1-10.0) were independent risk factors in the urgent/unplanned group; National Healthcare Safety Network risk index≥ 2 (OR: 6.3; 95% CI: 0.1-19.2) and transfusion (OR: 3.6; 95% CI: 1.1-11.9) in the elective group.
Conclusions
Hospital infection surveillance systems allow identifying risk factors susceptible to change. Characterization of factors that caused an effect modification is key to identify areas of quality improvement, including reducing operating times, preventing perioperative blood transfusion, or improving patient preparation before surgery."

abstract = "Background
Infectious diseases can be transmitted via fomites (contaminated surfaces/objects); disinfection can interrupt this transmission route. However, disinfection guidelines for low-resource outbreak settings are inconsistent and not evidence-based.
Methods
A systematic review of surface disinfection efficacy studies was conducted to inform low-resource outbreak guideline development. Due to variation in experimental procedures, outcomes were synthesized in a narrative summary focusing on chlorine-based disinfection against 7 pathogens with potential to produce outbreaks in low-resource settings (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella spp., hepatitis A virus, rotavirus, norovirus, and Ebola virus).
Results
Data were extracted from 89 laboratory studies and made available, including 20 studies on relevant pathogens used in combination with surrogate data to determine minimum target concentration × time (“CT”) factors. Stainless steel (68%) and chlorine-based disinfectants (56%) were most commonly tested. No consistent trend was seen in the influence of chlorine concentration and exposure time on disinfection efficacy. Disinfectant application mode; soil load; and surface type were frequently identified as influential factors in included studies.
Conclusions
This review highlights that surface disinfection efficacy estimates are strongly influenced by each study's experimental conditions. We therefore recommend laboratory testing to be followed by field-based testing/monitoring to ensure effectiveness is achieved in situ."

abstract = "Background
Medical procedures and patient care activities may facilitate environmental shedding of health care-associated pathogens.
Methods
We conducted a cohort study of hospitalized patients in contact precautions for carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing gram-negative bacilli (N = 38) or carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacilli (CR-GNB) (N = 22) to determine the frequency of environmental shedding during procedures and care activities. Perirectal, wound, and skin were cultured for ESBL-producing and CR-GNB. High-touch surfaces and portable equipment were disinfected before and cultured after procedures; control cultures were collected in the absence of procedures.
Results
Of 60 patients enrolled, 34 (57%) had positive perirectal and/or skin or wound cultures. For these 34 patients, 15 (44%) shed their colonizing organism to surfaces during 1 or more procedures. Patients with shedding had significantly higher concentrations of the pathogens recovered from perirectal swabs than those with no shedding (mean, 3.5 vs 2.2 log10 colony-forming units per swab; P < .01). Environmental shedding occurred more frequently during procedures and care activities than in the absence of a procedure (21 of 117, 18% vs 1 of 61, 2%; P < .01), and 6 of 56 (10%) portable devices used for procedures became contaminated.
Conclusions
Environmental shedding of antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacilli occurs frequently during medical procedures and patient care activities. Decontamination of surfaces and equipment and approaches that reduce the burden of carriage could reduce the risk for dissemination."

In the United States, nosocomial infections are estimated to cause 72,000 annual deaths. The stethoscope, commonly used, is rarely reported as a potential vector. Our study aims to describe stethoscope contamination and the effect of self-reported cleaning practices among health care providers in a community hospital setting.
Methods
Stethoscopes were collected at random times from health care providers and cultured per standard techniques. Providers answered a structured questionnaire related to their cleaning practices. Differences in bacterial growth rates and the impact of profession, cleaning frequency, and prior sanitization were evaluated.
Results
Of 104 cultured stethoscopes, 44% were from residents and medical students, from which 76% had bacterial growth, and 56% were from attendings, nurses, and respiratory therapists who had 91.4% growth (95% = confidence interval 0.62-0.86 and 0.81-0.96, respectively). Overall, 86.5% of providers claimed disinfection frequency compliant with Center for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines but there were no statistical differences between self-reported cleaning frequency or methods, and the presence of bacteria.
Conclusions
Most stethoscopes are contaminated with bacteria, the presence of which was not affected by reported cleaning strategies."

abstract = "Introduction
As has happened in other emerging respiratory pandemics, demand for N95 filtering facemask respirators (FFRs) has far exceeded their manufacturing production and availability in the context of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. One of the proposed strategies for mitigating the massive demand for N95 FFRs is their reuse after a process of decontamination that allows the inactivation of any potentially infectious material on their surfaces. This article aims to summarize all of the available evidence on the different decontamination methods that might allow disposable N95 FFRs to be reused, with emphasis on decontamination from SARS-CoV-2.
Methods
We performed a systematic review of the literature in order to identify studies reporting outcomes of at least 1 decontamination method for inactivating or removing any potentially infectious material from the surface of N95 FFRs, specifically addressing issues related to reduction of the microbial threat (including SARS-CoV-2 when available), maintaining the function of N95 FFRs and a lack of residual toxicity.
Results
We identified a total of 15 studies reporting on the different decontamination methods that might allow disposable N95 FFRs to be reused, including small-scale energetic methods and disinfecting solutions/spray/wipes. Among these decontamination methods, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation and vaporized hydrogen peroxide seem to be the most promising decontamination methods for N95 FFRs, based on their biocidal efficacy, filtration performance, fitting characteristics, and residual chemical toxicity, as well as other practical aspects such as the equipment required for their implementation and the maximum number of decontamination cycles.
Conclusions
Although all the methods for the decontamination and reuse of N95 FFRs have advantages and disadvantages, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation and vaporized hydrogen peroxide seem to be the most promising methods."

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a well-known cause of health care-associated diarrhea. Data about CDI epidemiology of Turkey is limited. This study investigates CDI incidence, clinical characteristics, and factors associated with severe CDI in a tertiary care center university hospital.
Methods
This is a case control study was conducted between 2012 and 2016. We included all patients, 18 years of age or more, with CDI diagnosis. For each patient diagnosed with CDI, information was collected concerning the severity of disease, treatment regimen, treatment response, disease recurrence, 30-day case fatality. Cases defined as severe hospital acquired CDI (HA-CDI) and controls defined as non-severe CDI patients.
Results
We identified 100 cases of HA-CDI out of 111 patients. Total CDI incidence was 1.19/10,000 patient-days. The incidence decreased 32.5% during the study period. We identified severe CDI in 24% of patients. Age and admission to intensive care unit were independent risk factors for severe CDI.
Conclusion
This study reports a 5-year prospective epidemiology of CDI in a tertiary care center in Istanbul, Turkey. The findings of this study suggest that HA-CDI incidence and proportion of severe CDI is low compared to European and US literature. We believe that CDI is underreported, neglected but still an important health care associated infection in Turkey."

The effectiveness of repeated vaccination for seasonal influenza remains controversial. Here, we measured antibody responses to the influenza virus (A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B) in a closed cohort of older participants vaccinated against influenza virus in each of 5 consecutive years.
Methods
One hundred and 11 volunteers aged >61 years were vaccinated subcutaneously with 1 dose (0.5 ml) of inactivated influenza vaccine as recommended by the World Health Organization from the 2005-2006 season through the 2009-2010 season. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers were determined.
Results
HI antibody titers against all 3 virus strains were significantly higher at 4 weeks after vaccination than at a time point prior to vaccination in each of the 5 seasons (P < .01); HI antibody titers were detected at the original prevaccination levels just prior to re-vaccination the following year. Sero-protection and HI antibody titers at 4 weeks after vaccination were similar against all influenza strains and during most of the 5 seasons evaluated. Vaccine strain changes were associated with specific immune responses in 9 of 12 (75%) intervals.
Conclusions
Taken together, our results suggest that annual vaccination is necessary to maintain humoral immunity for the elderly population. Furthermore, our findings revealed that annual seasonal vaccination was not associated with reduced vaccine effectiveness, and that the reformation of the vaccine resulted in amplified immune responses among those undergoing yearly vaccination in the elderly population."

Background
Each day operating theatres produce lots of waste. The wrong segregation represents both an environmental and economic problem, which is reflected in increased disposal cost and in a loss of resources.
Aim
To examine waste segregation by medical and non-medical healthcare personnel in an Italian hospital's operating theatres.
Methods
We used an observational tool, according to the local regulations and validated by a panel of experts.
Result
57% of waste were disposed of incorrectly, of these 71% could have been recycled and 1% recovered. The pre-operative phase had the greatest production of waste (48%) and the highest percentage of incorrect differentiation (72%). 66% of waste handled as “undifferentiated” could have been recycled. Waste managed as hazardous that could have been recycled, reused or otherwise segregated stood at 54%. Hazardous waste was managed incorrectly in 5% of the disposals.
Conclusion
The lack of a variety of bins for waste segregation and improper classification by personnel appear to be the cause of the incorrect segregation, which should be error free."

Bacteremia is the second cause of death in hemodialysis patients and colonization may be a risk factor. We analyzed the association between Staphylococcus aureus or multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria colonization and bacteremia in hemodialysis patients.
Methods
A prospective cohort study was conducted. Colonization status was determined at baseline, 2, and 6 months later. The time-to-first-bacteremia was analyzed using the baseline status and time-dependent nature of colonization. The recurrence of bacteremia given colonization status was evaluated using a Poisson regression model. The genetic relatedness between isolates that colonized and caused bacteremia were established by molecular typing methods.
Results
Seventy-one patients developed bacteremia over the course of follow-up, with the majority of cases being caused by S aureus (n = 28; 39.4%) and only three caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. S aureus colonization was associated with an increased risk of bacteremia in time-dependent analysis (HR:4.64; 95%CI: 1.72-12.53) and with recurrence of infection in Poisson model (IRR:5.90, 95%CI: 2.29-15.16). Molecular methods revealed that 77.8% of patients with S aureus bacteremia were colonized with the same strain that caused the infection.
Conclusions
S aureus is a cause of endogenous infection in hemodialysis patients. Colonization is associated with both time-to-first-bacteremia and the recurrence of infection. The prompt identification of colonized patients and the evaluation of decolonization protocols are needed."

We performed a cross-sectional study to assess infection preventionists’ (IP) surveillance practices across acute-care US hospitals. We collected self-reported annual facility standardized infection ratios for colon surgery and abdominal hysterectomy as provided by the National Healthcare Safety Network. Trend analysis using Kendall's rank correlation evaluated the association between surveillance rigor and SSI rates.
Results
Among 492 participating hospitals, 63%, 15%, 13%, and 8% were community, university-affiliated, critical access, and ambulatory surgical centers, respectively. Most critical access hospitals (82%) and ambulatory surgical centers (98%) reported less than one full time IP (P ≤ 0.001). University-affiliated medical centers spent significantly more time and used more data sources for monthly SSI review compared with other hospitals. Critical access hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers were more likely to rely on manual surveillance only (P < 0.001). The number of different data sources used for SSI surveillance was positively associated with higher SSI rates: (KT 0.14, p = 0.028 for colon SSI in 2017; KT 0.20, p=0.009 for hysterectomy SSI in 2016; KT 0.25, p=0.001 for hysterectomy SSI in 2017).

The objective is to know the evolution of the Degree of Compliance with Recommendations (DCR) on hand hygiene (HH) and its associated factors in the pediatric care areas (PCAs) of a tertiary hospital.
Methods
Observational, cross-sectional study, repeated over time, with direct observation of the DCR on HH during the daily activity of health care workers. Over 13 years, 9226 HH opportunities were observed. Associations between DCR, PCA and other variables (eg, age, sex, and professional position) were examined using χ² and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
Results
DCR on HH in 9 PCAs was 64.3% (95% CI, 63.3-65.3), and in the group of non-pediatric areas it was 49.6% (95% CI, 49.1-50.1). The areas with the highest degree of compliance were Oncology 72.8% (95% CI, 69.2-76.4), Neonatology 73.2% (95% CI, 71.3-75.1), and Neonatal intensive care unit 70.0% (95% CI, 67.5-72.6).

Methods
We surveyed cultures from the NICU environment in December 2017. We found that areas close to infants harbored more bacteria. We implemented routine scrubbing to control sites with the most bacteria starting from January 2018. We retrospectively reviewed and compared the data between the pre (2017) and post (2018) intervention periods.
Results
A total of 916 infants were included; 10 CLABSI episodes were identified, 9 and 1 episodes in the pre- and postintervention periods, respectively. We found that the incidence of CLABSI decreased significantly among all admitted infants (P = .006) and also among very low birth weight infants (P = .085). The number of CLABSI cases per 1,000 central line days decreased from 1.89 in 2017 to 0.23 in 2018 (P = .018). The most common bacterial species found in the cultures established from the NICU environment were identical to the CLABSI-causing coagulase-negative Staphylococcus.

The incidence of Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) infections is worrisome. Previous studies have shown that increased antibiotic treatment might affect the resistance profile of this organism. The objective of this study was to describe the resistance profile of KP strains and to correlate it with antibiotics consumption.
Methods
A retrospective observational analysis was performed to examine exposure to antibiotics and resistant profile, comparing the results of different measuring outcomes of resistance (the incidence and the percentage of resistant KP) during January 2012 to June 2019 by using the autoregressive integrated moving average and transfer function model.
Results
During the study period, the use of some third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems continued to increase and a total of 5,519 KP isolates were collected. There were positive relationships between amikacin-resistant KP, ciprofloxacin-resistant KP, and corresponding antibiotic use in the transfer function models; both for the incidence rate and the resistant rate (time lag = 0) (P < .05).
Conclusions
The present study confirms that the history of amikacin or ciprofloxacin use influences the susceptibility of these agents against KP with no delay. Similar results were obtained with different measuring outcomes of resistance."

Prior to implementing an antibiotic stewardship intervention for asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB), we assessed institutional barriers to change using the Organizational Readiness to Change Assessment.
Methods
Surveys were self-administered on paper in inpatient medicine and long-term care units at 4 Veterans Affairs facilities. Participants included providers, nurses, and pharmacists. The survey included 7 subscales: evidence (perceived strength of evidence) and six context subscales (favorability of organizational context). Responses were scored on a 5-point Likert-type scale.
Results
One hundred four surveys were completed (response rate = 69.3%). Overall, the evidence subscale had the highest score; the resources subscale (mean 2.8) was significantly lower than other subscales (P < .001). Scores for budget and staffing resources were lower than scores for training and facility resources (P < .001 for both). Pharmacists had lower scores than providers for the staff culture subscale (P = .04). The site with the lowest scores for resources (mean 2.4) also had lower scores for leadership and lower pharmacist effort devoted to stewardship.

The objective of this quality improvement project was to develop, implement and sustain a colon SSI prevention bundle and determine which bundle components are most strongly associated with prevention of SSI.
Methods
The bundle was developed and implemented in a 525 bed Level I trauma hospital and included pre-, intra- and postoperative components. Bundle adherence and SSI rate were continually tracked and communicated to surgeons and nursing staff throughout project. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the components associated with lowest SSI rates.
Results
There were 280 elective and urgent/emergent colon surgeries between October 2015 and March 2018. Over 60% had preoperative components, 76.5% had intraoperative components and 55.6% had postoperative bundle components with a nonsignificant decreasing trend in SSI rate of −0.5 SSI/100 procedures per quarter. The multivariate analysis suggested that use of 2% chlorhexidine gluconate/70% alcohol skin prep, use of wound protector and change of gloves for fascial closure were associated with fewer SSI.
Discussion
The implementation of a colon SSI prevention bundle in a Level I trauma hospital with pre-, intra- and postoperative components was described. Future directions include focusing implementation efforts on bundle components that significantly prevent SSI to improve adherence."

Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) is an urgent public health threat globally. Limited data are available regarding the epidemiology of CRE in South Florida. We describe the epidemiology of CRE within a large public healthcare system in Miami, FL, the experience with an internal registry, active surveillance testing, and the impact of infection prevention practices.
Methods
Retrospective cohort study in 4 hospitals from a large healthcare system in Miami-Dade County, FL from 2012 to 2016. The internal registry included all CRE cases from active surveillance testing from rectal and/or tracheal screening occurring in the intensive care units of 2 of the hospitals and clinical cultures across the healthcare system. All CRE cases were tagged in the electronic medical record and automatically entered into a platform for automatic infection control surveillance. The system alerted about new cases, readmissions, and transfers.
Results
A total of 371 CRE cases were identified. The overall prevalence was 0.077 cases per 100 patient-admissions; the admission prevalence was 0.019 per 100 patient-admissions, and the incidence density was 1.46 cases per 10,000 patient-days. Rates increased during the first 3 years of the study and declined later to a lower level than at the beginning of study period.
Conclusions
Active surveillance testing and the use of an internal registry facilitated prompt identification of cases contributing to control increasing rates of CRE by rapid implementation of infection prevention strategies."

Additional health care costs associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) vary widely per country; none of which have been explored in Japan. Thus, we aimed to examine the economic and clinical effects of VAP in Japan.
Methods
This was a retrospective matched case-control study of 22 patients with VAP who were treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Yokohama Rosai Hospital between January 2012 and December 2018. Twenty-two matched controls were selected based on five variables (i.e., sex, age, diagnosis and surgical procedure, underlying disease with or without advanced malignant tumor, and best motor response). The additional health care costs incurred owing to VAP were calculated from the difference between the mean costs of VAP and control cases.
Results
VAP incurred an additional cost of approximately USD 34,884 per case. The length of hospitalization itself was the major factor contributing to additional medical costs, generating a difference of 9,824 USD.
Discussion
VAP not only worsens patient outcomes but also generates significant additional medical costs. Patients who had developed VAP required more medical resources such as the performance of a tracheostomy.
Conclusions
VAP incurs a higher mean total hospital medical cost. Thus, appropriate infection control strategies should be implemented."

Evaluate the presence of bacteria and resistance profile in stethoscopes used by healthcare professionals and its consequences within the hospital environment.
Method
It is a systematic review, in which articles indexed in the BVS, CAPES-Periódicos, Cochrane Library, PubMed, SciELO and ScienceDirect databases were searched.
Results
Twenty-two articles were selected for this study. The significant majority of professionals does not perform hygiene of the stethoscope, either due to the lack of instructions or the lack of knowledge about the contamination's risks. In addition, over these 22 articles evaluated, only 10 demonstrated that more than 50% of the analyzed samples were contaminated with some type of bacteria. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter spp., Pseudomonas spp. and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most recurrent pathogens. Besides that, multiresistant strains were also isolated, highlighting resistance to Ampicillin and Clindamycin.
Conclusion
Indeed, the stethoscope is a potential disseminator of bacterial infections. The contamination is explained by the possible cross reactions that make the transmission of infectious agents possible. Cleaning before and after each auscultate is an efficient alternative to minimize these pathogens."

Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are common and often preventable complications of care, with reduction emphasized in national policy. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services introduced an HAI-focused Hospital Acquired Condition Reduction Program in 2015 to penalize poor-performing hospitals. Standardized infection ratios (SIRs) are used for comparisons between healthcare organizations, though they are not adjusted for socioeconomic risks known to impact infection. The objectives of this study were to assess the relationship between hospital-area deprivation with reported SIRs and reimbursement penalties.
Methods
This was a cohort study using 2018 Hospital Compare, as well as area deprivation data and other hospital characteristics. Multivariable regression models were used to evaluate associations between hospital-area deprivation and SIR reporting as well as payment reduction, adjusting for case mix index and hospital ownership.
Results
Of the 2102 unique hospitals in our study, 12.8% reported at least one worse than national benchmark SIR and 23.7% had a payment reduction. After adjustment, there was a 17% increased risk of reporting worse than benchmarked SIRs with quartile increases in deprivation (95% confidence interval: 5%-30%, P = .004). Despite this, there were no significant relationships between reimbursement penalties and ADI (risk ratio: 1.00, 95% confidence interval: 0.997-1.005, P = .567).
Conclusions
This study documented a significant relationship between hospital-area deprivation and the risk of reporting worse than national benchmark SIRs. Though this did not appear to translate to Hospital Acquired Condition Reduction Program penalties in this dataset, it reinforces problems with the current use of SIRs for interhospital comparisons."

We report 2 consecutive outbreaks of the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) in an intensive care unit (ICU) and describe its characteristics and consequences.
Methods
Over a 72-day period, a multidisciplinary ICU team detected 2 distinct periods of high and unusual incidence of Bcc isolates that were recovered from cultures of endotracheal aspirate. Cultures of tap water, ultrasound gel and mouthwash (opened and unopened bottles) were performed. Bcc was identified with the BD-Phoenix and MALDI-TOF MS systems, with molecular typing using the enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-polymerase chain reaction technique.
Results
In both outbreak 1 (6 patients) and outbreak 2 (5 patients), the point sources of Bcc were chlorhexidine mouthwashes of 2 different brands, both of them intrinsically contaminated. All patients had a clinical diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and 6 died. MALDI-TOF MS identified 2 species of Bcc (B. cenocepacia and B. cepacia). Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-polymerase chain reaction typing confirmed 100% genetic similarity between patient and mouthwash isolates from each period. The first outbreak was controlled in 20 days and the second in 6 days.
Conclusions
The surveillance program for multidrug-resistant organisms, especially in high-risk patients, with the active participation of a multidisciplinary team, was crucial for success in controlling these outbreaks."

Background
On March 27, 2020, the city of Philadelphia was given permission by Temple University to convert the Liacouras Center gymnasium to an alternate care site (ACS) to treat low-acuity COVID-19 patients. ACS's, especially those created to specifically care for infectious patients, require a robust infection prevention and control (IPC) program.
Methods
The IPC program was led by a physician and nurse partnership, both of whom had substantial experience developing IPC programs in U.S. and low-resource settings. The IPC program was framed on a previously described conceptual model commonly referred to as the “4S's”: Space, Staff, Stuff, and Systems.
Results
The gymnasium was transformed into red, yellow and green infection hazard zones. The IPC team trained 425 staff in critical IPC practices and personal protective equipment (PPE) standards. Systems to detect staff illness were created and over 3550 staff health screening surveys completed.
Discussion
Use of existing guidance and comprehensive facility and patient management assessments guided the development of the IPC program. Program priorities were to keep staff and patients safe and implement procedures to judiciously use limited resources that affect infection transmission.
Conclusion
Planning, executing and evaluating IPC standards and requirements of an ACS during a pandemic requires creative and nimble strategies to adapt, substitute, conserve, reuse, and reallocate IPC space, staff, stuff and systems."

Monitoring healthcare workers’ (HCWs) hand hygiene (HH) performance is recommended for improving compliance. Observer biases challenge data validity, thus supplemental approaches such as video observation are needed to complement monitoring.
Methods
We investigate first-person view (FPV) video observation during simulated standardized patient care handling a catheter in a study with 71 HCWs. HH performance was evaluated for (1) all HH opportunities and (2) a subset of opportunities required in an ideal work sequence, hereafter core opportunities. HCWs’ acceptance of FPV video observation and usability judgments were assessed.
Results
Compliance level for core HH opportunities (M = 43.5%) was significantly higher than compliance considering all opportunities (M = 30.4%, t(70) = 8.493, P < .001). Reducing HH opportunities to core opportunities would significantly increase compliance levels from the observed average of 30.4% to 44.9% (t(70) = 12.822, P < .001). Overall, both usability ratings and acceptance of the body camera were promising.
Discussion
FPV video observation in simulated standardized patient care provides new instruments to evaluate HH performance beyond mere compliance rates. Our results emphasize the role of optimizing workflow in order to improve HCW's HH compliance.
Conclusions
FPV video observation in a standardized patient care simulation is feasible and offers information for HH interventions that target actual deficiencies."

Lately, suggestions have been emphasizing the importance of engaging patients and family members in infection control (IC) through participation and education after showing that patients and family members can aid in preventing the transmission of health care-associated infections. However, assessing patient education on IC measures in hospitals is poorly investigated.
Purpose
To identify all available studies in the literature that assessed hospitalized patients’ education on IC measures.
Methods
PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL were searched from inception till May 6, 2020 without restrictions. We used Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology tool for assessing the reporting quality of each eligible study.
Main Findings
Of the 6,740 identified papers, 25 were eligible for inclusion. Education on health care-associated infections was investigated in 8 studies, education on central line-associated bloodstream infections in 1, education on surgical site infections in 2, education on hand hygiene in 12, education on isolation rationale, precautions, usage of personal protective equipment in 3, and education on respiratory hygiene in 1. In general, a low percentage of patient education on IC was found in most of the included papers.
Conclusions
The low percentage of patient education on IC in hospitals highlights the need for additional emphasis on patient involvement in IC. Further studies are needed to assess patient education on several IC measures and to explore the education of family members as well."

Methods
A national on-line survey was performed with members of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) who participate in the recruitment and hiring of IPs in their organization. Descriptive statistics were calculated for respondent and organizational demographics, IP recruitment strategies and hiring practices.
Results
In the fall of 2019, 522 APIC members from 101 of 113 APIC chapters (89% chapter response rate) participated in the survey. A vacant IP position was reported by 25% (n = 126) of respondents. Recent IP hires were primarily nurses (70%; n = 346) recruited from outside the organization (54%; n = 270). Online job-boards (e.g., Indeed, Monster) and internal organizational job postings were the most frequently used recruitment strategies.

On February 11, 2020 WHO designated the name “COVID-19” for the disease caused by “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2), a novel virus that first occurred in Wuhan, China, but quickly turned into a global pandemic. As of June 29, 2020, it has claimed 502,947 lives and is present in more than 213 countries worldwide. Risks associated with acquiring the virus and with its severe outcomes have been reported in various studies, which has led health organizations and governments to develop and institute a variety of preventative and control measures. With constantly growing scientific understanding on this topic, updated information can help equip health and public sectors with the most current knowledge. In this literature review we explore the prevalence of comorbidity among individuals with COVID-19 and summarize our findings based on information available as of May 15, 2020. Overall, we found that comorbidities including Hypertension (27.4%), Diabetes (17.4%), and Cardiovascular Disease (8.9%) are quite prevalent in COVID-19 patients across major epicenters worldwide and is associated with increased disease severity but not clearly to fatality (OR 0.83, CI[0.60-0.99], p <0.05). Understanding of COVID-19 characteristics and association to common global health problems may provide support and direction to policy makers, clinicians, and researchers in developing shielding strategies to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic and its severe outcomes."

Background
Transmission of respiratory viruses between staff and residents of pediatric long-term care facilities (pLTCFs) can occur. We assessed the feasibility of using text or email messages to perform surveillance for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) among staff.
Methods
From December 7, 2016 to May 7, 2017, 50 staff participants from two pLTCFs received weekly text or email requests to report the presence or absence of ARI symptoms. Those who fulfilled the ARI case definition (≥2 symptoms) had respiratory specimens collected to detect viruses by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays. Pre- and post-surveillance respiratory specimens were collected to assess subclinical viral shedding.
Results
The response rate to weekly electronic messages was 93%. Twenty-one ARIs reported from 20 (40%) participants fulfilled the case definition. Respiratory viruses were detected in 29% (5/17) of specimens collected at symptom onset (influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus [CoV] 229E, rhinovirus [RV], and dual detection of CoV OC43 and bocavirus). Four participants had positive pre-surveillance (4 RV), and six had positive post-surveillance specimens (3 RV, 2 CoV NL63 and 1 adenovirus).

Objective
While the literature suggests the use of SESDs has had successful results for device securement, it is unknown to what extent they may impact CLABSI rates. Securement and stabilization performance among devices may be a direct risk factor for CLABSIs.
Methods
A retrospective quality review of 7,776 cases was conducted at a large academic medical center. The primary researcher implemented a quantitative design which was analyzed with demographics statistics and relative risk ratio.
Results
There was a 288% (n = 47) increase in relative risk of CLABSI found in the AESD group compared to the SESD group. The results imply the use of SESDs may improve nursing practice and patient outcomes lowering CLABSI rates in patients with PICCs by a reduction of risks associated with securement design differences."

Contaminated environmental surfaces are important sources of transmission for healthcare-associated pathogens, including Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile. The effectiveness of manual bleach cleaning and pulsed xenon ultraviolet (PX-UV) disinfection on C. difficile contamination of hospital room high-touch surfaces in Japan was evaluated.
Methods
The environmental surfaces of 20 C. difficile infection (CDI) isolation rooms were sampled immediately after CDI patients were discharged or transferred. High-touch surfaces were sampled before and after either bleach cleaning or PX-UV disinfection in addition to nonbleach cleaning. Changes in the number of C. difficile-positive samples and bacterial counts for each cleaning method were assessed.
Results
Overall, 286 samples were collected (bleach cleaning, 144 samples; PX-UV disinfection, 142 samples). Before cleaning, the positive rates of C. difficile were 27.8% and 31.0% in bleach cleaning and PX-UV disinfection, respectively. Both bleach cleaning and PX-UV disinfection significantly reduced overall C. difficile-positive samples (P = .018 and P = .002, respectively) and C. difficile colony-forming unit counts (P = .002 and P = .001, respectively).
Conclusions
PX-UV disinfection in addition to manual nonbleach cleaning effectively reduces C. difficile contamination from high-touch surfaces. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the effect of PX-UV disinfection on CDI rates in Japanese hospitals."

Methods
This study used publicly available data to examine gender, age, source of infection, date returned from Hubei, date of disease onset, date of first medical visit, date of final diagnosis, and date of recovery of COVID-19 cases.
Results
Public-use data revealed similar risks of infection by age and that the numbers of new and final diagnoses of confirmed cases first increased, peaked at about 2 weeks, and then gradually decreased. The main sources of infection were firsthand or secondhand exposure in Hubei Province and contact with confirmed cases, which mostly involved contact with infected household members. The mean periods from disease onset to first medical visit, first visit to final diagnosis, and final diagnosis to recovery were 4.44, 3.18, and 13.42 days, respectively.
Conclusions
The results suggest that the measures taken to control the rate of infection were effective. Prevention and control efforts should respond as quickly as possible, isolate and control activities of individuals leaving infected areas, and restrict household contact transmission."

Previously, we found that an upward air current in the head area, induced by forced air warming (FAW), was completely counteracted by downward laminar airflow. However, this study did not include any consideration of the air-conditioner outlet layout (ACOL); hence, its impact remains unclear.
Methods
This study was performed in 2 operating rooms (ORs)—ISO classes 5 and 6, which are denoted as OR-5 and OR-6, respectively. Both ORs have distinct ACOLs. The cleanliness, or the number or ratio of shifting artificial particles was evaluated.
Results
During the first 5 minutes after particles generation, significantly more particles shifted into the surgical field in OR-5 when compared to OR-6 (13,587 [4,341-15,913] and 106 [41-338] particles/cubic foot, P < .0001). Notably, FAW did not increase the number of shifting particles in OR-6. The laminar airflow system fully counteracted the upward airflow caused by FAW in OR-6, where the ACOL covered the operating bed. However, this did not occur in OR-5, where the ACOL did not fully cover the operating bed.
Conclusions
Regardless of cleanliness ability of OR, an ACOL that fully covers the operating bed can prevent upward airflow in the head area and reduce the number of artificial particles shifting into the surgical field, which are typically caused by FAW."

Children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) are prone to infections, especially when hospitalized for the transplant or additional medical care. These infections are perceived to increase patient's mortality risk, but data are lacking. We conducted this study to assess the burden and the impact of hospital acquired infections (HAI) on mortality risk among pediatric HSCT patients.
Methods
This retrospective study included 169 patients that received allogeneic HSCT between 1/1/2011-7/6/2017 at Children's National Hospital, a tertiary referral center. Clinical and laboratory data were reviewed for one-year after transplant to determine HAI and survival status. The HAI incident rates stratified by bloodstream, respiratory, and gastrointestinal infections were then compared between deceased patients and survivors.
Results
Including transplant, 169 patients sustained 499 hospital admissions for total of 10,523 patient days and 112 HAI episodes, resulting in a HAI rate of 10.6 per 1000 patient-days. Within one-year after transplant,38 (22%) patient died, 30 (17.5%) with non-relapse related causes. Unadjusted univariate analysis revealed mortality correlated with cell source (p=0.035), donor type (p= 0.002), respiratory viral infections (p=0.015), and CLABSIs (P<0.001). Adjusted analysis revealed CLABSI and respiratory adenovirus infection independently increased mortality risk by 3-fold (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 3.22, 95% CI:1.30-8.00) and (HR: 3.32, 95% CI: 1.22 - 9.06), respectively.
Conclusions
In light of the high frequency of multiple factors contributing to mortality we are unable to determine the degree HAI contributed mortality. However, our findings suggest preventing CLABSIs and respiratory adenovirus infections are crucial to improve the one-year survival among pediatric HSCT patients."

During an ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, unsuspected cases may be housed outside of dedicated isolation wards.
Aim
At a Singaporean tertiary hospital, individuals with clinical syndromes compatible with COVID-19 but no epidemiologic risk were placed in cohorted general wards for COVID-19 testing. To mitigate risk, an infection control bundle was implemented comprising infrastructural enhancements, improved personal-protective-equipment (PPE), and social distancing. We assessed the impact on environmental contamination and transmission.
Method
Upon detection of a case of COVID-19 in the dedicated general ward, patients and healthcare workers (HCWs) contacts were identified. All patient and staff-close contacts were placed on 14-day phone surveillance and followed-up for 28 days; symptomatic contacts were tested. Environmental samples were also obtained.
Findings
Over a 3-month period, 28 unsuspected cases of COVID-19 were contained in the dedicated general ward. In 5 of the 28 cases, sampling of the patient's environment yielded SARS-CoV-2; index cases who required supplemental oxygen had higher odds of environmental contamination (p=0.01). A total of 253 staff close-contacts and 45 patient close-contacts were identified; only 3 HCWs (1.2%, 3/253) required quarantine. On 28-day follow-up, no patient-to-HCW transmission was documented; only one symptomatic patient close-contact tested positive.
Conclusion
Our institution successfully implemented an intervention bundle to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in a multi-bedded cohorted general ward setting."

Manual disinfection of medical devices is prone to failure. Disinfection by aerosolized hydrogen peroxide might be a promising adjunctive method. We aimed to assess effectiveness of dry mist of hydrogen peroxide (HPDM) on noncritical medical equipment.
Methods
One cycle of HPDM was applied on a convenience sample of 16 different types of "ready to use" noncritical medical devices in a closed, but nonsealed room. Of every object, 2 adjacent areas with assumed similar bacterial burden were swabbed before and after HPDM deployment, respectively. After culturing, colony forming units (CFU) were counted, and bacterial burden per cm2 calculated.
Results
Of 160 objects included in the study, 36 (23%) showed a CFU-count of zero both before and after HPDM use. A decrease from a median of 0.14 CFU/cm2 (range: 0.00-125.00/cm2) to a median of 0.00 CFU/cm2 (range: 0.00-4.00/cm2) (P < .001) was observed. The bacterial burden was reduced by more than 90% in 45% (95% CI: 37-53) of objects. No pathogenic bacteria were identified.
Discussion
HPDM reduced bacterial burden on noncritical medical items. Since cleanliness of the included "ready to use" objects was high and no pathogens were found before nebulization, the HPDM device did not increase patient safety in this setting.
Conclusion
HPDM nebulization can be a useful nonmanual adjunctive disinfection method in high-risk settings."

Approximately 721,800 hospital acquired infections occur annually, generating an estimated $10 billion in provider costs. Proper hand hygiene (HH) prevents hospital acquired infections, yet compliance is low. Electronic hand hygiene monitoring systems (EHHMS) are a potential solution, tracking and signaling HH events.
Methods
We explored adoption of EHHMS in New York State acute care hospitals through a survey and interviews. Trend analysis was used to evaluate the impact of EHHMS on hospital-acquired Clostridium difficile infection (HA-CDI) rates.
Results
Survey respondents represented approximately 30% (N = 56) of the total population of hospitals (N = 184) and EHHMS adoption was low (N = 2). The primary reason for nonadoption was cost (79.6%). HH compliance increased 20%-30% and HA-CDI decreased 70% for one hospital after an EHHMS, though not sustained; robust HH culture was mentioned as a necessary accompaniment. The trend analysis showed negligible impact on HA-CDI post-EHHMS for the second hospital. A critical access hospital without an EHHMS reported HH compliance of 90% attributed to strong HH culture.
Conclusions
Proliferation of EHHMS is low in New York State acute care hospitals and its impact on HH compliance and infection rates is questionable. Putting technology aside, strong HH culture seems essential for high compliance."

: Contact precautions (CP) are a widely adopted strategy to prevent cross-transmission of organisms, commonly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). Some hospitals have discontinued CP for patients with MRSA or VRE; however, the impact on hospital-acquired infection rates (HAI) has not been assessed systematically.
Methods
: Retrospective multicenter interrupted time series between 2002 and 2017 at three academic hospitals. Participating hospitals discontinued CP for patients with contained body fluids who were colonized or infected with MRSA or VRE. The primary intervention was stopping the use of CP.  Secondary interventions were horizontal infection prevention strategies. The primary outcomes were rates of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI), catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), mediastinal surgical site infection (SSI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to MRSA, VRE, or any organism using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) surveillance definitions.
Results
:  CLABSI, CAUTI, SSI, and VAP rates trended down at each institution. There were no statistically significant increases in these infections associated with discontinuing CP. Individual horizontal infection prevention strategies variably impacted HAI outcomes.
Conclusions
: Stopping the routine use of CP for patients with contained body fluids who are colonized or infected with MRSA or VRE did not result in increased HAIs. Bundled horizontal infection prevention strategies resulted in sustained HAI reductions."

The COVID-19 outbreak has highlighted the role of hospital-acquired infections in spreading epidemics. Adequately cleaning surfaces in patient rooms is an essential part of this fight to reduce the spread. Traditional audits, however, are insufficient. This study assesses surface cleaning practices using ultravoilet (UV) marker technology and the extent to which this technology can help improve cleaning audits and practices.
Methods
One hundred and forty-four audits (1,235 surfaces) were retrieved. UV-marker cleaning audits conducted at a major teaching hospital in 2018 after implementing a new cleaning protocol. In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted with cleaning staff and supervisors.
Results
On average, 63% of surfaces were appropriately cleaned. Toilet handles (80%) and toilet seats underside (83%) scored highest while main room sink fixtures (54%), light switch (55%), and bedrails (56%) scored lowest. Training, staffing and time constraints may play a role in low cleaning rates.
Discussion
The high-touch patient surfaces in the bedroom remain neglected and a potential source of infections. UV marker audits provided an objective measure of cleaning practices that managers and staff were unaware of.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is already a pandemic. Few studies investigated the epidemic characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak in the well-developed cities.
Methods
Epidemiological data of 136 confirmed COVID-19 cases were collected from the dataset of COVID-19 in Tianjin. All confirmed cases were categorized according to their potential infection sources. Daily numbers of confirmed cases of each category were plotted by date of onset, and the epidemic form of each category was inferred.
Results
Among the 136 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 48 cases were categorized as imported cases and their close contacts, which were the majority of early cases. A total of 43 cases were found an epidemiological link to the Baodi department store, and they were inferred to be a common-source outbreak. Additionally, 35 cases were considered as familial clusters of COVID-19 cases, and 10 cases were sporadic. The 45 cases were inferred to be a propagated epidemic.

The need for protective masks greatly exceeds their global supply during the current COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods
We optimized the temperature used in the dry heat pasteurization method to destroy pathogens and decontaminate masks while retaining their filtering capacity.
Results
The current study showed that dry heat at both 60°C and 70°C for 1 hour could successfully kill 6 species of respiratory bacteria and one fungi species, and inactivate the H1N1 indicator virus. After being heated at 70°C for 1, 2, and 3 hours, the N95 respirators and surgical face masks showed no changes in their shape and components. The filtering efficiency of bacterial aerosol for N95 respirators were 98%, 98%, and 97% after being heated for 1, 2, and 3 hour, respectively, all of which were over the 95% efficiency required and similar to the value before being heated (99%). The filtering efficiency for surgical face masks was 97%, 97%, and 96% for 1, 2, and 3 hours of heating, respectively, all of which were also similar to the value before being heated (97%).
Conclusions
This method can be used at home and can significantly resolve the current shortage of masks."

To investigate abdominal hysterectomy surgical site infection (SSI) rates before and after implementation of an SSI care bundle.
Methods
An SSI bundle for abdominal hysterectomies was introduced in our hospital in April 2014 to reduce the SSI rate. The practices were divided into bundle elements around preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care. We conducted a retrospective cohort study around implementation of the SSI care bundle. Women were included if they underwent abdominal hysterectomy between 2012 and 2015. They were then divided into 2 study groups: prebundle and postbundle. The primary study outcome was SSI rate. The superficial SSI rate was the secondary outcome.
Results
The overall SSI rate was 6.18% in the prebundle group, with a median monthly SSI rate of 7.03%. After bundle implementation, the overall SSI rate declined to 2.51% (P = .02). The reduction remained significant after multivariate analysis (adjusted odds ratio 0.38; 95% confidence interval 0.15-0.88; P = .03) indicating a 62% reduction in SSI postbundle as compared to prebundle.When comparing rates based on infection classification, superficial SSIs declined significantly from 3.73% in the prebundle group to 0.90% in the postbundle group (P = 0.02). Patient demographics and pre-existing medical conditions were similar pre- and postbundle. Compliance with bundle elements was high.
Conclusions
A significant reduction in SSI rate in abdominal hysterectomies was seen following implementation of an infection prevention bundle."

There are no previous studies on decreasing urine cultures in hospitalized internal medicine patients by a combination of physician education and reflex cancellation of urine cultures in those with a negative dipstick urinalysis.
Methods
We compared urine culture rates in all hospitalized internal medicine patients 18 years or older before intervening (2016), during medical education efforts (2017), and after reflex cancellation of urine cultures in patients with a negative dipstick (negative leukocyte esterase and nitrites) (2018, 2019).
Results
Compared to the preintervention period (2016), urine cultures decreased from a baseline of 32.7% (95% confidence intervals [95%CI]—31.7-33.6) to 26.6% (95%CI—25.8%-27.4%) after medical education efforts, and to 18.2% (95%CI—17.4%-19.0%) and to 15.2 (95%CI—14.5%-15.9%) during the 2 years after reflex cancellation of the urine cultures. There were no physician complaints and there were no urine cultures orders after reflex cancellation.
Conclusions
We conclude that physician education and cancellation of urine cultures in those with negative dipsticks resulted in a persistent decrease in urine cultures of around 50%. Extrapolation to other settings requires caution since the results are dependent on patient selection, physician behavior, and methods of urine testing."

Short-term peripheral venous catheters-related bloodstream infections (PVCR-BSIs) rates have not been systematically studied in developing countries, and data on their incidence by number of device-days are not available.
Methods
Prospective, surveillance study on PVCR-BSI conducted from September 1, 2013 to May 31, 2019 in 204 intensive care units (ICUs), members of the International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC), from 57 hospitals in 19 cities of India. We applied US INICC definition criteria and reported methods using the INICC Surveillance Online System.
Results
We followed 7,513 ICU patients for 296,893 bed-days and 295,795 short term peripheral venous catheter (PVC)-days. We identified 863 PVCR-BSIs, amounting to a rate of 2.91/1,000 PVC-days. Mortality in patients with PVC but without PVCR-BSI was 4.14%, and 11.59% in patients with PVCR-BSI. The length of stay in patients with PVC but without PVCR-BSI was 4.13 days, and 5.9 days in patients with PVCR-BSI. The micro-organism profile showed 68% of gram negative bacteria: Escherichia coli (23%), Klebsiella spp (15%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5%), and others. The predominant gram-positive bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (10%).
Conclusions
PVCR-BSI rates found in our ICUs were much higher than rates published from industrialized countries. Infection prevention programs must be implemented to reduce the incidence of PVCR-BSIs."

Co-colonization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) may result in the transfer of drug-resistant genes. The aim of this meta-analysis was to estimate the pooled co-colonization prevalence of MRSA and VRE.
Methods
We searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases. The co-colonization prevalence of MRSA and VRE was assessed by calculating the proportion and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled prevalence.
Results
Eleven eligible studies were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled co-colonization prevalence of MRSA and VRE in patients was 7% (95% CI, 5.0%-9.0%). The results of regression analysis showed that co-colonization prevalence of MRSA and VRE was related to study design, setting, screening sites, and detection methods. We found that male patients (odds ratio [OR], 1.58; 95% CI, 1.09-2.28), patients with comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.05-1.78), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.27-2.79), and use of indwelling devices (OR, 4.08; 95% CI, 2.21-7.53) were risk factors for co-colonization by MRSA and VRE.
Conclusions
The co-colonization prevalence of MRSA and VRE in the patients was common. Appropriate measures should be adopted to limit the horizontal transmission of MRSA and VRE to minimize the future potential for co-colonization and the transfer of resistance genes among these pathogens."

Researchers have found that lack of hand hygiene and environmental contamination are sources of infection transmission in the health care environment. One factor that may lead to lack of hand hygiene is alarm fatigue, the sensory overload that results when clinicians are exposed to an excessive number of alarms, causing them to silence alarms without taking proper precautions. In this study, we report hand hygiene compliance and infusion pump contamination in the context of infusion pump alarm prevalence.
Methods
Health care worker hand hygiene audits were conducted to determine percent compliance. Cultures were obtained from infusion pumps to determine environmental contamination. The frequency of alarms from August 4, 2019 to September 7, 2019 was determined.
Results
Hand hygiene compliance ranged from 50% to 87%. Pump contamination ranged from 20% to 70% per unit. A total of 116, 872 infusion pump alarms sounded in the hospital.
Discussion
Pumps were contaminated primarily with skin flora. This was demonstrated in the context of poor hand hygiene compliance and a high number of alarms, indicative of alarm fatigue.
Conclusions
The intersection of a high prevalence of infusion pump alarms and poor hand hygiene resulting in bacterial contamination of pumps could be a source of health care-associated infection transmission for patients."

Antibiotic resistance is a growing threat to public health. Despite various attempts at educating the public on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and judicial antibiotic use, fallacies and misconceptions remain. To successfully promote behavior change, various cognitive constructs pertaining to antibiotic behavior need to be identified and targeted.
Methods
Using the Arksey and O'Malley (2005) methodological framework, a credible reflexive examination of literature was conducted, permitting identification of a breadth of literature that pertained to the influence of cognitive constructs on public antimicrobial behavior.
Results
From 393 abstracts identified, 67 full articles were screened, and 43 papers were chosen for review. Three themes were identified (1) sociodemographic influences; (2) knowledge, misconceptions, and fallacies; and (3) public attitudes and the social influence of friends and family. Geographical location, education level, cognitive dissonance, and social norms were found to influence AMR cognition, resulting in disproportionate risk assessments that are facilitated by social information brokering.
Conclusions
Public AMR resilience, responsibility, and behavior compliance are influenced by cognitive constructs, which are liable to the appropriation of misconceptions, fallacies, and social behavior models obtained via information brokering. A cohesive multidisciplinary participatory approach to AMR management and interventional design that applies the influence of cognitive constructs to inform public AMR behavior compliance is recommended."

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) causes significant morbidity in nursing home residents. Our aim was to describe adherence to a bundled CDI prevention initiative, which had previously been deployed nationwide in Veterans Health Administration (VA) long-term care facilities (LTCFs), and to improve compliance with reinforcement.
Methods
A multicenter pre- and post-reinforcement of the VA bundle consisting of environmental management, hand hygiene, and contact precautions was conducted in 6 VA LTCFs. A campaign to reinforce VA bundle components, as well as to promote select antimicrobial stewardship recommendations and contact precautions for 30 days, was employed. Hand hygiene, antimicrobial usage, and environmental contamination, before and after bundle reinforcement, were assessed.
Results
All LTCFs reported following the guidelines for cleaning and contact precautions until diarrhea resolution pre-reinforcement. Environmental specimens rarely yielded C difficile pre- or post-reinforcement. Proper hand hygiene across all facilities did not change with reinforcement (pre 52.51%, post 52.18%), nor did antimicrobial use (pre 87–197 vs. post 84–245 antibiotic days per 1,000 resident-days). LTCFs found it challenging to maintain prolonged contact precautions.
Discussion
Variation in infection prevention and antimicrobial prescribing practices across LTCFs were identified and lessons learned.
Conclusions
Introducing bundled interventions in LTCFs is challenging, given the available resources, and may be more successful with fewer components and more intensive execution with feedback."

Methods
A standardized anonymous questionnaire was sent to all employees of the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland following the influenza season 2013/2014. We collected information regarding HCW's demographics, experiences with flu vaccinations, and reasons for nonvaccination.
Results
Vaccination rates ranged from 14.7% to 31% from 2007 to 2019. A total of 1,454 HCW participated in the survey, of which 62% reported being vaccinated. HCW not vaccinated were more commonly female and differed by occupational group and department. The main reasons for nonvaccination were fear of short-term adverse reactions, followed by assessing the evidence regarding vaccination-benefits as insufficient and fears of violation of the right to self-determination. Fear of long-term sequela and violation of the right of self-determination differed between the 4 professional groups, both being most commonly indicated by nurses and at least indicated by physicians.
Conclusions
This study provides some insight into differences regarding barriers to vaccination between different occupational groups, which might not have been adequately addressed so far. Policy makers should consider such differences when designing campaigns to raise acceptance of influenza vaccine among HCWs."

The objectives of this study were to assess the number of organisms present on different surfaces within a clinical environment before and after cleaning took place, and to identify the impact of cleaning. The study involved extensive 2-week microbiological environmental monitoring of an entire ward before and after cleaning; the ward was located within a pediatric hematology-oncology ward comprised of a day unit and outpatient ward.
Methods
Tryptone soya agar contact plates were used to take a total of 1,160 surface samples before and after cleaning from 55 predetermined sites. Samples were taken from representative surfaces throughout the ward representing a variety of materials, surface heights, functions, and distances from patients, as well as both high-touch and infrequently touched surfaces.
Results
After surface cleaning was undertaken within the ward, there was a significant difference between the amount of colony-forming units (CFUs) recovered before and after cleaning (P < .0001). Cleaning produced an average CFU reduction of 68% throughout the ward environment. The corridor was the most contaminated area within the ward. There were differences in the CFUs among the various areas within the ward, which were cleaned with varying efficiency. The surface material, who interacted with the surface, levels of initial contamination, perceived risk, and perceived cleanability were all found to have a varying impact on the cleaning effectiveness.
Conclusions
To the authors’ current knowledge, this is the only study to assess cleaning within a pediatric ward by taking samples directly before and after cleaning. The standard of cleaning undertaken within the ward is open for discussion, and these data highlight the need for an improved cleaning intervention and can provide insight into the multitude of factors that must be considered when designing an effective training protocol."

abstract = "Background
The financial burden health care–associated infections (HAIs) have on patients, payers, and hospitals is not clear. Although patient safety is the highest priority, administrators require data to justify the expense of HAI reduction programs.
Methods
Chart review was performed to identify HAIs for patients discharged from Stanford Hospital. Using a t test, we tested whether patients with an HAI will have a different daily total hospital cost and length of stay than patients without an HAI. We calculated the change in hospital profit related to HAIs by comparing patients with and without an HAI in the same admit All-Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Group and complexity score.
Results
Between October 1, 2015 and September 30, 2018, there were 78,551 inpatient discharges and 1,541 HAIs identified. Daily total hospital cost and length of stay for patients with an HAI versus patients without an HAI was $6,433 ($6,251, $6,615) versus $6,604 ($6,557, $6,651) (P = .073), and 26.30 days (24.89, 27.71) versus 5.69 (5.64, 5.74) (P < .001).
Discussion
For each HAI eliminated, data suggests that hospital's cost and revenue would increase $25,008 and $1,518,682, respectively, by backfilling beds with new patients at a 4.62:1 ratio. The reduction of HAIs is profitable for hospitals.
Conclusions
Data from this study suggest that the more HAIs you eliminate and the more capacity you build for the hospital, the higher the total hospital costs will go. This is an essential shift to the current paradigm that will allow for the accurate and continued funding of HAI reduction programs. Although hospital cost appears to increase as HAIs are reduced, hospital profits rise even more."

To evaluate risk factors for infection or colonization with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) to develop an algorithm for targeted CRE screening.
Methods
We conducted a case-control study of 50 CRE-positive cases and 100 CRE-negative controls to identify risk factors that were significant for CRE infection or colonization. The setting was at an acute care academic hospital. Patients who tested positive for CRE or other microbiological laboratory tests during the study period were included. We reviewed medical records of 50 patients who were CRE-positive and 100 matched controls who had a non-CRE culture at a similar anatomic site within the closest time period to the case's culture date. Risk factors were assessed using logistic regression with SAS 9.4, observing the 95% confidence interval (CI) to determine significance.
Results
Significant risk factors for CRE infection or colonization included the use of fluoroquinolones (odds ratio [OR], 3.75; 95% CI, 1.35, 10.38) and cephalosporins (OR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.17, 4.86). In addition, undergoing an invasive procedure with a scope device was also a significant risk factor for our participants (OR, 4.57; 95% CI, 1.31, 16.02). Significance of these risk factors varied within the community-acquired and hospital-acquired cases.
Conclusions
Our results suggest that exposure to certain antimicrobials and invasive procedures with a scope device (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, duodenal endoscope) are risk factors for CRE. The findings of significant differences in antimicrobials received highlight the necessity to understand antimicrobial stewardship in the development of CRE colonization and infection.

abstract = "Background
Surgical site infection (SSI) remains one of the most frequent complications in abdominal surgery, and hyperglycemia prevention is recommended as a measure to reduce this type of infection. The aims of this study were to estimate the incidence of SSI and to identify the effect of perioperative hyperglycemia on the incidence of this type of infection in patients undergoing abdominal surgery.
Methods
We enrolled 484 abdominal surgery patients ≥ 18 years of age, recruited between July 2016 and May 2017. Data were collected through structured interviews and patient assessments in the perioperative period and at the surgical outpatient clinic (30th day after surgery). Crude and adjusted models were built to identify the effect of hyperglycemia on SSI.
Results
The incidence rate of SSI was 20.25%. The attributable fraction for patients exposed to hyperglycemia was >60%. In the multivariable analysis, patients with hyperglycemia, at the end of the surgery and 12 hours later, were more likely to develop this type of infection (relative risk = 1.89 and 2.17, respectively).
Conclusions
Perioperative hyperglycemia was identified as an independent risk factor for SSI. The evidence generated reinforces the importance of proper glycemic control management in the perioperative period for the prevention of SSI."

We evaluated tuberculosis (TB) acquisition rate and risk factors among health care workers (HCWs) exposed to index TB patients.
Methods
We performed a retrospective cohort study on exposed HCWs from August 2016 to January 2018 at a tertiary hospital in Singapore. Demographic factors and TB exposure episodes per HCW were obtained. A modified Poisson regression model was used to identify factors associated with TB infection.
Results
A total of 32 TB exposure events occurred during the study period. A total of 881 HCWs with 1,536 exposure episodes were screened with QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-tube assay (QFT-GIT) at baseline and 8 weeks. A total of 129 (14.6%) HCWs had positive QFT-TB at baseline, whereas 22 (2.5%) HCWs had QFT-GIT conversion, with a latent TB infection (LTBI) rate of 1.14 cases per 100 exposure episodes per year. Foreign nationality, non-Chinese ethnicity, and age above 40 years were independently associated with baseline LTBI, whereas having >2 TB exposure episodes and working in internal medicine, medical subspecialties, and psychiatry wards were associated with QFT-GIT conversion.
Discussion
The QFT-GIT conversion rate among screened HCWs is low. Foreign HCWs with LTBI likely came from countries with higher TB transmission. Targeted prevention of repeated TB exposures can reduce QFT-GIT conversion.
Conclusions
The study results will guide TB contact tracing protocols in health care institutions."

abstract = "Background
Studies that examine the perceptions and behaviors of patients regarding patient hand hygiene rarely examine the viewpoint of patients about their hand hygiene behavior relative to current resources provided in the hospital.
Methods
Voluntary interviews that employed a 16-item survey tool were used among patients (N = 107) in outpatient clinics at post-admission visits. The survey was created using the Behavior Change Wheel, Capability, Opportunity, Motivation Behavior model. Patients were asked whether they brought hand sanitizer to the hospital, used hospital resources to clean their hands, and their perspective on patient hand hygiene importance compared with hospital staff, as well as their satisfaction or lack of satisfaction with hand hygiene independence.
Results
Most of the participants (65, 60.7%) reported that prior to being admitted to the hospital, they were able to maintain cleaning their hands with little or no difficulty. During their admission, only 21 (19.6%) of the participants reported needing little or no assistance. More than one-half of the participants, 34 (31.8%) and 23 (21.5%), respectively, reported, mostly or completely agreeing that the hand hygiene of the health care staff was more important than their own. Close to one-half of the participants (50, 46.7%) reported not being satisfied at all with their ability to maintain their hand hygiene in the hospital, whereas only 10 (9.3%) were very satisfied with their ability to maintain hand hygiene.

The use of antiseptic barrier caps reduced the occurrence of central line–associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) in adult intensive care settings. We assessed the effect of the use of antiseptic barrier caps on the incidence of CLABSI in infants and children and evaluated the implementation process.
Methods
We performed a mixed-method, prospective, observational before-after study. The CLABSI rate was documented during the “scrub the hub method” and the antiseptic barrier cap phase. Main outcomes were the number of CLABSIs per 1,000 catheter days (assessed with a Poisson regression analysis) and nurses’ adherence to antiseptic barrier cap protocol.
Results
In total, 2,248 patients were included. The rate of CLABSIs per 1,000 catheter days declined from 3.15 to 2.35, resulting in an overall incidence reduction of 22% (95% confidence interval, –34%, 55%; P = .368). Nurses’ adherence to the antiseptic barrier cap protocol was 95.2% and 89.0% for the neonatal intensive care unit and pediatric intensive care unit, respectively.
Discussion
The CLABSI reducing effect of the antiseptic barrier caps seems to be more prominent in the neonatal intensive care unit population compared with the pediatric intensive care unit population.

In 2014, 56 US hospitals were designated as Ebola treatment centers (ETCs). ETCs had minimum augmented capability requirements for Ebola virus disease care, including for staffing and training. We sought to identify current ETC staffing challenges and frequency of staff retraining.
Methods
In May 2019, an electronic survey was distributed to representatives of the 56 ETCs.
Results
Sixty-six percent (37/56) of ETCs responded. Registered nurses comprised the majority of ETC staff. All responding units required orientation training (average = 15.21 hours) and all but one required retraining. Among the top challenges that ETCs reported to maintaining high-level isolation capabilities were staff training time, staff recruitment, staff retention, and training costs.
Discussion
Five years after ETC designation, units face staffing challenges. Research is lacking on the effective number of hours and optimal frequency of staff training. ETCs reported smaller staffing teams compared to our 2016 assessment, but team composition remains similar. As units continue to maintain capabilities with decreasing external support and attention, the need for retraining must be balanced with logistical constraints and competing demands for staff time.
Conclusions
Our study shows that US preparedness capabilities are reduced. More research, support, and funding are needed to sustain the unique knowledge and proficiency acquired by ETC teams to ensure domestic preparedness for highly hazardous communicable diseases."

Some electronic hand hygiene (HH) monitoring systems require a benchmark of HH opportunities. To establish a benchmark, we measured rates of HH opportunities among general surgery patients at a tertiary care hospital.
Methods
Trained observers recorded HH opportunities for newly admitted patients daily for up to 5 days. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess the relationship between patient variables and the HH opportunity rate. A subset of observed HH events was compared to event data from an electronic HH monitoring system.
Results
We observed 2,404 HH opportunities over 677.4 care-hours for 23 patients (median 3.25 per hour; IQR 2.2-4.7, range 0-13). Rates of HH opportunities were significantly higher on admission day 1, for sessions starting before 9 AM, and for patients without roommates. HH was performed using alcohol-based hand rub from dispensers at the door to a patient's room more often than bedside or pocket dispensers (72.7% vs 20.8% or 5.1%). Electronic dispenser event counts did not match observed event counts.
Conclusions
Our results provide a benchmark HH opportunity rate for general surgery patients, and highlight the importance of validating electronic HH event counts. Further research is needed to determine which patient factors affect HH opportunity rates."

Current guidelines recommend perioperative warming as one of the strategies to prevent surgical site infection, although there are gaps in the knowledge produced on this issue.
Aim
Assess the efficacy of active warming methods to maintain perioperative patients’ body temperature and its effect on the occurrence of surgical site infection.
Methods
A systematic review with meta-analysis was carried out. PubMed, CINAHL, LiLACS, CENTRAL, and EMBASE databases were searched.
Findings
Of the 956 publications identified, 9 studies were selected for quantitative synthesis and 6 for the meta-analysis. The forced-air warming system was investigated in 8 studies. The generated evidence indicated that the use of an active warming method could maintain higher average body temperature as well as could decrease the surgical site infection incidence. Exposure of the patient to temperatures below 36°C in the perioperative period increased the chances of developing this type of infection. The meta-analysis indicated that the association between perioperative active warming methods compared with others to reduce the chances of developing surgical site infection remains unclear (odds ratio = e−3.59 = 2.718−0.59 = 0.552, 95% confidence interval (odds ratio) = (0.269-1.135), P = 0.106 I2 = 54.34%).
Conclusions
The employment of an active warming method is effective to maintain higher averages of body temperature. However, more randomized clinical trials are needed to assess the efficacy of that intervention to prevent surgical site infection."

The degree to which daily intensive care unit (ICU) cleaning practices impacts bacterial burden is controversial. The study aimed to assess the utility of using adenosine triphosphate (ATP) bioluminescence assays for monitoring effectiveness of daily cleaning in ICU environments.
Methods
We sampled 364 total samples from 57 patient rooms and 18 common areas in 3 medical ICUs over 12 weeks, before and after routine daily cleaning. Endpoints were ATP levels (relative light units, RLU) and bacterial bioburden (colony forming units, CFU).
Results
High-touch surfaces in ICU patient rooms and common areas were contaminated before and after cleaning. Routine cleaning significantly reduced bacterial burden in patient rooms (0.14 log10 CFU reduction, P = .008; 0.21 log10 RLU reduction, P < .001) and in ICU common areas (1.18 log10 CFU reduction, P < .001; 0.72 log10 RLU reduction, P < .001). Among sites with colony counts >20 CFUs, the proportion of sites with ATP readings >250 RLU was significantly higher than those with ATP readings ≤250 RLU (90.0% vs 10.0%, P < .05).
Conclusion
Routine cleaning significantly reduced bacterial burden on ICU environment surfaces. Although not an alternative to culture methods, ATP assays may be a useful technique to provide rapid feedback on surface cleanliness in ICU settings."

This study investigated cesarean delivery surgical site infection (SSI) rates before and after implementation of a SSI care bundle.
Methods
A SSI bundle for cesareans was introduced in our hospital in April 2014 to reduce the SSI rate. The practices were divided into bundle elements that reflected preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to evaluate implementation of the SSI care bundle. Women were included if they had a gestational age of at least 23 0/7 weeks and delivered a liveborn neonate(s) between 2012 and 2015. They were then divided into 2 study groups: pre-bundle and post-bundle. The primary study outcome was SSI rate. Secondary outcomes included comorbidities, perioperative factors, and SSI classification.
Results
The overall incidence of cesarean SSIs during the study time period was 1.89 (76 SSIs in 4014 cesarean deliveries). The pre-bundle mean was 2.44 and decreased to 1.1 following implementation of the SSI bundle (P = .013). This represents a 221% reduction in the SSI rate. Patient demographics and pre-existing medical conditions were similar pre- and post-bundle. Compliance with bundle elements was high.

To evaluate the effects of a best practice advisory (BPA) and a change in the Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile testing algorithm on nosocomial C. difficile infection (CDI) rates.
Methods
This was a retrospective analysis at a tertiary care hospital of adult patients who tested positive for CDI between July 1, 2017 and September 30, 2019. In June 2018, we implemented a BPA in our electronic health record recommending against testing for CDI in patients receiving laxatives. We reviewed the number of C. difficile tests ordered before and after initiating the BPA. In December 2018, we replaced nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) with a cell cytotoxicity assay (CCA) for stool specimens that were enzyme immunoassay toxin negative and glutamate dehydrogenase positive.
Results
The number of C. difficile tests ordered per month decreased 14% after implementing the BPA (P = .0001). Following this intervention, the rate of nosocomial CDI (nCDI) decreased by 16.5% (P = .33). Following substitution of CCA for NAAT for enzyme immunoassay toxin−/glutamate dehydrogenase+ specimens, there was a 50% reduction in the rate of nCDI (7.1 cases/10,000 patient days to 3.5 cases/10,000 patient days; P < .0001).
Conclusions
Implementing a BPA to reduce inappropriate testing and changing the testing algorithm for C. difficile by substituting CCA for NAAT resulted in a lower rate of diagnosis of nCDI."

Stethoscope hygiene is rarely done despite guideline recommendations. We wanted to determine whether demonstrating what is growing on the stethoscopes of providers via culture or bioluminescence technology alters perceptions and improves compliance.
Methods
Providers were given the opportunity to (1) culture their stethoscopes before and after disinfection with alcohol pads, alcohol-based hand rub, or hydrogen peroxide disinfectant wipes and (2) swab stethoscopes for bioluminescence-based adenosine triphosphate testing before and after disinfection. Outcomes were observed for hand and stethoscope hygiene rates and before and after intervention survey responses. The bacteria that were isolated, colony-forming units (CFU), and bioluminescence scores were tracked.
Results
A total of 1,245 observed hand hygiene opportunities showed that compliance improved from 72.5%-82.3% (P < .001). In addition, 590 observed patient-provider encounters revealed no significant change in stethoscope hygiene rates of 10% initially and 5% afterward (P = .08), although self-reported rates trended from 56%- 67% postintervention (P = .06). Perceptions regarding stethoscope hygiene importance improved (8.5/10 to 9.3/10; P = .04).

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly, bringing pressure and challenges to nursing staff.
Objective
To explore the psychology of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients.
Methods
Using a phenomenological approach, we enrolled 20 nurses who provided care for COVID-19 patients in the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Science and Technology from January 20, to February 10, 2020. The interviews were conducted face-to-face or by telephone and were analysed by Colaizzi's 7-step method.
Results
The psychological experience of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients can be summarized into 4 themes. First, negative emotions present in early stage consisting of fatigue, discomfort, and helplessness was caused by high-intensity work, fear and anxiety, and concern for patients and family members. Second, self-coping styles included psychological and life adjustment, altruistic acts, team support, and rational cognition. Third, we found growth under pressure, which included increased affection and gratefulness, development of professional responsibility, and self-reflection. Finally, we showed that positive emotions occurred simultaneously with negative emotions.
Conclusions
During an epidemic outbreak, positive and negative emotions of the front-line nurses interweaved and coexisted. In the early stage, negative emotions were dominant and positive emotions appeared gradually. Self-coping styles and psychological growth played an important role in maintaining mental health of nurses."

abstract = "Purpose
To identify and characterize studies evaluating clinician compliance with infection-related guidelines, and to explore trends in guideline design and implementation strategies.
Data sources
PubMed database, April 2017. Followed the PRISMA Statement for systematic reviews.
Study selection
Scope was limited to studies reporting compliance with guidelines pertaining to the prevention, detection, and/or treatment of acute hospital-based infections. Initial search (1,499 titles) was reduced to 49 selected articles.
Data extraction
Extracted publication and guideline characteristics, outcome measures reported, and any results related to clinician compliance. Primary summary measures were frequencies and distributions of characteristics. Interventions that led to improved compliance results were analyzed to identify trends in guideline design and implementation.
Results of data synthesis
Of the 49 selected studies, 18 (37%), 13 (27%), and 10 (20%) focused on sepsis, pneumonia, and general infection, respectively. Six (12%), 17 (35%), and 26 (53%) studies assessed local, national, and international guidelines, respectively. Twenty studies (41%) reported 1-instance compliance results, 28 studies (57%) reported 2-instance compliance results (either before-and-after studies or control group studies), and 1 study (2%) described compliance qualitatively. Average absolute change in compliance for minimal, decision support, and multimodal interventions was 10%, 14%, and 25%, respectively. Twelve studies (24%) reported no patient outcome alongside compliance.
Conclusions
Multimodal interventions and quality improvement initiatives seem to produce the greatest improvement in compliance, but trends in other factors were inconsistent. Additional research is required to investigate these relationships and understand the implications behind various approaches to guideline design, communication, and implementation, in addition to effectiveness of protocol impact on relevant patient outcomes."

abstract = "Background
Service providers are often inadequately compliant with standard precaution protocols. This study used bottleneck analysis to identify the weakest link in standard precaution implementation and its associated challenges in hospitals.
Methods
Bottleneck analysis was conducted in 12 hospitals in Fujian Province, China. In each hospital, a focus group was organized among the key informants to illustrate the sequential steps of standard precaution implementation graphically. The level of difficulty and the specific challenges associated with each step were discussed.
Results
The sequential activities of standard precaution implementation generally start with making budget for personal protection equipment (PPE), followed by procurement, storage/inventory, in-hospital distribution, in-department distribution, usage/monitoring, and recycling of PPE. Service providers’ improper use of PPE was the primary bottleneck. The reasons for improper use of PPE included high workload, time constraints, the sense of wearing PPE would interfere with clinical judgment, and various misconceptions. Making financial planning, recycling, and procurement of PPE were the secondary bottlenecks.
Conclusions
Bottleneck analysis is useful to illustrate workflow in healthcare systems and pinpoint constraints in standard precaution implementation. Institutional changes, including targeted provider training, adjustment of providers’ workloads, and allocation of budget, are suggested strategies to address the identified bottlenecks in standard precaution."

abstract = "Background
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services requires that health care facilities assess their building water systems and minimize the risk of growth and spread of Legionella and other waterborne pathogens. Increasingly, point-of-use (POU) filters are being used to prevent exposure to these pathogens. This study provides efficacy and performance specifications (membrane size, pore size, and use restrictions), which will aid in selecting POU filters.
Methods
New faucet and shower filters rated for 62 days of use were evaluated at an acute care facility in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. Five faucets and 5 showers served as controls or were equipped with filters. Hot water samples were collected weekly for 12 weeks and cultured for Legionella, heterotrophic plate count, and Pseudomonas. Literature searches for articles on POU filters used in health care settings were performed using PubMed and Google Scholar. Filter specifications from 5 manufacturers were also compared.
Results
The 62-day POU filters installed on both faucets and showers eliminated Legionella and reduced heterotrophic plate count concentrations for 12 weeks. No Pseudomonas was recovered during this study. Twenty peer-reviewed studies are summarized, and 21 features of 53 POU filters have been compiled.
Conclusions
The information provides infection preventionists and facility engineers with information to verify claims from manufacturers and compare differences among POU products, including validated efficacy, filter design, and operational specifications."

We aimed to characterize the epidemiology, identify risk factors, and measure outcomes of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infections among hospitalized patients.
Methods
We performed a retrospective study of hospitalized patients with CRE infection using records from the US military health system database. Cases included patients admitted for ≥2 days from 2008-2015, with a clinical culture growing any Enterobacteriaceae reported as resistant to a carbapenem. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify comorbid conditions and procedures associated with CRE infection, and a high-dimensional propensity score was used for a case-mix adjusted evaluation of CRE-associated in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and hospitalization costs.
Results
From 1,162,686 hospitalized patients, we identified 143 with CRE infection over the 7-year study period. Conditions associated with CRE infection included manipulation of the gastrointestinal tract, musculoskeletal trauma, orthopedic procedures, septicemia, and both recent and remote exposure to broad-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics. Patients hospitalized with CRE infection had significantly higher hospitalization costs (attributable difference, $206,664; P < .001), longer hospital stays (attributable difference, 28.8 days; P < .001), and increased odds of in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 3.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.82-6.12).
Conclusions
CRE are a significant threat to hospitalized patients. Our study quantifies the health care burden associated with CRE infection in the inpatient setting and highlights the importance of initiatives aimed at curbing the spread of these costly infections."

Many health care workers are using smartphones and wearable devices without an enforced cleaning standard to prevent the spread of bacteria to patients. To our knowledge, no real-world trials have been performed to date, examining bacterial elimination on these devices in a hospital setting. The primary objective was to determine if ultraviolet wavelength C (UV-C) was more effective at eliminating bacteria on smartphones and wearable devices when compared with usual care.
Methods
This prospective before-and-after study included clinicians who used smartphones or wearable devices during their daily clinical practice. Devices underwent two 30-second UV-C disinfection cycles, at the beginning and end of clinician shifts. Swabs were collected at predetermined intervals both prior to and following a UV-C disinfection cycle to determine the extent of bacterial growth.
Results
Following a run-in period of twice-daily UV-C disinfection, 20% of devices grew pathogenic bacteria prior to UV-C use. Comparatively, only 4% of devices grew bacteria post-UV-C; therefore, the decrease in bacterial growth was statistically significant (P = .002).
Conclusions
UV-C appears to be more effective at eliminating bacteria on smartphones and wearable devices when compared with usual care and is a useful disinfection device in a hospital setting. Further studies are needed to determine the interval at which UV-C should be used to prevent bacterial growth and spread."

A penicillin allergy label has been associated with significantly higher rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) colonization, and correspondingly poorer clinical outcomes. However, there are limited data examining the association between any antibiotic label and colonization rates. We sought to evaluate if there is a relationship between patients with an antibiotic allergy label and prevalence of MRSA or VRE colonization.
Methods
We retrospectively reviewed all patients with an MRSA surveillance culture between December 15, 2014 and January 31, 2015, or a VRE surveillance culture between January 1, 2013 and January 31, 2015, at a tertiary community-based teaching hospital. Our primary objective was to evaluate the prevalence of MRSA or VRE colonization among patients with and without antibiotic allergies. Bivariate analyses included the χ² test and the Student t test to determine statistical significance for categorical and continuous variables, respectively.
Results
We included a total of 1,053 unique patients screened for MRSA, and 290 unique patients screened for VRE. The rate of MRSA and VRE colonization was 5.8% (62 of 1,053) and 32.4% (94 of 290), respectively, in our cohort. Antibiotic allergies were documented in approximately 1 out of 3 patients, 337 (32%) for the MRSA group and 94 (32%) for VRE group. There was a significant difference in MRSA colonization between patients with and without an antibiotic allergy, 28 of 337 (8.3%) versus 34 of 716 (4.7%) (P = .025), respectively. In contrast, there was no significant difference in antibiotic allergy rates with and without VRE colonization, 34 of 94 (36.2%) versus 92 of 196 (46.9%) (P = .10), respectively.
Conclusions
An antibiotic allergy label was associated with significantly higher rates of MRSA colonization but no statistical difference with VRE colonization."

The objective of this study was to understand how aged care home health professionals perceive antimicrobial use near the end of life and how they perceive potential antimicrobial stewardship activities near the end of life in aged care homes.
Methods
Qualitative semi-structured interviews were undertaken with general practitioners, nurses, and pharmacists who provide routine care in aged care homes in Victoria, Australia. Interviews were coded using frameworks for understanding behavior change.
Results
Themes were established within 14 interviews, and an additional 6 interviews were undertaken to ensure thematic saturation. Two major themes emerged: (i) Antimicrobial stewardship activities near the end of life in aged care homes need to enable aged care home nurses to make decisions substantiated by evidence-based clinical knowledge. Antimicrobial stewardship should clearly be part of an aged care home nurse's role, and accreditation standards provide powerful motivation for behavior change. (ii) Antimicrobial stewardship activities near the end of life in aged care homes must address family confidence in resident wellbeing. Antimicrobial stewardship activities should be inclusive of family involvement, and messages should highlight the point that antimicrobial stewardship improves care.
Conclusions
Antimicrobial stewardship activities that reinforce evidence-based clinical decision-making by aged care home nurses and address family confidence in resident wellbeing are required near the end of life in aged care homes. Accreditation standards are important motivators for behavior change in aged care homes."

Infection control is a cornerstone of post-heart transplantation (HTx) in-hospital management when immunosuppression is highest. The use of protective isolation persists despite its questionable effectiveness. We describe and compare practice patterns internationally and assessed correlates of protective isolation.
Methods
Using the BRIGHT-study data, a cross-sectional intercontinental study, we assessed 12 protective isolation measures in 4 continents, 11 countries, and 36 HTx centers. Data were summarized descriptively, as appropriate. Comparisons between countries and continents and association testing between center characteristics and number of isolation measures used were also explored by general linear modeling.
Results
A total of 89% (32/36) of HTx centers used protective isolation measures with an average of 4.5 protective isolation measures per center (SD, 2.6; range 1-10). Most often applied were disinfecting high-touch surfaces (n = 27/34; 79.4%), use of private room (n = 27/36; 75.0%), and changing linen daily (n = 25/36; 69.4%). Least applied were wearing a cap (n = 6/35; 17.1%) and high-efficiency particulate air filtration (N = 5/32; 15.6 %). Larger centers and those with dedicated beds for HTx applied more isolation measures.
Conclusions
Protective isolation measures are still widely applied within heart transplant centers across the world persists notwithstanding its doubtful effectiveness. Future clinical guidelines for heart transplant management should include a statement of the need for strict adherence to standard infection prevention measures."

Methods
We conducted a before-and-after trial in a private tertiary care hospital. The pre-intervention cohort (n = 16) included all patients who had undergone kidney transplant (KT) during the outbreak (June 2010-April 2011), and the post-intervention cohort (n = 49) included all patients who had undergone KT between May 2011 and October 2013. From May 2011, only bandages sterilized by the centralized sterile services department were used to fix wound dressings of KT patients.
Results
Differences in age (50.2 years vs 51.3 years), sex (43.8% male vs 59.2% female), weight (63.3 kg vs 69.7 kg), hemodialysis vintage (55.6 months vs 47.8 months), and other risk factors were not observed between the pre- and post-intervention cohorts, respectively.

Alcohol based hand rubs (ABHR) are extremely effective at reducing microbial contamination and have an essential role in best practice hand hygiene described by the World Health Organization.
Methods
We determined ABHR drying time when performing hand hygiene in a laboratory setting. Which was followed by identifying the amount of ABHR needed for complete hand coverage. When the aforementioned was analyzed real-time data were gathered to examine the amount used for hand hygiene in a hospital setting. In parallel hands of healthcare workers (HCWs) were monitored for drying time and perception on ABHR use.
Results
In 86% (24,446,397/28,280,383) of the events a single dose of ABHR was used on clinical wards. Twenty-four HCWs expected hand hygiene to take 7.5 seconds (median; range 3-30 seconds). Forty-three HCWs show that 1.5 mL ABHR dose achieves the desired drying time according to World Health Organization guidelines (av. median 26 seconds), but is consistently perceived to have a longer drying time than expected (av. median 18 seconds). In-vivo results (n = 10) indicate that 2.25 mL ABHR is required for adequate coverage (82%-90%) of both sides of the hand.
Conclusions
Results indicate that set standards for the use of ABHR do not match “in-vivo” behaviour of HCWs. Perceived drying times are shorter than actual drying time. The needed drying time to reach acceptable antimicrobial efficacy of ABHRs should be revisited."

Methods
This retrospective study included 355 patients hospitalized over a 2-year period. Patient characteristics, antimicrobial resistance patterns, and risk factors of acquisition and predictors of mortality in patients who had a HAI were examined.
Results
HAIs were diagnosed in 32.7% of patients. Resistance rates > 50% were observed in all antimicrobials except for tigecycline (14%), colistin (9%), and linezolid (0%). Predictors of HAI acquisition were underlying viral CNS infections and invasive devices—urinary and central venous catheters, and nasogastric tubes. Diabetes mellitus and intubation (odds ratio 2.5 and 6.7, P = .042 and <.001) were identified as predictors for increased mortality in patients who had a HAI.

The active immunization of health care workers (HCWs) is a primary measure to prevent nosocomial infection; despite this, vaccine coverage among HCWs in most countries is low. To increase vaccine coverage in the health care setting, the hygiene and occupational medicine departments of Bari Policlinico General University-Hospital implemented a vaccination procedure. This operative procedure requires that during the occupational medical examination, all employees are evaluated for immunity/susceptibility to vaccine-preventable diseases, with vaccination offered to those determined to be susceptible.
Methods
The study sample comprised HCWs who attended the biological risk assessment program from December 2017 to January 2019 (n = 449).
Results
Susceptibility was higher for hepatitis B virus (23%), followed by rubella (11%), varicella (9%), mumps (8%), and measles (7%). The seroconversion rate after the administration of booster dose(s) was >80% for all vaccines. Overall, 15% of the HCWs refused the offered vaccine(s), and the main determinants of vaccination compliance were younger age (P < .0001) and being a physician (P < .05).

Staffing ratios based on hospital beds and norms do not adequately address the requirement of infection preventionists (IP) in hospitals. We, therefore, aimed to determine staffing of IP (nursing category) based on actual workload involved.
Methods
The study design was quantitative and longitudinal conducted for 1 year. The study was structured around the steps of the World Health Organization's Workload Indicators of Staffing Need (WISN).
Results
We identified infection control activities, support activities and additional activities to be performed by 4 IP with a total available working time of 6,132 hours for an annual workload of 6,238.25 (±372) hours in an acute care hospital with 182 beds and 69,331 annual admissions. Core infection control activities consumed 78% time. Support and additional activities consumed the remaining 22% time. Active surveillance required 44% time and education consumed 32% time. WISN ratio of available staff and required staff was 0.75.
Discussion
A WISN ratio less than 1 suggests inadequate staffing. Therefore, the WISN method recommends 4 IP instead of 3 based on existing workload. We compared our results with the existing quantification-based staffing studies.
Conclusions
WISN is a valuable method to measure all infection control activities and translate workload into IP (nursing) full time equivalents."

Patients with measles can precipitate outbreaks in health care facilities where they seek care. Rural critical-access hospitals (CAHs) may be at higher risk of outbreaks given their size and potentially limited infection prevention resources.
Methods
We surveyed CAHs in Idaho to ascertain their levels of preparedness for managing measles cases. A 25-item questionnaire was sent to infection preventionists at all 27 Idaho CAHs. The questionnaire covered organizational structure, resources for managing measles cases, and hospital policies for ensuring immunity among health care workers.
Results
A total of 22 (82%) CAHs responded, reporting varying availability of facilities and resources for managing measles cases and disparate procedures for testing clinical samples and providing vaccines to nonimmune, exposed staff.
Discussion
With measles incidence on the rise in the United States, our survey found that most of the responding hospitals had the basic organizational structure for facility-wide prevention and management efforts in case a patient with suspected or confirmed measles presented to that facility. Most of the hospitals also had at least some available resources to manage measles cases, as well as policies for ensuring immunity to measles among at least some groups of health care workers.
Conclusions
This study provides initial perspectives on measles preparedness among Idaho CAHs, despite limited generalizability. Future studies should explore whether self-reported preparedness measures reflect the ability of the CAHs to control measles spread when cases present for care."

abstract = "Background
The infection risk scan (IRIS) is a tool to measure the quality of infection control (IC) and antimicrobial use in a standardized way. We describe the feasilibility of the IRIS in a Dutch hospital (the Netherlands, NL) and a hospital in the United States (US).
Methods
Cross-sectional measurements were performed. Variables included a hand hygiene indicator, environmental contamination, IC preconditions, personal hygiene of health care workers, use of indwelling medical devices, and use of antimicrobials.
Results
IRIS was performed in 2 wards in a US hospital and 4 wards in a Dutch hospital. Unjustified use of medical devices: none in the US hospital, 2.2% in the Dutch hospital; inappropriate use of antibiotics: 11.7% (US), 19% (NL); items considered not clean: 10% (US); 36% (NL); shortcomings preconditions: 6 of 20 (US), 6 of 40 (NL); health care workers with rings, watches, or long sleeves: 34 of 43 (US), none in the NL hospital; and hand hygiene actions per patient/day: 41 (US) and 10 (NL). US data judged against the Dutch guidelines and vice versa revealed remarkable differences.
Conclusions
We showed the feasibility of using the IRIS in a US hospital. The method provided insight in IC local performance. This method could be the first step to standardize the measurement of the quality of IC and antimicrobial use. However, if the IRIS is used for benchmarking between hospitals in different regions, this should be done in the context of regional guidelines and policies."

abstract = "Background
In September 2016, the Korean National Health Insurance Service began reimbursing infection control (IC) costs on the condition that a certain number of doctors and full-time nurses for IC be allocated to supported hospitals. We analyzed the impact of the IC cost reimbursement policy on central line–associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs).
Methods
A before-and-after study that analyzed the CLABSI rate trends between preintervention (January 2016 to February 2017) and intervention (March to December 2017) periods using autoregression time series analysis was performed in intensive care units (ICUs) at a 750-bed, secondary care hospital in Daegu, Republic of Korea. The enhanced IC team visited ICUs daily, monitored the implementation of CLABSI prevention bundles, and educated all personnel involved in catheter insertion and maintenance from March 2017.
Results
Autoregressive analysis revealed that the CLABSI rates per month in the preintervention and intervention periods were −0.256 (95% confidence interval, −0.613 to 0.101; P = .15) and −0.602 (95% confidence interval, −0.972 to −0.232; P = .008), respectively. The rates of compliance with maximal barrier precautions significantly improved from the preintervention (36.2%) to the intervention (77.9%) period (χ² test, P < .001).
Conclusions
The IC cost reimbursement policy accelerated the decline in CLABSI rates significantly in monitored ICUs. A nationwide study to evaluate the effectiveness of the IC cost reimbursement policy for various health care–associated infections is warranted."

The epidemiology of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) and local dominant etiologies of pathogens that cause respiratory tract infections (RTIs) among central China children (≤14 years old) hospitalized are poorly understood.
Methods
A total of 10,429 specimens were analyzed, and IgM antibodies against 9 respiratory pathogens including MP were detected using indirect immunofluorescence assay from serum.
Results
It showed that 59.3% of the enrolled children were positive for at least 1 pathogen; highest detection rates included those between 3 and <6 years of age (70.4%), female (63.2%), and who were hospitalized in 2014 (80.9%). The most predominant pathogen was MP (45.6%), followed by Parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) (22.6%) and influenza B viruses (IFVB) (14.7%). Coinfection was observed in 2,907 specimens (27.9%); the coinfection combination containing MP and PIVs had the highest detection rate of 15%, followed by MP and IFVB as well as IFVB and PIVs.
Conclusions
MP was the most commonly detected bacteria among hospitalized children, which should be included in the differential diagnosis for hospitalized children with RTI. These findings will contribute to the effective prevention and therapeutic approaches of pathogens among local children suffering from RTI."

This non-randomized comparative observational study evaluated the performance of a standard manual-chemical disinfection process with an automated process employing focused multivector ultraviolet (FMUV) light technology during operating room (OR) terminal cleaning.
Methods
An Association of periOperative Registered Nurses terminal cleaning protocol was modified to incorporate the use of automated FMUV technology that allows workers to occupy the room during operation. This modified protocol was compared with a standard manual-chemical cleaning and disinfection protocol. Equipment surfaces were pre-sampled before and after terminal cleaning. A total of 165 objects were sampled in each process using a 5-point multisided sampling method.
Results
The parallel process employing FMUV reduced the active microbial burden by 96.5% from baseline (P < .0001), which was over 2.5 times better than the standard process. The standard terminal manual-chemical disinfection process reduced the active microbial burden on sampled objects by 38.4% from baseline (P < .0001).
Conclusions
The data demonstrates that the performance of standard manual-chemical disinfection alone is variable in a live clinical setting even under the most ideal conditions. By comparison, automated FMUV treatment incorporated in a parallel process consistently produced thorough and significant reductions of microbial contamination levels on all visibly clean patient care equipment."

In this study, we explored the role of colonization in health care workers (HCWs) in transmission of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) to neonates at a level IV neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
Methods
All available screening and clinical MSSA isolates, from the period March 2015 through April 2016, isolated from HCWs and neonates at the level IV NICU, were included. MSSA isolates were initially genotyped using spa typing, and for the most prevalent spa types, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed.
Results
From March 2015 through April 2016, 159 neonates and 115 HCWs were found positive for MSSA, and all isolates were typed by means of spa typing. Twenty-three spa types were found in both HCWs and neonates. Within the most prevalent spa types (t002, t015 and t2787), 4 WGS clusters of genetically indistinguishable MSSA isolates were found in which 4 HCWs and 35 neonates were involved. A total of 10 neonates included in the 4 WGS clusters suffered from bacteremia.
Conclusions
We showed that HCWs carried the same MSSA isolates as those found in neonates, and that HCWs might serve as a reservoir for transmission of MSSA to neonates. Ten neonates suffered from a bacteremia caused by a MSSA previously detected in a HCW."

Clinical guidelines support early discontinuation of antimicrobials after cardiac device procedures; however, prolonged courses of antimicrobials are common.
Methods
We conducted semistructured interviews with 13 electrophysiologists representing diverse geographic and clinical settings of care to identify perceived barriers and facilitators to discontinuing postprocedure antimicrobial prophylaxis as part of a formative evaluation prior to implementing a program to improve uptake of guideline recommendations. A directed content analysis approach was used to map responses to the Implementation Outcomes Framework.
Results
Data indicated that electrophysiologists were not willing to stop postprocedural antimicrobials, indicating a lack of acceptability of clinical guidelines. Feasibility, fidelity, cost, and appropriateness were also frequently cited. Factors associated with prolonged antimicrobial prescribing included beliefs about lack of harm and possible benefit. There was a strong “cultural inertia” to conform to institutional normative practices. Reasons for conforming ranged from streamlining processes for clinical staff and concerns about being perceived as an “outlier.”
Conclusions
Institutional culture and beliefs about consequences of cardiac device infections versus antimicrobial use appeared to be major drivers of current practice. The desire to promote institutional standardization suggests that strategies to enhance implementation of prophylaxis guidelines must include facility-level changes, rather than interventions directed only at individual-providers."

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common. Outpatient antimicrobial stewardship programs are emerging and a focused approach to UTIs is needed to help guide programs.
Methods
Data were collected by retrospective chart review of outpatients using encounters from January 2005 to March 2018. Antibiotic therapy was indicated if at least one UTI symptom was present. Antibiotic therapy was appropriate if consistent with guidelines and culture results. Factors that differed significantly (P <.05) between the comparator groups were built into a multivariable logistic regression model to determine factors associated with inappropriate prescribing.
Results
A total of 607 outpatients were included, of which approximately 68% were treated inappropriately. Inappropriate regimens consisted of 50.9% (n = 309) incorrect durations, 35.1% (n = 213) incorrect choice of antibiotic, and 12.4% (n = 75) incorrect doses. Ten percent of patients developed a reinfection within 30 days. Recurrence of UTI with the same pathogen within 30 days occurred in 5.1%. Catheter use and advanced age are both risk factors for recurrence and inappropriate treatment.
Conclusions
Outpatient antibiotic prescribing for UTIs is suboptimal. Stewardship programs should focus on patients with catheters and of advanced age as they are often inappropriately treated."

Health care–associated infections (HAIs) are a global health burden because of their significant impact on patient health and health care systems. Mechanistic simulation modeling that captures the dynamics between patients, pathogens, and the environment is increasingly being used to improve understanding of epidemiological patterns of HAIs and to facilitate decisions on infection prevention and control (IPC). The purpose of this review is to present a systematic review to establish (1) how simulation models have been used to investigate HAIs and their mitigation and (2) how these models have evolved over time, as well as identify (3) gaps in their adoption and (4) useful directions for their future development.
Methods
The review involved a systematic search and identification of studies using system dynamics, discrete event simulation, and agent-based model to study HAIs.
Results
The complexity of simulation models developed for HAIs significantly increased but heavily concentrated on transmission dynamics of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the hospitals of high-income countries. Neither HAIs in other health care settings, the influence of contact networks within a health care facility, nor patient sharing and referring networks across health care settings were sufficiently understood.
Conclusions
This systematic review provides a broader overview of existing simulation models in HAIs to identify the gaps and to direct and facilitate further development of appropriate models in this emerging field."

Bacterial transmission within and between successive surgical cases occurs in operating rooms (ORs), often includes anesthesia equipment as a reservoir, and can be monitored by collecting samples and identifying bacteria by genetic testing. We evaluated how to choose cases for active surveillance to quantify the effectiveness of interventions in 2 groups of ORs (eg, rooms with germicidal lighting vs those without).
Methods
Data were from a 7 OR single-specialty gastrointestinal endoscopy suite and from a typical 8 OR multispecialty surgical suite.
Results
At the multispecialty hospital, 40.3% (SE 1.2%) of the total number of cases could be used for surveillance (ie, followed by another case of the same specialty and matched with a corresponding pair of cases from the other OR group). Random selection obtained fewer matched pairs than deliberate selection: mean ratio of random/deliberate = 0.64 (0.01) for the single-specialty and 0.51 (0.02) for the multispecialty suite (P <.001).
Conclusions
The efficiency of sampling to obtain pairs of successive surgical cases of the same specialty is impaired markedly by randomly selecting pairs of cases (or using convenience sampling) as compared to choosing pairs deliberately. This is important because the number of cases that can be suitably used for surveillance of bacterial transmission will typically be less than one-half the total case number."

The use of chlorhexidine as a strategy to reduce nosocomial infections in patients has been proven useful. Bacterial contamination of health care worker's uniforms during routine patient care has been demonstrated to have potential for horizontal transmission of pathogens.
Methods
We performed a prospective, open comparative trial. We included nurses who were in direct patient care and evaluated clothing microbial growth during 3 interventions: (1) participants were given a sterile surgical scrub (SSS) to put on the beginning of the shift, (2) they were instructed to take a chlorhexidine bath (CHG-B) before putting on the SSS, and (3) participants were given a chlorhexidine impregnated SSS (CI-SSS). Cultures were obtained from 3 areas (chest pocket, chest, and abdominal) at hour 0, 6, and 12 hours after the start of the shift.
Results
A total of 306 cultures processed with 17 bacterial groups. The uniform area with the highest number of CFU was the abdomen (818 CFU), followed by the thorax (654 CFU). Over 50% of the bacterial load occurred at 12 hours (1,092 CFU at 12 hours, 766 CFU at 6 hours, and 184 CFU at 0 hour). There was a significant reduction in CFU when SSS was compared to CHG-B (CFU mean = 12.5 [0-118] vs CFU mean = 3.5 [0-22], P = .003); and SSS versus CI-SSS (CFU mean = 12.5 [0-118] vs CFU mean = 3 [0-39], P = .007).

Our hospital has several characteristics different from the settings in which the central venous catheter (CVC) care bundle has been implemented so far, that is, care bundles or protocols are not systematically used, and the prevalence of central line–associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) is high, as is bed occupancy rate. We examined the effectiveness of CVC care bundles.
Methods
Modified CVC bundles were implemented across all settings of our hospital. During both phases of the study, we collected data on CLABSI, and we monitored CVC insertion and management practices with direct observation audits.
Results
We have studied 913 CVC insertions (454 in PRE and 459 in POST) for 11,871 catheter-days. The incidence of CLABSI was 8.3 per 1,000 catheter-days PRE, and 7.6 per 1,000 catheter-days POST (incidence rate ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-1.40). Compliance with the CVC insertion bundle increased from 8.4%-74.3% (P < .0001). The CVC management bundle compliance also increased from 11.4%-57.7% (P < .0001).
Conclusions
Despite improved compliance after the intervention, implementation of a modified CVC bundle failed to decrease CLABSI incidence. Higher bundle compliance rates may be necessary for a significant decrease in the incidence of CLABSI, along with the appropriate organizational culture and levels of staffing."

Decreasing immunization rates may be partly due to antivaccine campaigns and other sources of misinformation available on social media, particularly on Facebook. Given the potential impact of this medium for communicating vaccine-related information, it is important to analyze the trend of information available on Facebook.
Methods
We searched Facebook on August 15, 2018 to obtain posts containing relevant health information on influenza vaccine in years 2015-2018. We collected information regarding nature of the post (eg, pro-, antivaccine, and informational), number of shares and likes received, and ease of reading for each post. We evaluated these characteristics by year and type of post in our exploratory analyses.
Results
The proportion of pro-vaccine posts has increased compared to antivaccine and informational posts since 2016. There was no correlation between ease of reading and popularity of posts. Although the language of antivaccine posts was complex, they were shared and liked more than pro-vaccine posts. The pro-vaccine personal post by a nurse was the most popular in our study (shared over 46,000 times) in 2018.
Conclusions
Though the number of pro-vaccine posts increased, antivaccine posts remained more popular. The government agency may use an emotive personal family-oriented message to promote vaccination."

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is one of the most common health care–associated infections. This study assessed the validity of a laboratory-based surveillance method as compared with a traditional, clinical surveillance method to identify hospital-acquired CDIs.
Methods
Retrospective analysis of positive C difficile laboratory records between April 2015 and March 2017 were compared with a clinical dataset of positive inpatient C difficile cases for all acute care facilities in Alberta, Canada. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated using STATA/IC 13.0.
Results
The laboratory surveillance method had a sensitivity of 96.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 95.7%-97.3%) and a specificity of 65.7% (95% CI, 63.6%-67.8%); positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 74.3% (95% CI, 73.2%-75.5%) and 94.9% (95% CI, 93.7%-95.9%), respectively.
Discussion
To date, the breadth of research on alternate CDI surveillance systems has focused on the use of International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 9th and 10th Revision coding mechanisms. Our results expand on the published literature, as a laboratory approach may provide more timely information, with a smaller amount of misclassified cases.
Conclusions
Using a laboratory surveillance method to capture hospital-acquired CDI cases is highly sensitive but not overly specific. Changes to improve the specificity of this method are provided."

Previous studies have drawn different conclusions about the impact of Candida airway colonization on clinical outcomes in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
Methods
We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase (via OVID), and Web of Science database. We included both retrospective and prospective observational studies. The mean difference (MD) or risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were applied to assess the association between Candida colonization and clinical outcomes.
Results
A total of 8 studies with 1,661 patients were pooled in our final studies. Compared with patients with VAP without Candida colonization, patients with Candida colonization had significantly longer durations of mechanical ventilation (MD, 1.93; 95% CI, 0.53-3.33). The intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay seems to be longer among Candida colonized patients than noncolonized patients, although the results were not so significant (MD, 1.15; 95% CI, –1.04 to 3.34). Patients with colonization had higher 28-day mortality and ICU mortality than those without colonization (28-day mortality: RR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.27-2.12; ICU mortality: RR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.26-1.94).
Conclusions
The presence of Candida spp airway colonization is associated with longer durations of mechanical ventilation, higher 28-day mortality, higher ICU mortality, and probably longer ICU length of stay compared with the absence of colonization in patients with VAP."

We enrolled 2,904 patients from the neurosurgery intensive care unit between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2018. The medical staff undertook an educational program developed by a multidisciplinary team on correct external ventricular drainage insertion and maintenance. The program included a 9-page self-learning module on the HCAMV risk factors and operational improvements. Each participant completed a pre- and posttest on their HCAMV knowledge.
Results
We found that 38 of 693 (5.48%) patients presented with infection in the preintervention 9-month period. In the 27-month postintervention period, the proportion of HCAMV incidence dropped by 52.19% (P < .0001) to 58 of 2,211 (2.62%) patients.
Conclusions
Educational intervention aimed at the neurosurgery intensive care unit staff could significantly reduce the HCAMV rate, leading to a significant decline in the cost, morbidity, and mortality caused by neurosurgical procedures."

A considerable proportion of surgical site infections (SSI) could be prevented by surveillance. The study aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of 3 methods of SSI surveillance: Inpatient, phone, and out-patient clinic (OPC); to ensure that the risk of SSI is independent from loss-to-follow-up in phone and OPC surveillances, and to determine the reliability of phone surveillance.
Methods
A cohort of 351 surgical patients were followed by 3 different surveillance methods: inpatient, follow-up in OPC and over the phone. Costs of nurse time and phone calls were expressed in 2019 USD. Effectiveness of surveillance was assessed using number of detected SSIs.
Results
Phone surveillance was more cost-effective than OPC surveillance. Compared to inpatient surveillance, the OPC method costs USD 15.6 per extra detected SSI, whereas the phone method costs only USD 4.6 In phone and OPC surveillances, the risk of SSI was independent of loss-to-follow-up. However, the higher rate of SSI among OPC attendees raises the suspicion that the incidence of SSI estimated by OPC surveillance could be biased upward. Phone surveillance was reliable with high sensitivity and specificity.
Conclusions
Phone surveillance was a reliable cost-effective method. Inpatient surveillance was less effective, but it still can be used to detect severe SSI at low cost. While out-patient-clinic surveillance had the highest cost, the incidence estimated by it might be biased upward."

Long-term care facility residents are at higher risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection and colonization than the general population. In 2009, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) implemented the “methicillin-resistant S. aureus prevention initiative” in long-term care facilities (ie, Community Living Centers or “CLCs”).
Methods
Over 4 months, 40 semistructured interviews were conducted with staff in medicine, nursing, and environmental services at 5 geographically dispersed CLCs. Interviews addressed knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs concerning infection prevention and resident-centered care. A modified constant comparative approach was used for data analysis.
Results
In CLCs, staff work to prevent and control infections in spaces where residents live. Nurses and Environmental Service Workers daily balance infection prevention conventions with the CLC setting. Infection control team members, who are accustomed to working in acute care settings, struggle to reconcile the CLC context with infection prevention.
Discussion
The focus on the resident's room as the locus of care, and thus the main target of infection control, misses opportunities for addressing infection prevention in the spaces beyond the residents’ rooms.
Conclusions
Environmental Service Workers’ daily work inside the rooms and within the wider facility produces a unique perspective that might help in the design of workable infection control policies in CLCs."

Delayed identification and isolation of patients with Clostridiodies difficile infection (CDI) may contribute to in-hospital transmission and delay appropriate therapy. To assess potential points for intervention, we conducted a retrospective cohort study to determine differences in time-to-testing and time-to-isolation among community-onset (CO), community-onset healthcare facility-associated (CO-HCFA), and hospital-onset (HO) CDI.
Methods
We compared clinical and demographic data of all CO, CO-HCFA, and HO CDI patients at our institution between October 2011 and September 2015. We then performed bivariable analysis on our cohorts to identify differences in time-to-testing and time-to-isolation for CO versus CO-HCFA versus HO CDI patients.
Results
355 patients with CDI were hospitalized during the study; 138 (38.9%) with CO CDI, 52 (14.6%) with CO-HCFA CDI, and 165 (46.5%) with HO CDI. 117 (84.8%) CO CDI patients were tested within 1 day of diarrhea onset compared to 41 (78.8%) of CO-HCFA and 113 (68.5%) of HO CDI patients (P < .01). 51 CO CDI patients (36.7%) were placed on empirical isolation precautions at the time of diarrhea onset compared to 22 (43.1%) of CO-HCFA CDI patients and 32 (19.4%) of HO CDI patients (P < .01).
Conclusions
CO CDI patients are more likely to be isolated empirically and tested earlier than HO CDI patients. Further attention should be paid to isolating hospitalized patients who develop diarrhea as an inpatient."

Since 2015 the Aged Care National Antimicrobial Prescribing Survey has collected and reported data on antibiotic use in Australian aged care homes (ACHs) as part of the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care's Antimicrobial Use and Resistance in Australia project. The objective of this study was to analyze this data source with regards to prescribing for urinary tract infections (UTIs) to improve the use of antibiotics.
Methods
This cross-sectional study analyzed the 2016 and 2017 survey data. Antibiotic prescribing for urinary tract indications was compared with national guideline recommendations.
Results
A total of 662 antibiotic prescriptions from 247 ACHs were analyzed. For all prophylactic antibiotics for UTI, 51.8% were prescribed for longer than 6 months, contrary to the guideline recommendation. Most antibiotics prescribed for treatment (71.6%) were for cystitis. Cefalexin was most frequently selected for treatment of cystitis, with 10.4% of these prescriptions being concordant with the recommendations. Prescribing additional daily doses of cefalexin occurred in 63.2% of prescriptions.
Conclusions
Antimicrobial stewardship activities targeting UTI prophylaxis for durations longer than 6 months, and excessive daily doses of cefalexin to treat cystitis could yield significant reductions in unnecessary antibiotic consumption among Australian residents of ACHs."

A central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) is a serious complication. Patients in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are at increased risk for CLABSI, and hospitals often implement patient safety initiatives to prevent them. Studies have quantitatively demonstrated that line teams can reduce the rate of CLABSI. The purpose of this study was to qualitatively assess the function of the line team.
Methods
Participants of the study were recruited from the NICU of a large children's hospital in Texas. Each participant provided oral consent to participate, and interviews were captured on audio recorder and transcribed. Thematic content analysis was used to evaluate the data.
Results
We found that successful infection prevention requires collaborative work with all personnel in the NICU. We also found that line team personnel function as an extra level of support for bedside nurses, provide guidance on protocols, and serve as educators and trainers. Lastly, we heard several situations in which the essential function of the line team to prevent CLABSI is threatened by other necessary operations of the unit.
Conclusions
It is important for infection prevention initiatives to not only track and measure outcomes, but also consider the processes during implementation. This study provides important insight into the operation of the line team that should be contemplated by hospitals seeking to implement a similar initiative."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of a urine culture standardization program that included order indications and urinalysis (U/A) with reflexive culture. The program applied to all adult and pediatric inpatients at an academic medical center; emergency department and ambulatory clinic patients were excluded.
Methods
The analysis compared outcomes in the pre-implementation (January 2015-May 2016) and post-implementation (July 2016-September 2017) periods. The primary outcomes were urine culture and U/A orders per 1,000 patient days, catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) rate per 1,000 catheter days, and urine culture contamination rate per 1,000 patient days. Catheter standardized utilization ratios (SURs) were also examined.
Results
The intervention was associated with a significant decrease in urine culture rates by 6.9 cultures per 1,000 patient days (95% CI –4.44, –9.44; P < .0001). The U/A testing rate per 1,000 patient days significantly increased pre-intervention, was not affected acutely by the intervention institution, and significantly decreased post-implementation. The CAUTI rate was not significantly changed by the intervention but did significantly increase post-implementation by 0.2 per 1,000 catheter days (95% CI 0.01, 0.47; P = .04); SURs significantly decreased (0.03; 95% CI –0.003, –0.05; P = .03); and the urine culture contamination rate per month showed no significant change. Sixty-four percent of urine cultures ordered using the reflexive test did not reflex to culture by U/A criteria.
Conclusions
A urine culture standardization program led to a significant reduction in urine cultures and did not lead to an increase in U/A testing rates. CAUTI rates increased post-implementation, which may have been confounded by reduced catheter utilization."

Controlling indoor air quality and the airborne transmission of infectious agents in hospitals is critical. The most hazardous particles and pathogens are not easily eliminated by traditionally passive air cleansing.
Methods
We studied the effect of a novel particle control technology on airborne particulate matter in 2 live real-world operating room settings and on pathogen survival in a microbiology laboratory.
Results
Particle control technology reduced operating room particle and pathogen loads by 94.4% in a community hospital operating room, and by 95% in an academic medical center operating room. The addition of particle control technology to a collector loaded with a biologic warfare surrogate resulted in a 95% kill rate of an anthrax surrogate (Bacillus subtilis) within 3 hours.
Discussion
Deployment of this emerging technology could significantly reduce indoor air contamination and associated infections in operating rooms, hospital isolation rooms, and intensive care settings, as well as reduce inflammatory responses to airborne particles.
Conclusions
The particle control technology studied may protect patients from hospital-acquired infections, reduce inflammatory pulmonary disease, and mitigate exposure to biologic weapons."

Influenza is responsible for thousands of deaths in the United States and presents particular challenges in health care facilities with a greater prevalence of people at increased risk for adverse outcomes. Annual influenza vaccination has long been recommended, and employer policies influence the likelihood health care personnel are immunized.
Methods
This is a review of vaccination data maintained by a large health care organization to assess the effects of a mandatory health care personnel vaccination policy implemented during 2008-2009. Vaccination rates, timing of immunizations, and requests for medical or religious exemptions were assessed from 2006-2007 to 2017-2018.
Results
The health care personnel vaccination rate was 70% during the influenza season before the mandatory policy was implemented and increased to 98.4% immediately afterward. Vaccination rates exceeded 97% during the subsequent 9 years. Religious and medical exemptions decreased at academic medical centers and remained consistent at community hospitals. Among immunized employees, the peak date for vaccination shifted to late September or early October compared to late October or early November before the mandatory policy.
Conclusions
Requiring vaccination led to sustained increases in staff vaccination coverage at academic medical centers and community hospitals. The mandatory policy also appeared to encourage earlier vaccination."

Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile infection (CDI) is an important health care-associated infection with variable incidence and prevalence across the globe. There are limited data from Saudi Arabia on the epidemiology of C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD). In this study, we present the epidemiology and incidence of CDAD in a hospital in Saudi Arabia.
Methods
This study included all stool samples from 2001 to 2018 that were tested for C. difficile. C. difficile toxins were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 2001-2012 and the diagnosis was based on PCR testing (2013-2018).
Results
There was a total of 577 distinctive episodes of CDAD representing 5.2% of 10,995 tested stool samples with an annual positivity rate of 0.9%-11.8%. Of all CDAD cases, there were 230 (39.9%) community associated-CDAD, 105 (18.2%) community onset-health care facility associated disease, and 242 (42%) health care facility onset health care facility-associated disease (HCFO-HCFAD). There was a trend of increasing percentage of community onset-health care facility associated disease cases from 17% in 2001 to 20% in 2018 of all cases, and a trend towards less cases of community associated-CDAD from 85% to 50% over time. However, the percentages of HCFO-HCFAD percentages remained relatively stable. The rate of HCFO-HCFAD per 1,000 patient-days increased from 0.009 to 0.22 from 2001 to 2018, respectively.
Conclusions
The rate of CDAD was 5.15% among all tested samples and that there is a large proportion of community associated-CDAD. The findings parallel the data from developed countries and deserve further studies in the risk factors for community-associated CDAD."

Our objectives were to (1) characterize patient and clinical characteristics of adults hospitalized with meningitis; (2) describe meningitis hospitalization outcomes, including 30- and 90-day readmissions; and (3) determine whether clinical, patient, or index hospitalization characteristics are associated with readmission and readmission outcomes.
Methods
This retrospective study of the 2014 National Readmissions Database extracted data on hospitalized adults with a principal diagnosis of meningitis and examined hospitalization outcomes using descriptive statistics. Logistic regression models were built to determine whether characteristics were associated with 30- or 90-day readmissions.
Results
For the 30-day readmission analyses, 18,883 adults qualified. Meningitis hospitalizations commonly involved adults 25 to 54 years of age who were insured by private carriers. The readmission rates were 7.0% at 30 days and 11.4% at 90 days. Readmission was associated with greater comorbidity burden (2 conditions: adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.60, range 1.24-2.08; 3 conditions: AOR = 1.92, range 1.43-2.58; 4+ conditions: AOR = 2.68, range 2.04-3.51 vs 0 or 1 condition), public insurance (Medicare: AOR = 1.85, range 1.30-2.62; Medicaid: AOR = 1.48, range 1.16-1.90 vs private insurance), and medical error (AOR = 1.43, range 1.07-1.91). Readmissions were most often for meningitis, septicemia, or medical complications.
Conclusions
Readmission after hospitalization for meningitis is associated with both fixed and modifiable factors. More research is needed to determine which post-meningitis readmissions are preventable."

Methods
Cross-sectional survey to determine bedside nurses’ recognition and performance confidence in AS. Nine hospitals ranged in size from 42 to 562 beds serving pediatric and adult populations in 2 different metropolitan areas. Composite scores for nursing practices, performance confidence, and organizational factors were developed and correlated. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey HSD post-hoc tests and nonparametric (Kruskal-Wallis) tests with Bonferroni adjusted P values for multiple comparisons were used to evaluate differences by clinical unit and years of clinical experience. Free text comments were categorized by theme.
Results
A total of 558 nurses participated (13% response rate).

This study examines the incidence, characteristics, and risk factors of surgical site infections (SSIs) after spine surgery and evaluates the efficacy of a preventive intervention.
Methods
This was a quasi-experimental pretest/posttest study in patients undergoing spinal surgery in an orthopedic surgery department from December 2014 to November 2016. Based on the results of the study, we revised the preventive protocol with modification of wound dressing, staff training, and feedback. SSI rates were compared between the pre-intervention (December 2014 to November 2015) and post-intervention (December 2015 to November 2016) periods. The risk factors were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analyses.
Results
Of the 139 patients included, 14 cases of SSI were diagnosed, with a significant decrease in the incidence of SSIs from the pre-intervention period to the post-intervention period (19.4% vs 2.6%; P = .001). The etiology was known in 13 cases, with enteric flora being predominant in the pre-intervention group. Univariate analysis showed that age, body mass index, days until sitting and ambulation, and incontinence were statistically significant risk factors. After multivariate analysis, only body mass index and days until ambulation remained significant. When the effect of intervention was adjusted with other risk factors, this variable remained statistically significant.
Conclusions
An intervention that includes modification of wound dressing and early mobilization, as well as staff awareness training, monitoring, and feedback, allowed a significant reduction in the incidence of SSI following spinal surgery, particularly infections caused by enteric flora."

The purpose of this study was to relate experimentally measured log10 human norovirus reductions for a nonresidual (60% ethanol) and a residual (quaternary ammonium-based) hand sanitizer to infection risk reductions.
Methods
Human norovirus log10 reductions on hands for both sanitizers were experimentally measured using the ASTM International Standard E1838-10 method, with modification. Scenarios included product application to: (1) inoculated fingerpads with 30- and 60-second contact times, and (2) hands followed by inoculation with human norovirus immediately and 4 hours later. Hand sanitizer efficacies were used in a mathematical model estimating norovirus infection risk from a single hand-to-fomite contact under low and high environmental contamination conditions.
Results
The largest log10 reductions for the residual and nonresidual hand sanitizers were for a 60-second contact time, reducing infection risk by approximately 99% and 85%, respectively. Four hours after application, the residual hand sanitizer reduced infection risks by 78.5% under high contamination conditions, whereas the nonresidual hand sanitizer offered no reduction.

Log10 virus and infection risk reductions were consistently greater for the residual hand sanitizer under all scenarios. Further data describing residual hand sanitizer efficacy with additional contamination or tactile events are needed.
Conclusions
Residual antinoroviral hand sanitizers may reduce infection risks for up to 4 hours."

abstract = "Background
The effectiveness of aerosol disinfection processes based on peracetic acid (PAA) might differ depending on the surface targeted. Especially antibacterial, oligodynamic materials have to be regarded as they could cause elevated decomposition of PAA.
Aim
This study aimed on the determination of differences in disinfection effectiveness using PAA caused by the treated material.
Methods
Aerosol disinfection of Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores was performed on the antibacterial, oligodynamic materials copper and brass in comparison to stainless steel and aluminium as well as polyvinylchloride, wood, and ceramics. Additionally, the influence of the materials on the decomposition reaction of PAA was evaluated.
Results
For aluminium and stainless steel as well as ceramics and polyvinylchloride, a disinfection of 106 spores of Geobacillus stearothermophilus on 40 cm² was obtained by the employment of 60 mL aerosolized disinfectant/m³ on laboratory scale (0.5 m³). For the application on the oligodynamic materials copper and brass an over 30% higher amount of disinfectant was necessary to achieve significant disinfection results, than for the other material surfaces. In contrast to aluminium and stainless steel, copper and brass caused elevated decomposition of PAA what seems to be the reason for the lowered disinfection effectiveness.
Conclusions
Applying aerosol disinfection processes, in addition to parameters such as room size and geometry, the treated materials have to be considered when determining the necessary amount of disinfectant."

abstract = "Background
Prosthetic joint infections (PJI) can be devastating postoperative complications after total joint replacement (TJR). The role of decolonization of Staphylococcus aureus carriers prior to surgery still remains unclear, and the most recent guidelines do not state a formal recommendation for such strategy. Our purpose was to seek further evidence supporting preoperative screening and S aureus decolonization in patients undergoing TJR.
Methods
This was a quasiexperimental quality improvement study comparing a 5-year baseline of deep and organ-space PJIs (2005- 2010) to a 1-year intervention period (May 2015 to July 2016). The intervention consisted of nasal and throat screening for S aureus preoperatively and decolonization of carriers over 5 days prior to surgery.
Results
Prior to the intervention, we identified 42 deep and/or organ-space PJIs in 8,505 patients undergoing TJR (0.5%). S aureus was the causal microorganism in 28 of 42 (66.6%) cases. During the intervention, 22.5% (424 of 1,883) of patients were S aureus carriers. The PJI rate was similar overall (0.4%, 7 of 1,883; odds ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.34-1.67; P = .58), but there was a significant reduction in S aureus PJI to only 1 case during the intervention (odds ratio, 0.15; 95% confidence interval, 0.004-0.94; P = .039).
Conclusions
Active screening for S aureus and decolonization of carriers prior to TJR was associated with a reduction in PJI due to S aureus, but no changes in overall PJI rates were observed."

Few studies have compared the effectiveness of washing with either soap and water or disposable wet wipes. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of washing with either soap and water or disposable wet wipes in reducing microorganisms in the groin and perineum of hospitalized patients, which could potentially reduce the risk of hospital-acquired urinary tract infections.
Methods
In this crossover, block-randomized trial, skin swabs from the groin and perineum areas of patients were obtained before and after these areas were washed with either soap and water or disposable wet wipes. Columbia agar plates and CHROMagar Orientation Medium (Becton Dickinson; Franklin Lakes, NJ) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry procedures were used to identify species of microorganisms.
Results
Fifty-eight paired skin swabs were obtained. Both washing methods resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the amount of all microorganisms, including microorganisms with the potential to cause urinary tract infections. New species were observed after using both washing methods. No statistically significant difference in the removal of microorganisms was observed between the two washing methods.
Conclusions
The two washing methods appear to be equally efficient in removal of microorganisms in the groin and perineum areas, including microorganisms that potentially could cause hospital-acquired urinary tract infections."

To compare covert closed-circuit television (CCTV) monitoring to standard overt observation in assessing the hand hygiene (HH) conduct of health care workers (HCWs) caring for patients infected with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). This was a cross-sectional study in a general intensive care unit of a 1,000-bed university hospital.
Methods
Forty-six general intensive care unit HCWs (staff physicians, registered nurses, and auxiliary workers) caring for contact isolation MDRO-infected patients. The study incorporated the following 3 phases: phase 1, establishment of interrater reliability between 2 simultaneous observers using the overt observation method; phase 2, establishment of interrater reliability between 2 simultaneous observers using the CCTV method; and phase 3, simultaneous monitoring of HH by both methods to evaluate the suitability of CCTV as an alternative to direct observation of the HH conduct of HCWs caring for MDRO-infected patients.
Results
Overall, 1,104 opportunities to perform HH were documented during 49 observation sessions. The compliance rate observed by the overt method (37.3%) was significantly higher than that observed when only the covert method was used (26.5%). However, simultaneous overt-covert observations were found to have intraclass correlation coefficients of >0.85.
Conclusions
Covert CCTV observation of HCW HH compliance appears to provide a truer and more realistic picture than overt observation, probably because of its ability to neutralize the Hawthorne effect of overt observation. The high intraclass correlation coefficients between covert observation and overt observation supports this conclusion."

Proper hand hygiene helps prevent infectious diseases, while health literacy plays a critical role in preventive health behaviors. It remains unclear as to why proper hand hygiene practices cannot be sustained and what role health literacy plays in older adults fight against infectious diseases.
Methods
A convenience sample of 433 old adults aged 65 and above was recruited. Their hygiene practices and health literacy were evaluated using a structured questionnaire adopted from the Centre for Health Protection and the Chinese version of the HLS-Asia-Q questionnaire.
Results
The percentage distribution of the hand hygiene performance, from always to never, was 18%-10%. A majority 63.28% (274) of them were classified as having inadequate health literacy (0-25), while a meager 1.62% (7) of them as having excellent health literacy (42.01-50). The Spearman correlation showed a significant positive relationship (P < 0.05) between the participants’ health literacy and their hand hygiene practices.
Conclusions
Health literacy and hand hygiene are positively related in helping the older adults fight against infectious diseases. To sustain proper hand hygiene practices is to provide frequent hand hygiene training to the older adults."

Acquisition of pathogens into health care settings from prior room occupants has been documented. Hospital room privacy curtains are at high risk for pathogenic bacterial contamination. Antimicrobial impregnated curtains could be effective in reducing contamination.
Methods
Rooms within an intensive care unit at The University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics were randomized to 3 arms. The 2 intervention arms: (1) halamine antimicrobial curtains (BioSmart curtain [BSC]) and (2) halamine antimicrobial curtains sprayed twice weekly with a sodium hypochlorite-based disinfecting spray (BSC-pre and BSC-post) and a third control arm (standard curtain [SC]). Samples were collected twice weekly for 3 weeks to assess pathogenic bacterial contamination.
Results
The likelihood of remaining uncontaminated was 38% for SC, 37% for BSC, and 60% for the BSC-pre group. Time to event (contamination) analysis found no statistically significant difference between pathogenic contamination between the SC, BSC, and BSC-pre groups (P value = .1921). There was a decrease in average colony count for BSC curtains compared with control, however, this difference was not statistically significant. Hypochlorite spray was found to transiently decontaminate curtains, but effects dissipated after 72 hours.
Conclusions
BSC did not show a significant reduction in pathogenic contamination compared with control. Antimicrobial curtains could have a role in reducing environmental contamination in the health care setting. Future studies should be done to determine the long-term effects of using antimicrobial curtains in health care."

Mycobacterium fortuitum survive in different environmental conditions, biofilm formation and resistance to chlorinated disinfectants makes its isolation frequent in hospital environments, even being involved in outbreaks by contamination of medical equipment such as bronchoscopes. We describe a pseudo-outbreak by M fortuitum isolated in samples from 9 patients who underwent bronchoscopy in the pneumology bronchoscopy unit of the University Hospital Complex of the Canary Islands from December 2016 to March 2017.
Methods
We proceeded to investigate the pseudo-outbreak with a combination of epidemiologic, environmental, and molecular typing data.
Results
The source/reservoir of pseudo-outbreak was the hospital water used by the bronchoscope automatic washing machine (without antibacterial filter), so control measures were taken. Molecular typing was performed on 7 strains from 7 patients, and a sample of water was collected from a tap in the pneumology bronchoscopy unit: all of which had the same pattern.
Conclusions
Our study demonstrates the presence of nontuberculous mycobacteria in the hospital water supply, and thus the need to take measures against them because they compromise patients’ health. We also suggest the need for hospital water quality guidelines in which methods to control and/or eliminate them are established."

Low hand-hygiene compliance (HHC) in low-income countries due to deficient hand hygiene resources may increase nasal carriage of S. aureus, a causative agent of health care-associated infections. The study aimed to assess the effect of using locally available portable alcohol-based handrub (ABHR) regarding nurses’ HHC and nasal carriage of S. aureus.
Methods and Design
Nonrandomized interventional design. Seventy-two (72) of 86 nurses were provided with portable ABHR to use during patient care (intervention group). The remaining 14 nurses constituted the control group. Evaluation was done via HHC observation per WHO 5-moments of HH, determining S. aureus nasal carriage prevalence and HH guideline knowledge assessment via a self-response questionnaire.
Results
In the intervention group, HHC improved from 48.9% to 67.7% (P < .001) especially for hand-hygiene before and after patient contact. Hand-hygiene by handrubbing improved from 16 to 105 moments. There was positive feedback to portable ABHR use from nurses. S. aureus nasal carriage significantly decreased from 30.6% to 21% (P < .031). Negative carriage of S. aureus was significantly associated with increase in HHC (P < .001). Despite the low preintervention HHC, nurses showed considerably high levels of knowledge on relevance of hand hygiene.
Conclusions
Portable ABHR use was associated with improved HHC and reduced S. aureus nasal carriage prevalence. As nurses’ knowledge of HH guidelines was high, provision of portable ABHR compensated for deficient facility HH resources resulting in improved HHC, which effected reduction in nasal carriage of S. aureus among nurses."

A pilot study was conducted to assess the perceptions of visitors, patients, and staff to the presence of a hand hygiene ambassador (HHA).
Methods
Two hundred and twenty-five entrants to various health care settings were surveyed. Only entrants who failed to clean their hands at the alcohol-based handrub (ABHR) station on entry to the lobby were offered application of ABHR by an HHA. Several questions were also asked to assess their attitudes about the presence of an HHA.
Results
When asked whether they think it is a good idea to have an HHA place ABHR on an entrant's hands, the majority of staff, visitors, and patients agreed. No one refused administration of handrub by the HHA.
Discussion
HHA programs have direct and indirect benefits. Although the cost of such an initiative should be considered prior to implementation, it should be weighed against the annual spending for health care–associated infections.
Conclusions
Considering that hand hygiene compliance and health care–associated infection are clearly linked, a new approach using an HHA may help reduce infection, acting as a source of hand hygiene on entry to the hospital and possibly as a reminder to perform hand hygiene elsewhere in the hospital and clinics."

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of an educational and hand hygiene program in daycare centers (DCCs) and homes on acute gastroenteritis (AGE) incidence in children attending DCCs.
METHODS
A randomized, controlled, and open study of 911 children aged 0-3 years attending 24 DCCs in Almería (Spain) with an 8-month follow-up was employed. Two intervention groups of DCCs families performed educational and hand hygiene measures, 1 with soap and water (soap and water group; n = 274), another with hand sanitizer (hand sanitizer group [HSG]; n = 339), and the control group (CG; n = 298) followed usual handwashing procedures. We compared AGE episode rates with Poisson regression model.
RESULTS
seven hundred fourteen AGE episodes were registered, significant differences between HSG and CG children were found during December and January. A multivariate model was applied and the adjusted incidence rate ratios by rotavirus vaccination found significant differences when children were previously vaccinated, the children in the soap and water group had a higher risk of AGE episodes (incidence rate ratio: 1.28, 95% confidence interval:1.0-1.64), compared with those in the HSG.
CONCLUSIONS
This study demonstrated that hand hygiene programs that included hand sanitizer were most effective in the winter months. Further, the largest reduction of AGE episodes occurred in the children that followed hand hygiene programs including hand sanitizer and educational measures for DCC staff, parents, and children, and were vaccinated for rotavirus."

Results
Before, during, and after the QCC activities, the catheter use ratios and mean indwelling time both had a downward trend; meanwhile, the compliance rate of CAUTI prevention measures showed an upward trend. After the interventions, the CAUTI incidence decreased by 1.317‰ immediately, then gradually decreased by 0.510‰ per month. After the completion of QCC, the CAUTI incidence increased by 0.266‰ immediately and increased by 0.070‰ over time, but the difference was not statistically significant.

To evaluate whether using a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to implement an evidence-based bundle can reduce 30-day surgical site infection rates in women undergoing cesarean delivery.
Methods
This observational study with a preintervention and postintervention design included 2576 consecutive women undergoing cesarean delivery at our tertiary care hospital between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2017. The primary outcome was 30-day surgical site infection rate after cesarean delivery defined according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria. The preintervention period span from the January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2014. After initiation of a Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program (ie, a continuous quality improvement program to improve patient safety using a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach adapted on local demands), we introduced a bundle of evidence-based interventions (including preoperative shower, hair removal with clippers, correct antibiotic prophylaxis, maintaining normothermia, glycemic control, and strict compliance with hygiene standards as well as practice good hand hygiene) per January 1, 2015 into clinical routine. The postintervention period span from January 1, 2015 to December 31 2017.
Results
In the preintervention period the overall surgical site infection rate was 16 of 1,060 cesarean deliveries versus in the postintervention period the overall surgical site infection rate was 9 of 1,516 cesarean deliveries (1.50% vs 0.56%; P = .033). This corresponds to a relative risk reduction of over 60% after implementation of the evidence-based bundle (odds ratio 0.39, 95% confidence interval 0.17-0.89; P = .020).

abstract = "Background
Needlestick injuries (NSIs) most commonly occur in conjunction with insulin injections, and nurses had the highest rate of NSIs among different occupational groups. However, only few nurses have the awareness to report these incidents. We aimed to investigate the current reporting status and influencing factors of NSIs caused by insulin injection pen devices among nurses and nursing interns in Peking, China.
Methods
The study consisted of 4,609 nurses and nursing interns in different hospital departments, namely endocrinology wards, medical (except endocrinology) and surgical departments, emergency, outpatient departments, operation theaters, intensive care units, and other departments from 16 districts of Peking, China. A researcher-devised questionnaire was designed to assess the rate of reporting of accidental NSIs and its influencing factors. Descriptive statistics, the χ2 tests, and univariate and multivariate regression were used to analyze the independent influencing factors of reports on NSIs caused by insulin injection pen devices.
Results
Among all participants, most of them were women (97.61%). More than half of the participants had been working as nurses over 5 years (59.58%). Approximately 63.66% of participants had been trained to prevent and deal with accidental NSIs within 1 year. Approximately 19.33% of the participants experienced NSIs before, but only 30.30% of them reported the injury to the management department or director. The main reasons for not reporting were complex/cumbersome reporting procedure (317 of 621; 51.05%), being too busy at work at the time of injury (301 of 621; 48.47%), and low-risk for personal health (197 of 621; 31.72%). Multivariate analysis showed that age (P = .014; odds ratios [OR; 1.063, 1.736]), prior needlestick training education (P = .018; OR [0.406, 0.917]), and written system for preventing (P < .001; OR [0.289, 0.622]) were independent factors associated with reporting of NSIs caused by insulin injection pen devices.
Conclusions
NSIs caused by insulin injection pen devices are common among nurses and are often not reported. It is necessary to provide nurses with regular training to prevent and deal with NSIs. Hospital management departments should adopt a simpler reporting procedure to understand the actual occurrence of NSIs to develop better prevention and improvement measures."

Psychological safety is a critical factor in team learning that positively impacts patient safety. We sought to examine the influence of psychological safety on using recommended health care–associated infection (HAI) prevention practices within US hospitals.
Methods
We mailed surveys to infection preventionists in a random sample of nearly 900 US acute care hospitals in 2017. Our survey asked about hospital and infection control program characteristics, organizational factors, and the use of practices to prevent common HAIs. Hospitals that scored 4 or 5 (5-point Likert scale) on 7 psychological safety questions were classified as high psychological safety. Using sample weights, we conducted multivariable regression to determine associations between psychological safety and the use of select HAI prevention practices.
Results
Survey response rate was 59%. High psychological safety was reported in approximately 38% of responding hospitals, and was associated with increased odds of regularly using urinary catheter reminders or stop-orders and/or nurse-initiated urinary catheter discontinuation (odds ratio, 2.37; P = .002) for catheter-associated urinary tract infection prevention, and regularly using sedation vacation (odds ratio, 1.93; P = .04) for ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention.
Conclusions
We provide a snapshot of psychological safety in US hospitals and how this characteristic influences the use of select HAI prevention practices. A culture of psychological safety should be considered an integral part of HAI prevention efforts."

abstract = "Background
Pathogens may be transmitted in hospitals via patients’ own hands, but little is known about the facilitators and barriers of hand hygiene among inpatients. This study aimed to assess the hand hygiene knowledge, attitudes, and practices of adult inpatients at 5 hospitals.
Methods
The study consisted of a cross-sectional survey distributed followed by structured interviews with randomly selected inpatients. Qualitative data were analyzed independently by 2 researchers using the Theoretical Domains Framework.
Results
A total of 268 surveys were completed, with 66.4% of patients reporting always performing hand hygiene after toileting and 49.2% before eating. The majority of patients (74.6%) stated that they did not want to receive more information about hand hygiene while in the hospital. Key themes identified from 23 interviews include knowledge; environmental context and resources; memory, attention, and decision processes; and social influences.
Conclusions
Self-reported patient hand hygiene rates are suboptimal and there are knowledge gaps among patients as to when to perform hand hygiene, but patients are not receptive to receiving traditional educational interventions. Future interventions to improve patient hand hygiene should focus on other behavior change domains, including environmental context and resources (eg, access to hand sanitizer at the bedside), memory, attention, and decision processes (eg, posters or other reminders), and social influences (eg, role modeling)."

abstract = "Introduction
Reverse osmosis (RO), a major advance in hemodialysis (HD) safety, effectively clears most water organisms. Delftia acidovorans is an environmental water-borne pathogen that is rarely reported to cause human infections. We report a pseudo outbreak caused by colonization of RO machines with D acidovorans with no reported human infections and interventions to improve HD safety.
Methods
Repeated positive RO product water cultures triggered our hospital to initiate an investigation, RO machines were examined for mechanical integrity by biomedical engineers. Cultures of product water as well as RO parts were done. Testing for bacterial relatedness after identification was performed. An investigation was conducted in a systematic fashion to determine the cause and the extent of the problem.
Results
Upon formal review of policies and procedures, there were minor deficiencies. Rectifying these deviations from policies did not stop the repeated positive water cultures. A 7-step investigation and correction was successfully conducted. City water testing with filtration and concentration methods was positive for D acidovorans. Major renovation of the HD unit with replacement of all RO machines and a 2-step water filtration resulted in elimination of the pseudo outbreak.
Conclusion
City water was the source of biofilm formation of D acidovorans in RO machines that was not possible to eradicate. Application of incoming water filters was an effective preventive strategy. Replacement of RO machines after 4 failed disinfection attempts is the most cost-effective strategy as well for persistent positive water cultures. The HD remains RO water culture negative 2 years after changes."

Economic evaluation from the perspective of hospitals is important for the optimization of resources for infection control measures.
Methods
We considered outbreaks that occurred from 2006 to 2016 in Japan. Cost identification analyses were conducted using data from 23 outbreaks by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Linear and multivariable regression analyses were conducted to explore the association between potential factors and main outcomes. The potential factors included duration of the outbreaks, duration of bed blocking, timely public announcement, delay of external consultation, and number of patients at the time of external consultation.
Results
The largest productivity loss was 4.62 million USD. The maximum total cost for containment was 678,000 USD. After considering the overall interactions, timely public announcement was significantly associated with productivity loss (adjusted estimate of coefficient: 1.24 USD, 95% confidence interval [CI] 179,000 to 2.31 million USD, P = .02), and the number of patients at external consultation was significantly associated with containment costs (3 430 USD, 630 to 6 240 USD, P = .02).
Conclusions
The costs of healthcare-associated infection outbreaks of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria can be significant. The productivity loss was much greater than the containment costs. Therefore, hospitals should meet the costs for prevention of these outbreaks."

Health care facilities require frequent renovations to maintain or enhance their service, and to meet the dynamic demands of their patients. Construction activities in active health care facilities are a significant contributor to various challenges that range from infection to death. It is therefore essential to minimize the adverse impacts of construction activities on health care units as well as their adjacent sites.
Methods
A questionnaire was developed to study current training modules to prepare construction crews to work in health care environments. The survey was disseminated among professionals of the top 15 health care contractors. A total of 129 individuals participated, and their responses were analyzed using descriptive and categorical statistics.
Results
This study investigates current training practices regarding (1) the level of training, (2) the frequency of training, and (3) the impact that the sensitivity of the project has on the training. To effectively prepare construction crews, special training must be provided to them.
Conclusions
There are uncertainties about the sufficiency and impact of the existing training. Existing trainings are tailored for upper management positions, and the amount/frequency of training for construction crews are substantially low. Findings of this study contribute to characterizing the activities and conditions pertaining to training of construction crews."

Several factors impact reprocessing effectiveness, including non-adherence to guidelines, use of damaged endoscopes, use of insoluble products during endoscopy, insufficient cleaning, contaminated rinse water, and inadequate drying before storage. Our team suspected that issues with HLD chemistries and monitoring could also contribute to reprocessing failures. We conducted a mixed-methods analysis of published literature, our interviews with frontline personnel, and evidence from our previous studies. The evidence showed that reusable HLDs commonly failed tests for minimum effective concentration (MEC) before their maximum usage periods. MEC tests also detected failures associated with single-use HLDs that did not fully deploy. These failures were due to product issues, process complexities, and personnel non-adherence with guidelines and manufacturer instructions. HLDs will likely continue to be used for the foreseeable future. More research is needed to assess real-world practice patterns related to the high-level disinfection step and MEC testing and to establish more realistic usage periods for reusable HLD chemistries. Manufacturers and researchers should evaluate the ability of technological solutions and engineered safeguards to overcome human error. Recognition of the need for quality improvement is growing, and infection preventionists should take action to build on this momentum and collaborate with manufacturers, endoscopists, and reprocessing personnel to improve the effectiveness of high-level disinfection."

Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) -associated bloodstream infection (BSI) is a concern.
Methods
A case-control study was conducted to assess risk factors for PICC-associated BSI.
Results
A total of 1,215 cases and 31,874 catheter days were analyzed. In total, 54 cases of PICC-associated BSI were detected giving an infection rate of 1.69 per 1,000 catheter-days. The most frequently isolated pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci (26%), followed by Enterococcus species (22%), Candida species (17%), and Staphylococcus aureus (11%). Multivariable analysis identified the significant risk factors for PICC-associated BSI as a prior PICC placement (odds ratio [OR], 2.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36-4.53), medical department admission (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.03-3.46), and older age (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00-1.05). With increasing frequency of previous PICC placement, the rates of PICC-associated BSI increased: 3.5% (31/883) without previous placement, 7.6% (13/171) in once, and 9.9% (9/32) in twice or more.
Discussion
The previous PICC placement was an independent risk factor for PICC-associated BSI and the risk proportionally rose with the increasing frequency of prior PICC placement.
Conclusions
Patients with repeatedly inserted PICC should be managed more carefully for prevention and should be monitored for the development of PICC-associated BSI."

Health care workers wear protective clothing when caring for patients with infectious diseases. However, during the action of patient care, the generated contact pressure may damage the surface of the protective clothing.
Methods
Fabrics of protective clothing were damaged by a machine using a force similar to the contact pressure that occurs during nursing care. A total of 50 μL of blood containing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (5 × 106 colony-forming units/mL) was dropped onto the pressed or rubbed fabrics. After removing the blood, the residual bacterial count on the surface of the clothing was measured.
Results
In the undamaged fabrics, the number of adherent MRSA was significantly higher on class 6 protective clothing than on the other tested clothing. The number of adherent MRSA significantly increased on the rubbed surgical gown and rubbed class 3 protective clothing than on the undamaged clothing.
Conclusions
Because the damaged fabrics of protective clothing may cause bacterial carryover, health care workers should pay attention to preventing self-contamination when doffing the protective clothing."

We aimed to identify risk factors for sepsis diagnosis and possible interaction with length of hospital stay (LOS) among inpatients at a rural Health Professional Shortage Area hospital.
Methods
This case-control study examined 600 adult patients (300 cases and 300 controls) admitted to a rural health system in North Carolina between 2012 and 2018. Case selection was based on assignment of ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes for sepsis. Controls were patients with a medical diagnosis other than sepsis during the observational period. Logistic regression was used to model sepsis diagnosis as a function of indwelling medical device use and stratified by LOS.
Results
Indwelling medical device use preadmission and postadmission were significantly associated with increased risk of sepsis diagnosis among patients with extended hospital stays (LOS ≥ 5 days) (odds ratio [OR] = 5.51; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.95-15.62; P = .001 and OR = 3.28; 95% CI = 1.24-8.68; P = .017, respectively). Among patients with LOS <5 days, association with sepsis diagnosis was only significant for indwelling medical device use preadmission (OR = 9.61; 95% CI = 3.68-25.08; P < .0001).
Conclusions
Indwelling medical device use was significantly associated with increased risk of sepsis diagnosis and the risk was higher with longer hospitalization."

abstract = "Background
Although familial involvement during inpatient care is not uncommon in western countries, the types of caring activities that family members in Asian countries provide are significantly different. These activities may place the family member at risk from a health care–associated infection. This study aimed to examine whether the role of patients’ families has been accounted for in the infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines and policy, using examples from Bangladesh (low-income country), Indonesia (middle-income country), and South Korea (high-income country).
Methods
The World Health Organization website and Institutional Repository for Information Sharing, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, Australian Government Web Archive, Open Grey, Grey Matters, World Bank, and advanced Google search, as well as the Health Department/Ministry of Health websites for each target country and 4 western countries (Australia, Canada, England, and the United States) were searched. Other databases, such as Embase, Medline, CINAHL, Global Health, ProQuest databases, Google scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus were also searched. This was to review the reflection of the cultural influence in IPC policies/guidelines by reviewing those from the global organizations, which are often used as a blueprint for policy development, as well as those from western countries, which hold different cultures in care arrangement. Search was conducted with attention to the key areas: definition and role of carer in the acute health care facility, involvement of patients/family members in IPC activities, patient and family member hand hygiene, and IPC education.
Results
Ninety-two articles were identified based on the criteria for the study. Only 6 acknowledged that care is provided to hospitalized patients by their family members, and only 1 recommended that family members receive the same level of training as health care workers on IPC precautions. Other guides recommended the provision of information on IPC measures as means of patient involvement in the IPC program. Recognition of family caregivers or inclusion of them in the IPC strategies was not included in the target countries’ guidelines.
Conclusions
Although health care workers are the primary actors when it comes to providing care in acute health care settings, it is important to expand the IPC guides by considering the role of other caregivers. Policies and guidelines should reflect the cultural influence over healthcare. This is especially true when cultural values strongly influence over healthcare arrangements and the healthcare accommodates these cultural influences in the practice. Further work needs to be undertaken on the level of training/education provided to family members in Bangladesh, Indonesia, and South Korea."

abstract = "Background
We report the results of International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC) surveillance study from January 2012 to December 2017 in 523 intensive care units (ICUs) in 45 countries from Latin America, Europe, Eastern Mediterranean, Southeast Asia, and Western Pacific.
Methods
During the 6-year study period, prospective data from 532,483 ICU patients hospitalized in 242 hospitals, for an aggregate of 2,197,304 patient days, were collected through the INICC Surveillance Online System (ISOS). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-National Healthcare Safety Network (CDC-NHSN) definitions for device-associated health care–associated infection (DA-HAI) were applied.
Results
Although device use in INICC ICUs was similar to that reported from CDC-NHSN ICUs, DA-HAI rates were higher in the INICC ICUs: in the medical-surgical ICUs, the pooled central line-associated bloodstream infection rate was higher (5.05 vs 0.8 per 1,000 central line-days); the ventilator-associated pneumonia rate was also higher (14.1 vs 0.9 per 1,000 ventilator-days,), as well as the rate of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (5.1 vs 1.7 per 1,000 catheter-days). From blood cultures samples, frequencies of resistance, such as of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to piperacillin-tazobactam (33.0% vs 18.3%), were also higher.
Conclusions
Despite a significant trend toward the reduction in INICC ICUs, DA-HAI rates are still much higher compared with CDC-NHSN's ICUs representing the developed world. It is INICC's main goal to provide basic and cost-effective resources, through the INICC Surveillance Online System to tackle the burden of DA-HAIs effectively."

abstract = "Background
Midline catheters (MCs) are commonly inserted in patients with difficult venous access (DVA) needing peripheral access. Recently, the alternative placement of ultrasound-guided long peripheral catheters (LPCs) has spread. However, no study has compared the reliability of the 2 devices. This study aims to compare the safety and reliability of MCs and LPCs in DVA patients.
Methods
A retrospective cohort study was conducted, enrolling 184 DVA patients. Polyurethane MCs and 2 lengths of polyethylene LPCs (8/10 cm and 18 cm) were compared. The independent effect of catheter type on uncomplicated catheter survival was determined through a Cox regression analysis.
Results
The relative incidences of overall catheter-related complications (CRCs) were 15.84 of 1,000, 10.64 of 1,000, and 6.27 of 1,000 catheter-days for 8/10 cm-LPCs, 18 cm-LPCs, and MCs, respectively. The relative incidences of catheter-related bloodstream infections were 0.72 of 1,000 for both length LPCs and 0.48 of 1,000 catheter-days for MCs. Compared to MCs, a significant increase in CRC risk for 8/10 cm LPCs (hazard ratio [HR] 5.328; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.118-13.404; P < 0.001) was found, along with a nonsignificant trend toward an increased risk for 18 cm-LCPs (HR 2.489; 95% CI 0.961-6.448; P = 0.060).
Conclusion
MCs allow for longer uncomplicated indwelling times than LPCs. The decision regarding which catheter to use should consider the planned duration of intravenous therapy, the patient's clinical condition, and the cost of the device."

Biocidal high-touch surfaces contact surfaces can be used to help reduce healthcare-acquired infections (HAIs). While the bactericidal protocols are well developed, there remains high variability in the methods used to evaluate the virucidal properties of such surfaces. This paper seeks to identify the most commonly used methods and critically evaluate the strengths of each method by comparing tests from standard testing organisations and related bactericidal protocols.
Methods
Three databases and grey literature were queried using a key-word search for relevant articles. Articles were selected if they met the criteria of virucidal properties of self-sterilizing surfaces designed to prevent HAIs. Of the resulting 177 articles, 38 met the inclusion criteria.
Results
The resulting papers varied greatly in their testing methods and recommendations. Further, no standard test adequately meets the needs for specifically testing virucidal properties of self-sterilizing surfaces.
Conclusions
Studies have shown that temperature and humidity can affect the performance of virucidal touch-surfaces, but no standard protocols were found to test these factors."

Limited data are available regarding central venous catheter (CVC)-related complications that occur in home care. A practical out-of-hospital surveillance mechanism is needed.
Methods
Home health/infusion agencies in 4 states submitted monthly data from January 2011 through March 2015. Data were collected by patient age and included number of patients on service with a CVC, device days, central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), CVC-occlusions, doses of fibrinolytics administered, and number of patients receiving fibrinolytics.
Results
Ten agencies from 4 states contributed data across the study period. A total of 913 occlusions and 73 CLABSIs occurred during the 51-month surveillance period. The CLABSI rates per 1,000 device days per year across the study surveillance period ranged from 0-0.40 for pediatric and from 0-0.37 for adult patients, whereas occlusion rates per 1,000 device days ranged from 0.26-1.59 for pediatric and from 2.59-33.29 for adult patients. Doses of fibrinolytic agents administered per 1,000 device days ranged from 0.26-1.80 in pediatric and 3.53-33.85 in adult patients.
Conclusions
Opportunities exist to further expand efforts to quantify the presence of CVCs in home settings to enable improvements with measuring and tracking patient outcomes as they relate to CVC care. Exploration of continued sustainability of surveillance and data validation are warranted to optimize home health/infusion care practices and outcomes."

To prevent health care-associated infections, health organizations recommend that health care workers stringently observe standard precautions (SPs). Nevertheless, compliance with SPs is still suboptimal, emphasizing the need for improvement interventions.
Methods
A cluster randomized controlled trial with a pretest-post-test design was conducted with 121 clinical nurses who worked in different wards of a university hospital. The intervention group (n = 61) had 3 infection control link nurses nominated and attended systematic audits and feedback. The control group (n = 60) received only the standard multimodal approach used in the hospital. Pre- and post-test assessment of SPs compliance was performed via the World Health Organization observational hand hygiene form and Compliance with Standard Precaution Scale Italian version.
Results
At the post-test, nurses in the intervention group reported significantly increased compliance with hand hygiene, whereas no significant improvement was found in the control group. Nurses in both groups reported significantly increased Compliance with Standard Precaution Scale Italian version scores; however, a higher increase and practical significance was observed in the intervention group. Participants who improved their scores were also compared between groups, showing a significantly greater increase of individual scores in intervention group compared to the control group.
Conclusions
The findings of this study provide significant practical implications for hospitals seeking to improve compliance with SPs among nurses, showing the effectiveness of using infection control link nurses combined with systematic audits and feedback."

abstract = "Background
Clostridioides difficile is a major cause of infectious antibiotic resistant diarrhea. C. difficile spores are shed in patient stool, are hearty and difficult to kill. Bedpans are often used by patients with C. difficile infections and require proper handling and cleaning or disposal to prevent the transmission of C. difficile spores and other infectious microorganisms into the environment. Disposable bedpans are often used for convenience, which has consequences from an environmental sustainability perspective.
Aim
This study evaluates the ability for a washer-disinfector device (WD) to efficaciously clean and disinfect C. difficile spores and Escherichia coli from bedpans for sanitary reuse.
Methods
A commercially available WD device was evaluated for both efficacy and thermal disinfection against C. difficile spores and Escherichia coli using one disinfection cycle per test. Bedpans were not rinsed or dumped prior to placement in the WD. Bedpans were sampled using swabs. Microorganisms were eluted from the swabs and log-kill was calculated.
Findings
The average log-kill for C. difficile spores was 3.99 and >7.69 for E. coli. Thermal disinfection results showed an average log kill of 4.31 for C. difficile and >7.23 for E. coli.
Conclusions
The WD was efficacious against both C. difficile spores and E. coli when used according to manufacturer's instructions for use, suggesting a viable alternative to disposable bedpan waste management."

abstract = "Background
The use of surface disinfection wipes after induction of anesthesia improves anesthesia machine cleaning. We assessed whether anesthesia machine surface redesign improves disinfection wipe cleaning by anesthesia residents.
Methods
Sixteen anesthesia residents were assigned to 2 cases in series. The first case was randomly assigned to regional knee or hip surgery, a brief or detailed checklist, and the Perseus A500 (redesigned) or GE Aespire 7900 (conventional) machine. The second case was assigned to the opposite for each condition. Setup checklists included cleaning instructions. Eight machine sites representing redesign were contaminated with fluorescent gel prior to setup and reassessed after setup to assess cleaning efficacy. Cleaning was compared by fluorescence quantification of before and after setup images. Our primary hypothesis was that, overall, more sites would be cleaned on the Perseus machine. Our secondary hypothesis was that redesign would affect some sites.
Results
Overall, the number of sites cleaned did not differ between machines (median 0.74 more sites out of 8 for the Perseus A500; 25th and 75th percentiles, –0.34 and 1.04; P = .093). However, greater cleaning was observed for the work surface and manual bag arm/hose of the Perseus machine (0.58 more sites out of 2; 25th and 75th percentiles, 0.35 and 1.05; P = .0004).
Conclusions
The number of sites cleaned overall did not differ between the conventional and redesigned Perseus A500 machines. However, the redesigned work surface and smooth manual bag arm features improved resident cleaning with surface disinfection wipes."

Patient and visitor hand hygiene has the potential to prevent health care–associated infections, but there are few data on the efficacy of interventions to improve patient/visitor hand hygiene.
Objective
To determine whether conventional and front-line ownership (FLO) patient/visitor hand hygiene interventions improve patient/visitor and health care worker (HCW) hand hygiene rates.
Methods
A stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted on inpatient units and the emergency department. A conventional intervention included pediatric-focused posters, which also served as reminders for HCWs. This was compared to a FLO intervention aimed at finding “positive deviants,” staff who were already taking steps to improve patient/visitor hand hygiene. Patient/visitor and HCW hand hygiene rates were measured covertly by trained medical students.
Results
Patient/visitor hand hygiene rates increased from 9.2% at baseline to 13.9% in the post-intervention period. Hand hygiene rates on units randomized to the standard intervention changed from 7.3% to 10.9% (P = .46), but FLO intervention units significantly changed from 14.3% to 25% (P = .03). The baseline HCW hand hygiene rate was 68.2%, which increased to a greater extent in the FLO group (79.1%) than in the standard intervention (73.1%), but the change was not statistically significant for either intervention compared to control (P = .18 and P = .64, respectively).
Conclusions
Hand hygiene interventions in hospitals can improve patient/visitor and HCW hand hygiene rates, and a FLO intervention appears to be more effective than a conventional intervention."

We aimed to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic colonization by C. difficile in stool of residents in four long-term care facilities (LTCFs) in Graz, Austria and to identify factors associated with colonization.
Methods
We conducted a point-prevalence study in March 2018. Stool samples were examined by GDH enzyme immunoassay and when positive a toxin A/B-enzyme immunoassay was carried out. Additionally, all samples were tested by toxin A and B PCR and were plated manually as well as in automated fashion onto selective C. difficile agar.
Results
In 4/144 (2.8%) residents the GDH assay was positive. Each resident was colonized by a different C. difficile ribotype. C. difficile was not detected in any of the environmental samples. Significantly more colonized residents (60%) had stayed at a hospital in the 3 months previous to the study compared to 10% of non-colonized patients (p=0.01).
Conclusions
The prevalence of colonization by toxigenic C. difficile was 2.8% in patients in LTCFs in Graz, Austria."

A consensus on a central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) surveillance definition in home infusion is needed to standardize measurement and benchmark CLABSI to provide data to drive improvement initiatives
Methods
Experts across fields including home infusion therapy, infectious diseases, and healthcare epidemiology convened to perform a 3-step modified Delphi approach to obtain input and achieve consensus on a candidate home infusion CLABSI definition.
Results
The numerator criterion was identified by participants as involving one of the 2 following: (1) recognized pathogen isolated from blood culture and pathogen is not related to infection at another site, or (2) one of the following signs or symptoms: fever of 38°C (100.4°F), chills, or hypotension (systolic blood pressure ≤90 mm Hg), and one of the 2 following: (A) common skin contaminant isolated from 2 blood cultures drawn on separate occasions and organism is not related to infection at another site, or (B) common skin contaminant isolated from blood culture from patient with intravascular access device and provider institutes appropriate antimicrobial therapy. The criteria for a denominator included days from the day of admission with a central venous catheter to day of removal of central venous catheter. In addition, 11 inclusion criteria and 4 exclusion criteria were included.

Italy is one of the largest consumers of broad-spectrum agents (BSAs) in Europe. This study evaluated surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis (SAP) compliance with the Italian national guidelines and its impact on surgical site infection (SSI) risk.
Methods
A prospective study was conducted in 42 hospitals participating in the national surveillance system for SSIs. SAP compliance was evaluated considering antibiotic choice, duration of administration, and timing of first dose. Trends in the consumption of 5 BSAs were also evaluated.
Results
Between 2012 and 2017, 24,861 surgical procedures were monitored. The risk ratios (RRs) for appropriate SAP increased by 22% each year, and significant increasing trends over time were found for overall compliance, timing, and duration. Adequate antibiotic choice and duration of administration were associated with a significantly reduced SSI risk (RR = 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-0.65 vs RR = 0.51; 95% CI, 0.45-0.57, respectively), and overall compliance was associated with a RR of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.59-0.72).
Conclusions
These findings suggest that appropriate narrow-spectrum agents could be more effective than BSAs in preventing SSIs. Interventions to improve SAP compliance with guidelines could significantly contribute to reducing antimicrobial resistance by reducing SSIs and promoting more prudent use of antimicrobials."

Conflicting evidence exists regarding probiotics and the incidence of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). This study evaluates whether probiotics are efficacious for CDI prophylaxis in patients receiving antibiotics.
Methods
A retrospective cohort analysis of patients admitted to NYU Winthrop Hospital who received at least 1 dose of antibiotics considered high risk of inducing CDI. Patients were grouped according to probiotic use; association between probiotic use and incident CDI was examined. A model for incident CDI adjusting for known CDI risk factors was estimated.
Results
Of 3,267 patients, 4.6% had CDI within 12 weeks of antibiotics initiation. A total of 5.1% received probiotics within 24 hours of initiation, and 6.6% initiated probiotics during the 12-week follow-up. Of those taking probiotics within 24 hours of antibiotics, 9.6% had CDI, and of those not taking probiotics 4.2% had CDI (relative risk, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.4, 3.7). In time-dependent Cox models accounting for probiotic initiation and adjusting for potential confounders, a positive association between probiotics and CDI remained significant (hazard ratio, 2.7; P < .001).
Discussion
Patients who received antibiotics with concurrent probiotics were more likely to have an incident of CDI compared with those who did not receive probiotics. Additional risk factors were histamine 2 receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors, and administration of multiple antibiotics simultaneously.
Conclusions
The present study, because of its large population and inclusion of multiple variables playing a role in CDI, serves as a valuable resource when considering efficacy of probiotics as CDI prophylaxis."

Measures for the prevention of postsurgical infections include issuing special scrubs for the operating room (OR) and prohibiting walking out of the OR complex wearing these scrubs. The aim of this study was to provide further data on bacterial contamination of surgical scrubs.
Methods
Specimens were collected at the entrance to the OR from surgical scrubs worn by surgeons. Participants completed a questionnaire regarding the times, places, and activities in which they were involved during the time interval they were wearing the scrubs.
Results
Among the 133 surgeons who participated, the median colony-forming unit (CFU) count was higher (39 CFU/plate) for their scrubs than for clean scrubs worn by the control group (3 CFU/plate; n = 11; P < .001), but there was no significant difference between the study and control groups in the rate of carriage of pathogenic bacteria (13% and 9%, respectively). The majority of the bacteria isolated were considered commensals. Fifty-five (41%) of the surgeons stated that before sampling they took part in medical activities, and 45 (34%) participated in non-medical activities. Practicing these activities was associated with a higher number of CFUs compared to not being involved in such activities (P < .05).

Prolonged antibiotic duration of therapy is common in long-term care (LTC) settings and associated with increased risk of harm for residents. To identify potential antibiotic stewardship opportunities aimed at prolonged duration of therapy, this study examined barriers and enablers to using shorter courses of antibiotic therapy in the LTC setting.
Methods
Semistructured interviews were conducted with prescribers in LTC home settings, and a total of 8 LTC clinicians participated in the study. Questions and clinical scenarios explored the factors influencing the decisions of prescribers about duration of therapy. Using the Theoretical Domains Framework, interview data were analyzed deductively.
Results
The themes identified that influence duration of antibiotic therapy in LTC were environmental context and resources, knowledge, beliefs about consequences, social influences, and behavioral regulation. Specific concerns described by participants included the perceived lack of evidence to support shorter courses in LTC residents, the misconception that shorter courses could lead to greater rates of resistance, and the strong role of habit and prior experience in selecting antibiotic duration.
Discussion
There are several factors affecting antimicrobial duration prescribing behavior aside from the clinical scenario itself. Tackling misconceptions and providing educational support may be helpful approaches.
Conclusions
These findings provide theory-informed evidence to support the development of antimicrobial stewardship interventions aimed at improving duration of antibiotic therapy."

Surgical site infection is a major postoperative complication after surgical procedures. The effectiveness of postoperative antimicrobial dressings in reducing surgical site infections is unclear and limited information is available on the efficacy of chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG)-impregnated postoperative dressings.
Methods
A pilot study was conducted to examine the efficacy of an innovative CHG-impregnated postoperative dressing in reducing the burden of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in an in vivo porcine, incisional-wound model. Sutured incisional wounds were contaminated with MRSA and then covered with a CHG wound dressing, a placebo control, or a nonantimicrobial gauze. The surviving MRSA population was quantitatively cultured 3 days postprocedure.
Results
MRSA was not recovered from any of the 8 wounds that were treated with the CHG dressing (limit of detection, approximately 1.7 log10 colony-forming units [cfu]/g tissue). In contrast, the average microbial recovery from wounds treated with the placebo dressing was 4.2 log10 cfu/g and the average microbial recovery from wounds treated with the gauze dressing was 3.2 log10 cfu/g.
Conclusions
An innovative CHG dressing provided significant antimicrobial activity against MRSA contaminating a surgical wound in a porcine, incisional-wound model. Future clinical studies are needed to assess the efficacy of the CHG dressing to reduce the bacterial burden in postoperative wounds of surgical patients."

There is strong evidence showing the need for quantitative assessment of the efficacy of cleaning medical devices. Studies comparing visual and microscopic analysis have demonstrated that visual inspection alone is insufficient to determine cleanliness.
Our objective was to
collect baseline adenosine triphosphate testing data for surgical instruments to inform future quality improvement programs, and to develop a process to comply with standards recommended by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation.
Methods
The central sterilization processing department (CSPD) identified difficult to clean tools in hip, spinal fusion, and colon procedures. Instruments used during the procedures were swabbed at arrival to the CSPD, after manual washing, and after a standard 24-minute machine wash cycle. Each instrument was swabbed in a uniform manner on surface areas including hinged joints and teeth, consistent with manufacturer recommendations. Instruments were tagged to ensure accuracy of tracking.
Results
The mean relative light unit (RLU) readout of all instruments on entry to the CSPD, postmanual wash, and postmachine wash was 240,416, 3,352, and 47, respectively. A total of 97.7% of all instruments had a passable final RLU readout. One Rongeur had a failed final RLU readout of 171.
Conclusions
This study suggests that the current cleaning process is adequate for the instruments tested. Ongoing quality assessment would be beneficial to validate other instruments."

Central line–associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are among the most common complications of central venous catheters (CVCs). The aim of this study was to examine the epidemiology of CLABSIs in tunneled CVCs and analyze their risk factors in a general pediatric population.
Methods
Children with a tunneled CVC inserted at the University Children's Hospital Zürich between January 2009 and December 2015 were eligible for the study. The influence of CVC dwell time on the risk of CLABSI was examined using life tables. Hazard ratios (HRs) for CLABSIs were analyzed using Cox regression for age and diagnosis with cluster robust standard errors.
Results
Fifty-five CLABSIs were observed in 193 patients with 284 tunneled CVCs. Overall, CVCs in children with gastrointestinal disorders and in children 2 to 5 years of age showed the highest incidence rates of 6.06 and 5.85 CLABSIs per 1,000 catheter days, respectively, during the first 90 days after placement. Gastrointestinal disease (HR, 3.89; 95% CI, 2.19-6.90; P < .001) and age 2 to 5 years (HR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.45-4.22; P = .001) were identified as independent risk factors for CLABSI. In children without gastrointestinal disease, tunneled CVCs showed an increasing risk of CLABSI after a dwell time of 90 days.
Conclusions
The need for tunneled CVCs requires the evaluation of targeted CLABSI prevention measures, especially in young children with underlying gastrointestinal disease."

The hospital environment is an important source of multidrug-resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Here, we evaluated the efficacy of pulsed xenon ultraviolet (PX-UV) disinfection in addition to manual cleaning in a Japanese hospital.
Methods
Environmental samples were collected from inpatient rooms that had been occupied for at least 48 hours by patients infected or colonized with MRSA. High-touch surfaces from 11 rooms were sampled before and after manual cleaning and then after PX-UV disinfection. Changes in bacterial counts and in the number of aerobic bacteria (AB)- and MRSA-positive samples between sampling points were assessed. The time taken to complete PX-UV treatment of patient rooms was also recorded.
Results
A total of 306 samples were collected. PX-UV disinfection resulted in a significant decrease in abundance of AB and MRSA (mean colony-forming units 14.4 ± 38.7 to 1.7 ± 6.1, P < .001 and 1.1 ± 3.9 to 0.3 ± 2.0, P < .001, respectively) and in the number of AB- and MRSA-positive samples (58.8%-28.4%, P = .001 and 19.6%-3.9%, P < .001, respectively) compared with manual cleaning.

Receipt of an annual flu vaccination (AFV) is a preventative health measure that reduces the risk of infection with the flu. Screening for cancer (SC) is another recommended preventative health measure. The current study hypothesizes that people who have previously obtained a cancer screening are motivated to receive other preventative health measures.
Methods
Testing the association between a history of SC and receipt of an AFV used data from the 2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey. The association was investigated using weighted and adjusted multivariable logistic regression models on multiple age-based groups chosen according to cancer screening recommendations.
Results
The odds of individuals with a history of SC receiving an AFV were significantly greater in women screened for colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer, and men screened for colorectal cancer, when compared with those without a history of SC after adjusting for confounders of interest. It is notable that no association was found between screening for cervical cancer and the receipt of AFV for women aged 30-65 years (odds ratio: 1.06; 95% confidence interval: 0.92, 1.21), and 50-65 years (odds ratio: 1.14; 95% confidence interval: 0.93, 1.40).

The primary aim of this project was to achieve zero transmission of MRSA among all neonatal unit admissions, and secondary aims were to improve hand hygiene (HH) and environmental hygiene compliance to 100%.
Methods
Existing inpatient admission processes, staff HH, and environmental hygiene practices were critically analyzed. Sequential interventions were implemented, including reinforcing staff awareness on infection control practices through regular education and updates, providing “just in time” feedback, ensuring easy availability of cleaning equipment, individualizing items for all patients, keeping personal belongings away from clinical areas, and revising admission work flow for ex-utero transferred babies from other hospitals.
Results
The neonatal unit achieved zero MRSA transmission to previously noninfected and noncolonized patients over the 9-month period, and HH and environmental hygiene compliance improved from a preintervention median of 87.1% and 82.2%, respectively, to 100%, which has been sustained to date.
Conclusions
Intensive reinforcement of infection control practices, strict cohorting of ex-utero transfers, universal surveillance on admission, and improvement in HH and environmental hygiene compliance were key to infection prevention and control measures, resulting in elimination of MRSA transmission in our neonatal unit."

abstract = "Background
Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) lead to poor health outcomes in hospitalized patients and may be disproportionately affecting the aging population of people living with HIV (PLWH). This study determined the association between HIV and HAIs, and analyzed the potential mediating effects of comorbidities.
Methods
The Louisiana Hospital Inpatient Discharge Database for the years 2011-2015 was used. All patients with at least 1 HAI diagnosis within this source population were included as cases in the case-control study, and a 1:1 ratio of controls was randomly selected from the same hospitals.
Results
Of the 1,852,769 eligible hospital discharges that occurred from 2011 through 2015, there were 7,422 patients with at least 1 HAI. Marginal logistic regressions of the case-control sample showed a strong association between HIV and central line–associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), but an inverse association between HIV and any HAI. However, the mediation analyses revealed that having at least 1 comorbidity mediates the association between HIV and CLABSIs.
Discussion
The unexpected inverse association between HIV and HAI could be attributed to the sample size of the exposed group of patients, or it could be explained by the mechanisms of treatment for HIV patients.
Conclusions
This study found that people living with HIV are at an increased risk of developing a CLABSI, which is consistent with the published literature. The mediation analyses indicated that having at least 1 comorbidity mediated the association between HIV and CLABSI diagnosis."

abstract = "Background
Acinetobacter baumannii causes increasingly resistant nosocomial infections worldwide. Although some patients are already colonized with A baumannii on hospital admission, others become colonized with endemic strains that are more likely to be antibiotic-resistant. Colonization increases risk of infection and transmission to others. This study aimed to identify risk factors for colonization with endemic compared to sporadic A baumannii among hospitalized patients.
Methods
The study population were patients colonized with A baumannii at a single medical center during a 17-month period of active surveillance. Endemic A baumannii (cases) had a repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) type that occurred 10 or more times during the surveillance period. Cases carrying 1 of the 5 endemic REP types were matched to comparison cases (controls) carrying sporadic strains by facility and time.
Results
There were 69 cases with REP-1, and 64 with REP-2-5. After adjustment, each unit increase in Schmid score was associated with a 70% increase in REP-1 carriage (P = .04) and a 50% increase in REP-2-5 (P = .07). Days in the intensive care unit prior to colonization, longer length of stay, immunosuppression, and the Charlson comorbidity index were not significantly associated with carriage of endemic strains.
Conclusions
Following best practices for antibiotic stewardship and hygiene will help minimize the emergence and persistence of A baumannii strains adapted to the health care environment."

Methods
In pediatric patients scheduled for surgery, a quasi-experimental study was carried out over a 2-year period to evaluate the efficacy of 2 types of oral hygiene interventions. There were 2 groups of intervention with 1 group for comparison. Intervention groups were tooth brushing by a dentist (intervention group 1) and dental brushing by parents + chlorhexidine gluconate (intervention group 2). Data from the year with no oral hygiene interventions were used as the baseline group.
Results
A total of 2,535 surgical procedures were followed. Baseline group incidence of postoperative pneumonia was 10 per 1,000 surgeries, 0.2 per 1,000 surgeries in the intervention group 1 (P = .04), and 0.8 per 1,000 surgeries in the intervention group 2.

Few data are available on hospital-wide incidence of central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) rates in patients with central venous catheter (CVC) in China, where many systemic obstacles holding back evidence-based guidelines implementation exist.
Methods
This study was conducted prospectively in 2 phases. The baseline and intervention phases were performed in a teaching hospital in China, between January 2017 and October 2018. A systematic quality improvement (SQI) and multidisciplinary teamwork (MDT) CLABSI infection control program was introduced in the intervention phase. In the intensive care units (ICUs) and non-ICUs, CLABSIs were continuously monitored, data collected, then analyzed.
Results
After intervention, the CLABSI rate decreased from 2.84-0.56 per 1,000 CVC days in ICUs (P < .001), and from 0.82-0.47 per 1,000 CVC days in non-ICUs (P = .003).

Despite World Health Organization recommendations that patients should play a role in encouraging hand hygiene (HH) as a means of preventing infection, patient engagement remains an underused method. From the perspectives of hospitalized patients (HPs) and health care workers (HCWs) at 2 major public hospitals in Haifa, Israel, this research investigated (1) HP barriers to reminding HCWs to maintain HH, (2) HCW barriers to giving HPs instruction on proper hygiene, (3) what could help HPs and HCWs overcome these barriers, and (4) how video clips can be used to devise tailored strategies governing discourse on HH between HCWs and HPs.
Methods
Intervention type 2 design and examination of 2 population groups—HPs and HCWs—before and after intervention by means of mixed methods research.
Results
Both HPs and HCWs reported partial knowledge, embarrassment, and fears regarding commenting to staff, as well as a lack of cultural adaptation. The interviewees indicated that the video clips granted legitimacy to reminding HCWs about hygiene through strategies designed to identify and solve barriers, authenticity, and cultural adaptation.
Conclusions
To overcome HP and HCW barriers to maintaining HH, tailored video clips on HH should specify barriers and solutions with which they can both identify, thus turning discourse on HH into an accepted norm."

Automated hand hygiene monitoring systems (AHHMS) are being developed to supplement direct observations of hand hygiene (HH). We compared compliance rates generated by direct observations and by a badge-based AHHMS.
Methods
Observations of HH compliance were conducted in a surgical intensive care unit (SICU) and a general medical ward (GMW) during a 7-month baseline period and a 13-week intervention period, when compliance was also estimated using an AHHMS. Compliance rates were analyzed using time-series analysis.
Results
During the entire pre- and postintervention period, univariate analysis of observations revealed significant improvement in overall HH compliance in the SICU (P = .001) and the GMW (P = .03), beginning before implementation of the AHHMS. Initiation of the AHHMS was associated with a transient drop in entry and exit compliance on both units. During the intervention period, observations suggested that compliance on entry and exit continued to increase in the SICU, but not in the GMW. Time series analysis of AHHMS data revealed that entry and exit compliance did not change significantly in the SICU but decreased significantly in the GMW (P = .001). The average accuracy of the AHHMS was 60%.
Conclusions
Based on observations, HH compliance increased during the baseline period. Observations and the AHHMS yielded different trends in compliance. The AHHMS's accuracy of HH events and health care personnel location were suboptimal."

Methods
From 2016 to 2018, 3 techniques, the conventional flushing sampling method, flush-brush-flush sampling method (FBFSM), and pump-assisted sampling method (PASM), were compared covering all 59 endoscope units in Tianjin, China.
Results
A total of 237 (84.64%) flushing channel samples and 110 (61.11%) final rinse water samples met the Chinese national standard. The univariate analysis showed that the qualified rates of endoscope reprocessing sampled by PASM (65.52%) and FBFSM (75%) were significantly lower than those of the conventional flushing sampling method (91.38%). Five other factors, including the final rinse water, dry, and hospital level, were potential factors besides sample technique. The multivariate logistic analysis indicated only 2 factors (sampling technique and final rinse water) remained in the model. FBFSM, PASM, and the purified water were significantly associated with the odds of endoscope reprocessing failure, with the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of which were 4.206 (1.757-10.067), 5.326 (2.463-11.645), and 0.309 (0.137-0.695), respectively.

Little is known about the patient experience with urinary catheters or peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs). We sought to better understand patient perspectives on having a urinary catheter or a PICC by reviewing open-ended comments made by patients about having either of these 2 devices.
Methods
As part of a larger study, we asked patients about certain catheter-related complications at the time of catheter placement and on days 14, 30, and 70 (PICCs only). In this larger project, we performed a structured assessment that included an open-ended question about other comments (initial interview) or problems (follow-up interview) associated with the device. For the current study, we conducted a descriptive analysis of these open-ended comments, classifying them as positive, negative, or neutral.
Results
Positive comments about urinary catheters accounted for 9 of 147 comments (6%), whereas positive comments about PICCs accounted for 10 of 100 comments (10%). Positive comments for both catheter types were mostly related to convenience. More than 80% of comments about both types of devices were negative and fell into the following areas: catheter malfunction; pain, irritation, or discomfort; interference with activities of daily living; provider error; and other.
Conclusions
Our findings underscore the need to optimize the patient experience with placement, ongoing use, and removal of urinary catheters and PICCs."

Although educational programs could enhance knowledge, practices, and compliance with hand hygiene (HH) for health care workers, the researches focusing on effective methods for educating and increasing the compliance with HH practices are scanty. Consequently, the researchers conducted the present study to assess HH-related knowledge, attitude, and compliance rate after the implementation of a modified version of the World Health Organization (WHO) multimodal strategy was written in the background.
Methods
A pretest–posttest quasiexperimental study was conducted in a university hospital in Cairo among 84 nurses. The study consisted of 4 phases: baseline assessment, intervention, postintervention assessment, and follow-up phase. The intervention (HH-campaign) consisted of 4 components: infrastructure change, training/education of health care workers, posting visual reminders, and development of institutional safety climate “hand hygiene champions.”
Results
HH compliance rate significantly increased from 28% before the intervention to 50% after the intervention and 58% after the follow-up period (P < .001). The knowledge score and the attitude score significantly improved before and after the intervention (P < .001). The use of alcohol handrub significantly increased from 9.5% before the intervention to 65% after the intervention and 76% after the follow-up period.
Conclusions
Implementation of a modified version of the World Health Organization multimodal strategy successfully doubled HH compliance rates. Tackling a social way of thinking together with regular frequent training and follow-up are essential to sustain adherence to safe HH practices."

abstract = "Background
Low adult immunization rates leave adults at risk from infectious disease, and the resulting complications of vaccine-preventable diseases. Standing orders protocols (SOPs) for adult immunization have not been implemented widely in clinics serving adult patients. Our purpose was to evaluate the impact of SOPs on adult immunization rates and identify challenges to sustaining adult immunization coverage rates after implementation of SOPs.
Methods
Baseline adult vaccination rates were calculated for the year prior to SOPs implementation in 5 diverse clinics. Vaccines included in the implemented standing orders included Tdap, influenza, pneumococcal, human papillomavirus, herpes zoster, and hepatitis B. Adult vaccination rates were tracked for 1 year after SOPs implementation.
Results
Sites generally sustained modest gains in coverage rates (4%-8% increase) after SOP implementation, but greater success was found in practices that used SOPs as a foundation on which additional interventions were built. Challenges to increasing coverage rates included prioritization of acute and chronic conditions over adult vaccination, Medicare Part D reimbursement policies, electronic medical record issues related to data reporting and programming for patient alerts, and the lack of interoperability between the state immunization information system (missing patient vaccination history) and electronic medical record.
Conclusions
SOPs may provide a good starting point for increasing adult immunization coverage rates. Using additional interventions, quality-based metrics, or incentives could lead to sustained adult immunization prioritization."

Peripheral intravenous catheters (PIVCs) break the skin barrier, and preinsertion antiseptic disinfection and sterile dressings are used to reduce risk of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI). In this study, the impact of PIVC skin site colonization on tip colonization and the development of CRBSI was investigated.
Methods
A total of 137 patients’ PIVC skin site swabs and paired PIVC tips were collected at catheter removal, cultured, and bacterial species and clonality were identified.
Results
Of 137 patients, 45 (33%) had colonized skin sites and/or PIVC tips. Of 16 patients with paired colonization of both the skin site and PIVC tips, 11 (69%) were colonized with the same bacterial species. Of these, 77% were clonally related, including 1 identical clone of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a patient with systemic infection and the same organism identified in blood culture.
Conclusions
The results demonstrate that opportunistic pathogen colonization at the skin site poses a significant risk for PIVC colonization and CRBSI. Further research is needed to improve current preinsertion antiseptic disinfection of PIVC skin site and the sterile insertion procedure to potentially reduce PIVC colonization and infection risk."

Methods
We investigated the outbreak of B cepacia infection from January 2017 to March 2018. The investigation included a detailed review of all cases, and field investigations. Environmental and product cultures were performed at the microbiology laboratory in the hospital. Isolates were evaluated for molecular relatedness using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis performed in an independent laboratory.
Results
In total, 9 patients were infected from November 2017 to March 2018, and all patients had undergone the following surgeries: transurethral resection of the prostate (n = 4), perineal prostate biopsy (n = 2), transurethral resection of bladder tumors (n = 2), and ureteroscopy (n = 1). B cepacia was isolated from the urine of 9 patients, blood of 2 patients, grilles used for puncturing, and 2 samples in 1 batch of analgesic gels. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis confirmed that the isolates from the patients and gels were homologous.

Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is recommended in pregnant women and prior to urologic procedures with anticipated mucosal disruption. However, there is still insufficient evidence of the usefulness of treating ASB prior to urologic procedures. Therefore, the aim of this study was to ascertain the risk of infections in patients undergoing urologic surgery based on the presence of ASB.
Methods
We conducted a cohort study among patients undergoing urologic surgery at a single center located in Medellín, Colombia. All patients were screened for ASB prior to their procedures. Patients were evaluated for the development of any postoperative infectious complications for up to 30 days after the procedure.
Results
A total of 149 patients were included in this cohort. Incidence of ASB was 14.8%. Thirteen patients (8.72%) developed infectious complications: 3 (13.64%) with ASB and 10 (7.87%) without ABS. Factors associated with postoperative infectious complications included urologic cancers (hazard ratio [HR], 5.26; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 1.24-22.37), urologic interventions in the preceding 3 months (HR, 3.72; 95% CI, 1.02-13.51), and use of antibiotics 3 months prior to surgery (HR, 3.83; 95% CI, 1.01-15.49). Presence of ASB was not associated with postsurgical infectious complications (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.26-3.96).
Conclusions
There was no association between ASB and postoperative infectious complications. There were other factors associated with infectious complications, such as urologic cancer, previous history of urologic manipulation, and antibiotic use."

Multiple studies have shown that bathing with chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) wipes reduces hospital-acquired infections (HAIs). We employed a mathematical model to assess the impact of CHG patient bathing on central line–associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), and hospital-onset Clostridium difficile (C diff) infections and the associated costs.
Methods
Using a Markov chain, we examined the effect of CHG bathing compliance on HAI outcomes and the associated costs. Using estimates from 2 different studies on CHG bathing effectiveness for CLABSI, CAUTI, and C diff, the number of HAIs per year were estimated along with associated costs. The simulations were conducted, assuming CHG bathing at varying compliance rates.
Results
At 32% reduction in HAI incidence, increasing CHG bathing compliance from 60% to 90% results in 20 averted infections and $815,301.75 saved cost.
Conclusions
As CHG bathing compliance increases, yearly HAIs decrease, and the overall cost associated with the HAIs also decreases."

Biofilm removal is a challenge during surgical instrument processing. We analyzed the time required for Staphylococcus epidermidis to form biofilms on surgical instruments, and how cleaning methods removed them.
Methods
Different areas (ratchet, shank, and jaw) of straight crile forceps were contaminated by soaking in Tryptic Soy Broth containing 106 colony forming units (CFU)/mL of S epidermidis for 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours. S epidermidis adhesion and removal, after manual or automated ultrasonic cleaning, was evaluated by microbiological culture and scanning electron microscopy.
Results
Microbial load increased with time (101-102 CFU/cm2 after 1 hour; 104 CFU/cm2 after 12 hours). Exopolysaccharide was detected after 2 hours and gradually increased thereafter. Bacterial load was reduced by 1-2 log10 after manual cleaning and 1-3 log10 after automated cleaning, but biofilms were not completely eliminated. In general, bacterial load was lower in shank fragments. This difference was significant at 6 hours.
Conclusions
Rapid adhesion of S epidermidis and exopolysaccharide formation was observed on surgical instruments. Automated cleaning was more effective than manual cleaning, but neither method removed biofilms completely. The precleaning conditions and the forceps design are critical factors in processing quality."

Urinary catheterization, even of short duration, increases the risk of subsequent urinary tract infection (UTI). Whether the bacteria found on the surface of catheters placed for <3 days are associated with UTI risk is unknown.
Methods
We screened the biofilms found on the extraluminal surface of 127 catheters placed for <3 days in women undergoing elective gynecologic surgery, using targeted quantitative polymerase chain reaction and an untargeted 16S rRNA taxonomic screen.
Results
Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Enterococcus spp were found on virtually all catheters and lactic acid bacteria in most catheters regardless of duration, but neither genus was associated with UTI development during follow-up. Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus were the most commonly identified genera in the taxonomic screen but were not associated with subsequent UTIs. Although the most common cause of UTI following catheter removal was Escherichia coli, detectable E coli on the catheter surface was not associated with subsequent UTIs.
Conclusions
Our analysis does not suggest that the presence of bacteria on the surface of catheters placed for <3 days leads to subsequent UTIs. Other aspects of catheter care are likely more important than preventing bacterial colonization of the catheter surface for preventing UTIs following short-term catheter placement."

This study was a prospective study with interventions made between January 1, 2018, and January 1, 2019. Cultures were reviewed to ensure appropriate antimicrobial coverage. The objective was to compare outcomes with accepted versus rejected interventions. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize data.
Results
A total of 7,360 antibiotic orders were reviewed by the infectious diseases pharmacists. Pharmacists intervened on 20.1% (n = 194) of encounters with related cultures. Interventions were most frequent in the emergency department (42%). Ciprofloxacin required the most interventions (26%), followed by third-generation cephalosporins (22%). The intervention acceptance rate was 76%, which was associated with decreased rates of 30-day treatment failure (5% vs 28%, P < .001) and 30-day admission (0.7% vs 11%, P = .001), when interventions were accepted rather than rejected.
Discussion
Approximately 20% of patients required intervention. Culture review services may be beneficial in a variety of outpatient settings. Outpatient stewardship literature is limited, and our study found a decrease in admission and treatment failure.
Conclusions
Microbiology review and intervention positively impacted care for outpatients. Intervention was associated with significantly decreased rates of treatment failure and admission when interventions were accepted."

We review the impact of the consequences of operating room (OR) management decision making on power analyses for observational studies of surgical site infections (SSIs) among patients receiving care in ORs with interventions versus without interventions involving physical changes to ORs. Examples include ventilation systems, bactericidal lighting, and physical alterations to ORs.
Methods
We performed a narrative review of operating room management and surgical site infection articles. We used 10-years of operating room data to estimate parameters for use in statistical power analyses.
Results
Creating pivot tables or monthly control charts of SSI per case by OR and comparing among ORs with or without intervention is not recommended. This approach has low power to detect a difference in SSI rates among the ORs with or without the intervention. The reason is that appropriate OR case scheduling decision making causes risk factors for SSI to differ among ORs, even when stratifying by surgical specialty. Such risk factors include case duration, urgency, and American Society of Anesthesiologists’ Physical Status. Instead, analyze SSI controlling for the OR, where the patient had surgery, and matching patients using these variables is preferable. With α = 0.05, 600 cases per OR, 5 intervention ORs, and 5 or 1 control patients for each intervention patient, reasonable power (≅94% or 78%, respectively) can be achieved to detect reductions (3.6% to 2.4%) in the incidence of SSI between ORs with or without the intervention.
Conclusions
By using this matched cohort design, the effect of the purchase and installation of capital equipment in ORs on SSI can be evaluated meaningfully."

abstract = "Background
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is a primary strategy to protect health care personnel (HCP) from infectious diseases. When transmission-based PPE ensembles are not appropriate, HCP must recognize the transmission pathway of the disease and anticipate the exposures to select PPE. Because guidance for this process is extremely limited, we proposed a systematic, risk-based approach to the selection and evaluation of PPE ensembles to protect HCP against infectious diseases.
Methods
The approach used in this study included the following 4 steps: (1) job hazard analysis, (2) infectious disease hazard analysis, (3) selection of PPE, and (4) evaluation of selected PPE. Selected PPE should protect HCP from exposure, be usable by HCP, and fit for purpose.
Results
The approach was demonstrated for the activity of intubation of a patient with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus. As expected, the approach led to the selection of different ensembles of PPE for these 2 pathogens.
Discussion
A systematic risk-based approach to the selection of PPE will help health care facilities and HCP select PPE when transmission-based precautions are not appropriate. Owing to the complexity of PPE ensemble selection and evaluation, a team with expertise in infectious diseases, occupational health, the health care activity, and related disciplines, such as human factors, should be engaged.
Conclusions
Participation, documentation, and transparency are necessary to ensure the decisions can be communicated, critiqued, and understood by HCP."

abstract = "Background
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is common in medical institutions. We sought to examine the prevalence of S aureus on environmental surfaces in nursing homes and to obtain molecular information on contaminating strains.
Methods
A total of 259 environmental samples were collected from 7 different nursing homes in Northeast Ohio (NEO), from suburban, urban, and rural settings. The presence of the mecA and PVL genes was determined, and spa typing was performed in order to identify molecular types.
Results
The prevalence of S aureus was 28.6% (74/259). The prevalence of MRSA and methicillin-susceptible S aureus was 20.1% (52/259) and 8.5% (22/259), respectively. S aureus contamination in suburban, urban, and rural sites was 25.7% (38/148), 45.9% (34/74), and 5.4% (2/37), respectively. MRSA was detected in 16.9% (25/148) of suburban samples and 36.5% (27/74) of urban samples. No MRSA was found in rural samples. Nursing homes from urban areas had a significantly higher (P < .001) prevalence of S aureus compared to nursing homes from suburban and rural sites. Areas with high nurse touch rates were the most commonly contaminated.
Conclusions
We found differences in the prevalence of S aureus and MRSA in nursing homes in different regions of NEO. Part of these differences may result from transfers from hospitals; the urban nursing homes had 4 to 15 hospitals nearby, whereas suburban and rural locations had 1 to 3 hospitals within the area."

Carpal tunnel release (CTR) is increasingly performed in a clinic-based procedure room (PR) environment, which is less restrictive than traditional operating rooms (ORs). It is unknown if there is an impact on surgical site infection (SSI) rates.
Methods
Records of patients who underwent clean, elective CTR from October 2014 to April 2017 at a single site were identified using Current Procedural Terminology codes and charts reviewed using National Healthcare Safety Network SSI criteria. Procedure type and patient characteristics were assessed with multivariate logistic regression and costs compared using administrative data.
Results
A total of 312 procedures were included: 221 in OR and 91 in PR. SSI rate, including revisions, was 2.88% (nonrevision rate was 2.30%). Unadjusted SSI rate was 3.2% in OR and 2.2% in PR (P = .64). After adjusting for underlying risk factors, procedure setting was not associated with risk of SSI (P = .53; odds ratio, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.03-5.94). Revision CTR was a predictor of SSI (P = .02; odds ratio, 28.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.84-434.57). The mean total cost of CTR in the OR was $4,254.21 and PR was $416.93.
Conclusions
There was no significant difference in SSI rates for CTR performed in OR and PR environments. CTRs performed in a PR led to a 10-fold cost savings. Based on our findings of PRs as both safe and cost-effective, we recommend that more facilities explore the use of PRs for CTR."

Methods
Fingertip touch culture plates were obtained from 40 HCWs in which all HCWs used antimicrobial soap containing 0.6% chloroxylenol for handwashing according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for the entire study, while continuing to use the 70% ethanol-based hand sanitizer according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for the first week. After the first week, the test subjects used the BZK hand sanitizer in place of the ethanol sanitizer. A paired sample t test was conducted to compare the mean bacterial colonies grown from HCWs fingertips during the use of the BZK and ethanol hand sanitizer.
Results
The results showed a significant reduction in total bacterial colony counts of S aureus during the week of BZK use as compared with the week of 70% ethanol sanitizer use.

Infection control practice compliance is commonly monitored by measuring hand hygiene compliance. The limitations of this approach were recognized in 1 acute health care organization that led to the development of an Infection Control Continuous Quality Improvement tool.
Methods
The Pronovost cycle, Barriers and Mitigation tool, and Hexagon framework were used to review the existing monitoring system and develop a quality improvement data collection tool that considered the context of care delivery.
Results
Barriers and opportunities for improvement including ambiguity, consistency and feasibility of expectations, the environment, knowledge, and education were combined in a monitoring tool that was piloted and modified in response to feedback. Local adaptations enabled staff to prioritize and monitor issues important in their own workplace. The tool replaced the previous system and was positively evaluated by auditors. Challenges included ensuring staff had time to train in use of the tool, time to collect the audit, and the reporting of low scores that conflicted with a target-based performance system.
Conclusions
Hand hygiene compliance monitoring alone misses other important aspects of infection control compliance. A continuous quality improvement tool was developed reflecting specific organizational needs that could be transferred or adapted to other organizations."

Central venous catheters (CVCs) are essential for treating cancer patients, but infection is a risk associated with their use, particularly by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. The aim of this study was to describe the microbiology of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) in cancer patients and to compare the prevalence of MDR ESKAPE microorganisms (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus spp, Klebsiella spp, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp) plus Escherichia coli (E2SKAPE).
Methods
Based on data from 2013 to 2015 from a prospective survey of CRBSIs by the intravenous therapy team, we describe the microbiology and compare the prevalence of MDR E2SKAPE strains between hospitalized patients and outpatients.
Results
A total of 469 episodes of CRBSI were diagnosed: 261 (62%) were in women; 87 (18.6%) occurred in hospitalized patients, and 382 (81.4%) in ambulatory patients; 27.5% of patients had a hematologic malignancy and 72.5% a solid tumor. The median time between CVC insertion and CRBSI was 116 days (interquartile range [IQR], 48-207). The most common bacteria isolated were Staphylococcus epidermidis (18.1%), S aureus (10.9%), E coli (7.7%), and Klebsiella spp (8.6%). E2SKAPE accounted for 35.6%. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (odds ratio [OR], 16.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-114; P = .01), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Klebsiella spp (OR, 26; 95% CI, 2-286; P = .007), and ESBL E coli (OR, 26; 95% CI, 2-286; P = .007) were significantly more frequently isolated from hospitalized vs ambulatory patients.
Conclusions
MRSA, ESBL E. coli and ESBL Klebsiella spp were significantly more frequently isolated from hospitalized patients with CRBSI."

Previous decades have witnessed a change in the epidemiology of Clostridium difficile infections. This study aimed to determine temporal trends in the incidence of C difficile infection across geographic regions.
Methods
An initial search of the relevant literature was conducted from date inception to October 2018 without language restriction. We estimated the pooled incidences using logit transformation, weighted by inverse variance. The Joinpoint Regression Analysis Program was used to explore its temporal trend.
Results
Globally, the estimated incidence of C difficile infection increased from 6.60 per 10,000 patient-days in 1997 to 13.8 per 10,000 patient-days in 2004. Thereafter, a significant downward trend was observed, at –8.75% annually until 2015. From 2005 to 2015, the incidences in most European countries decreased at a rate between 1.97% and 4.11% per annum, except in France, where an increasing incidence was observed (β = 0.16; P < .001). The incidences have stabilized in North America over the same period; however, in Asia, the incidence increased significantly from 2006 to 2014 (annualized percentage change = 14.4%; P < .001). The increase was greatest in Western Asian countries, including Turkey and Israel (β > 0.10; P < .004).
Conclusions
This study revealed rapid changes in the incidence of C difficile infection. This meta-analysis should inform the allocation of resources for controlling C difficile infection and future surveillance efforts in countries where epidemiologic information on C difficile infection remains sparse."

Methods
This study was an exploratory cross-sectional survey. A total of 339 nurses from 9 general hospitals and 3 tertiary hospitals located in 3 South Korean cities were selected. Hierarchical regression was used to examine the effects of sociodemographic, individual, and institutional factors.
Results
A higher, or positive, attitude was the strongest influencing factor in adherence to SPs in the final model, followed by administrative support, hospital types, and safety climate, in descending order. These 4 variables accounted for 26.0% of the variance in adherence to SPs.
Conclusions
The attitudes of nurses toward SPs is important for increasing the adherence to SP best practices. The adherence of nurses to SPs will improve if safe environments are created in different hospital types and if managerial support and administrative efforts are supportive and sustained."

abstract = "Background
Currently, powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) are not recommended for usage in close proximity to sterile fields owing to concerns that exhaled, unfiltered air potentially may cause contamination; however, this has not been confirmed by experimental study.
Methods
After establishing background levels of airborne contamination, our team placed settling plates in a sterile field and collected contamination from participants who were performing particulate-generating actions. Participants performed the actions while wearing various forms of respiratory protection, including: (1) a full facepiece PAPR, (2) a full facepiece PAPR with a shoulder-length hood, (3) a surgical mask, and (4) no facial covering (as a positive control to determine contamination-reduction effectiveness). Specimens were collected at the end of a 10-minute sampling time frame. After incubation at 36.5˚C for 72 hours, we tabulated colony forming units as a marker of contamination.
Results
Surgical masks and the 2 PAPR configurations all drastically reduced aerosolized droplet contamination. Surgical masks reduced contamination by 98.48%, and both PAPRs reduced contamination by 100% (compared with the usage of no facial covering). There was no statistical difference between their effectiveness (surgical mask vs both PAPRs, P value = .588 and no hood PAPR vs hood PAPR, P value >.999).
Discussion/Conclusions
Based on these findings, the tested PAPR configurations are effective at reducing aerosolized droplet contamination into a sterile field, and further testing is warranted to assess other PAPR configurations as well as PAPR suitability in an operating room."

Cross-contamination from inanimate surfaces can play a significant role in intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired colonization and infection. This study assessed an innovative isopropyl alcohol/organofunctional silane solution (IOS) to reduce microbial contamination on inert surfaces in a medical ICU.
Methods
Baseline adenosine triphosphate bioluminescence testing (ABT)-measurements (N = 200) were obtained on designated inert ICU surfaces followed by IOS treatment. At 1 and 6 weeks, selective surfaces were randomized to either IOS-treated or nontreated controls for comparison using ABT (N = 400) and RODAC colony counts (N = 400). An ABT value of ≤45 relative light units (RLU) was designated as “clean,” whereas >45 was assessed as “dirty.”
Results
Mean RLU baseline values ranged from 870.3 (computer keyboard) to 201.6 (bed table), and 97.5% of surfaces were assessed as “dirty.” At 6 weeks, the mean RLU of surfaces treated with IOS ranged from 31.7 (physician workstation) to 51.5 (telephone handpiece), whereas values on comparative control surfaces were 717.3 and 643.7, respectively (P < .001). Some 95.5% of RODAC cultures from IOS-treated sites at 6 weeks were negative, whereas 90.5% of nontreated sites were culture-positive, yielding multiple isolates including multidrug-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
Conclusions
IOS-treated surfaces recorded significantly lower RLU and RODAC colony counts compared with controls (P < .001). A single application of IOS resulted in a persistent antimicrobial activity on inert ICU surfaces over the 6-week study interval."

Central line–associated bloodstream infections may be due to catheter connector colonization and intraluminal migration of pathogens. We assessed the colonization of the split septum catheter connector system, and subsequently the luer lock catheter connector system.
Methods
This was a prospective, 2 phase, quality improvement study at a tertiary referral center. Each phase of the study was performed over 3 consecutive days in hospitalized patients receiving an active infusion; first with a split septum lever lock connector and second with a luer lock connector and alcohol port protector. The connectors were inoculated onto blood agar plates and incubated. Plates were assessed for microbial growth after 48-72 hours.
Results
In phase I, 98 (41.9%) of 234 split septum connectors yielded microbial growth. In phase II, 56 (23.1%) of 243 luer lock connectors yielded microbial growth. In phase II only, there was a significant increased rate of contamination in peripheral catheters compared with all other catheters, and the rate of contamination on the acute care wards was significantly higher when compared with the intensive care units.
Conclusions
Bacterial colonization of the lever lock system was unacceptably high among all catheter types and hospital locations. Transition to luer lock catheter connectors and alcohol port protectors decreased the colonization; however, colonization still remained substantial. Causation of colonization cannot be determined with these results."

A high prevalence of working while ill (presenteeism) has been documented among health care workers (HCWs). However, previous evidence is primarily based on nonspecific causes of sickness and self-reported data. Our study examined presenteeism among HCWs with laboratory-confirmed influenza.
Methods
The data pertaining to laboratory-confirmed influenza cases and history of sick leave among HCWs in Queensland, Australia, were collected from 2009-2015. The incidence and duration of sick leave around the time of disease confirmation were analyzed. The associations of factors, such as job category and employment status, on presenteeism were assessed with regression analyses.
Results
The overall sick leave incidence was 85.9% in the laboratory-confirmed periods, which translates that 14.1% of HCWs were working while ill with influenza. Among medical doctors, approximately one-quarter of them were attending work in the period. A shorter duration of leave was also observed among medical doctors and full-time employees compared with other HCWs and part-time employees.
Conclusions
Presenteeism among HCWs with influenza put both HCWs and patients at risk by increasing potential for transmission. Our findings emphasize the importance of an integrated approach including both HCW sick leave management and vaccination for strategic prevention and control of nosocomial influenza infection."

Hand hygiene is the most important intervention to reduce the risk of transmission of pathogens in health care. Assurance of effective hand hygiene improvement campaigns includes adequate data analytics for reporting compliance. Traditional analytical approaches for monitoring hand hygiene compliance suffer from several limitations, including autocorrelation. The objective of this study was to use a novel time series anomaly detection algorithm to analyze routine hand hygiene compliance data.
Methods
Hand hygiene compliance data were collected daily by trained observers in a large academic medical center. Statistical process control p-charts were used as a comparison method of analysis per facility protocol. Time series anomaly detection was carried out using the seasonal and trend decomposition using LOESS (STL) algorithm.
Results
A total of 34 months of hand hygiene compliance data were analyzed. Traditional statistical process control p-charts identified over 76% of rates as special-cause variation, whereas STL identified 18% of rates as anomalous.
Conclusions
This study supports the use of time series anomaly detection for the routine surveillance of hand hygiene compliance data. This method will facilitate specific and accurate feedback, helping to improve this critical approach for improving patient safety."

Increased percentage of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients in June 2016 was observed. P aeruginosa were also obtained from flexible bronchoscope and rinse water in the microbiological surveillance in June 2016.
Methods
Reprocessing procedure of bronchoscope was assessed, and environmental samples were collected. P aeruginosa isolates recovered from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients between May and September 2016 and environment were characterized using multilocus sequence typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
Results
A novel multilocus sequence type (ST) of P aeruginosa was defined as ST 2387. ST671 and ST 2387 were both cultured from bronchoscopes and connecting tube in manual reprocessing cleaning equipment. One strain from a patient was indistinguishable from the clones obtained from the bronchoscope and connecting tube revealed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Two strains from 2 patients from the burn intensive care unit were identical, and highly related to 2 other strains from the burn intensive care unit. The persistence of P aeruginosa in bronchoscopes, connecting tubes, and final rinse water was terminated by replacement of the connecting tube.
Conclusions
We report a pseudo-outbreak of P aeruginosa associated with bronchoscope, for which connecting tube was the hidden reservoir for contaminating bronchoscopes. This highlights that effective measures are needed to control the bacterial load in final rinsing water to protect reusable equipment from contamination in reprocessing and cleaning."

abstract = "Background
For the prevention of surgical wound infections (SSIs), local microorganism counts can be lowered by skin antisepsis prior to surgical incisions. Until now, it has been unclear which antiseptic is the most effective.
Methods
This prospective randomized trial analyzed the efficacy of 2 frequently used agents in the reduction of postoperative wound complication rates after aseptic trauma surgery on the lower leg and foot. In the study, 279 consecutive participants were randomized; 112 received surgical skin preparations using chlorhexidine (CHX) (ChloraPrep; Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and 167 received preparations with povidone-iodine (PVP-I) (Braunoderm; B. Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany). Primary clinical endpoints were SSIs and wound healing disorders (WHDs) within 6 months after surgery. Secondary outcome variables included demographic and perioperative risk factors for SSIs.
Results
Rates of WHDs and SSIs were significantly higher in the PVP-I treatment group, which experienced 9 SSIs and 12 WHDs (n = 21; 12.6%), compared to the CHX treatment group, which had 2 SSIs and 3 WHDs (n = 5; 4.5%) (P = .022). Perioperative risk factors for WHDs were obesity and longer surgery time, whereas SSIs were increased in participants with cardiovascular diseases and suction drainage. Logistic regression analysis showed that the odds of complications of wound healing were 3.5 times higher for PVP-I than for CHX (odds ratio = 3.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-11.2; P = .032).
Conclusions
Preoperative skin antisepsis for trauma surgery of the lower leg and foot using CHX led to significantly fewer complications of wound healing when compared to PVP-I."

Clinical studies support a standing orders program (SOP) to improve vaccine uptake. We aimed to examine the potential cost-effectiveness of a pneumococcal vaccination SOP for Hong Kong elderly in a hospital setting.
Methods
A decision-analytic model was designed to compare the outcomes of inpatients 65 years of age or older who were eligible for pneumococcal vaccination. Two vaccination approaches were evaluated: (1) vaccination SOP, and (2) no program (control group). Outcome measures included direct medical costs, invasive pneumococcal disease–associated mortality rates, quality-adjusted life year (QALY) losses, and incremental cost per QALY saved (ICER).
Results
In the base-case analysis, mortality and QALY losses were lower and costs were higher in the SOP group when compared to the control group. The base-case ICER of the SOP group was $59,762 (all dollar amounts are in US$) per QALY saved. One-way sensitivity analyses found ICER to be sensitive to the probability of invasive pneumococcal disease among the unvaccinated elderly. Using 1× the gross domestic product per capita of Hong Kong ($43,497) and the United States ($150,000) as willingness-to-pay thresholds, SOPs were the preferred option in 37.2% and 97.5% of 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations, respectively.
Conclusions
The pneumococcal vaccination SOP for hospitalized elderly patients appeared to reduce QALY losses at a higher cost. The cost-effective acceptance of SOPs is highly dependent on the willingness-to-pay threshold."

The annual Exposure Survey of Trends in Occupational Practice (EXPO-S.T.O.P.), conducted by the Association of Occupational Health Professionals in Healthcare, provides a U.S. national overview of sharps injuries (SIs) and mucocutaneous exposures (MCEs). This study presents the 2016 and 2017 surveys.
Methods
An 18-item survey was distributed to Association of Occupational Health Professionals in Healthcare members and colleagues and requested total SIs and MCEs; SI in nurses, doctors, and surgery; staffed beds; teaching status; full-time equivalent staff (FTE), nurse FTE, and average daily census (ADC).
Results
In 2016, 170 hospitals reported 10,271 exposures (72.9% SIs); in 2017, 224 hospitals reported 12,672 exposures (74.4% SIs). In 2016, SI rates were 27.0 per 100 ADC, 2.3 per 100 FTE, and 2.8 per 100 nurse FTE. Of the total SIs, 36.4% were nurses, 35.6% were doctors, and 39.0% occurred during surgery. In 2017, the respective SI rates were 27.7 per 100 ADC, 2.5 per 100 FTE, and 2.7 per 100 nurse FTE. Of the total SIs, 37.6% were nurses, 32.7% were doctors, and 39.9% occurred during surgery. In 2016, MCE rates were 11.2 per 100 ADC and 0.82 per 100 FTE, and in 2017, MCE rates were 9.6 per 100 ADC and 0.87 per 100 FTE. Teaching hospitals had higher rates than nonteaching hospitals.
Discussion
EXPO-S.T.O.P. SI rates have risen year-on-year for 3 years and now match 2001-2005 levels.
Conclusions
There is an urgent need for aggressive SI-reduction strategies, including leadership support, safety-engineered devices (SED) training/education, and adoption of safer, less user-dependent SED. Further research on SI mechanisms, SED effectiveness, and reduction strategies is required."

Quantitative tools are needed to relate infection control interventions to infection risk reductions.
Methods
A model for predicting virus concentrations on hands was used to predict rotavirus, rhinovirus, and influenza A virus doses. Variability in behaviors, transfer efficiencies for various contact types, and surface areas of contact were included. Dose-response curves were used to relate estimated doses to infection risks. Percent reductions from baseline in average rotavirus, rhinovirus, and influenza A virus dose and infection risk were calculated for interventions.
Results
Baseline average infection risks for rotavirus, rhinovirus, and influenza A virus were 0.43, 0.20, and 5.51 × 10−6, respectively. One and 2 cleaning events decreased average viral infection risks by 6.98%-17.06% and 13.95%-34.66%, respectively. A 15% increase in hand compliance decreased average infection risks by 6.98%-20.51%. A 15% increase in hand hygiene compliance paired with 2 cleaning events decreased average infection risks by 20.93%-47.55%.
Discussion
This study demonstrates the infection risk benefits of combined interventions.
Conclusions
Models such as the one in this study could be used to optimize timing and frequency of cleaning events and to create hand hygiene compliance goals to achieve infection risk targets."

Hand hygiene compliance (HHC) among health care workers remains suboptimal, and good monitoring systems are lacking. We aimed to evaluate HHC using an automated monitoring system.
Methods
A prospective, observational study was conducted at 2 Danish university hospitals employing a new monitoring system (Sani nudge). Sensors were located on alcohol-based sanitizers, health care worker name tags, and patient beds measuring hand hygiene opportunities and sanitations.
Results
In total, 42 nurses were included with an average HHC of 52% and 36% in hospitals A and B, respectively. HHC was lowest in patient rooms (hospital A: 45%; hospital B: 29%) and highest in staff toilets (hospital A: 72%; hospital B: 91%). Nurses sanitized after patient contact more often than before, and sanitizers located closest to room exits and in hallways were used most frequently. There was no association found between HHC level and the number of beds in patient rooms. The HHC level of each nurse was consistent over time, and showed a positive correlation between the number of sanitations and HHC levels (hospital A: r = 0.69; hospital B: r = 0.58).
Conclusions
The Sani nudge system can be used to monitor HHC at individual and group levels, which increases the understanding of compliance behavior."

Antibiotic stewardship in nursing homes (NHs) is a high priority owing to intense antibiotic use and increased risk of adverse events. Updated Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services regulations required NHs to establish antibiotic stewardship programs (ASPs). This study describes the current state of NH ASPs.
Methods
A nationally representative survey of NHs was conducted in 2018. ASP comprehensiveness, infection preventionist (IP) training, participation in Quality Innovation Network-Quality Improvement Organization (QIN-QIO) activities, and facility and staff characteristics were analyzed using weighted descriptive statistics and multinomial regression models.
Results
Of 861 NHs, 33.2% (6-7) had “comprehensive” ASP policies, 41.1% (4-5) had “moderately comprehensive” ASP policies, and 25.6% (≤ 3) had “not comprehensive” ASP policies. Data collection on antibiotic use was most reported (91.4%), and restricting use of specific antibiotics was least reported (19.0%). Comprehensive ASPs were associated with QIN-QIO involvement; moderate and comprehensive ASPs were associated with IP training and high occupancy.
Discussion
Immediately following Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services regulation changes, a majority of NHs had moderately comprehensive or comprehensive ASPs. Rates for each policy and infection control-trained IPs increased from previous studies.
Conclusions
NH ASPs are becoming more comprehensive. Infection control training and partnerships with QIN-QIOs can support NHs to increase ASP comprehensiveness."

Central line–associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are preventable health care–associated infections that can lead to increased mortality. Therefore, we investigated trends in CLABSI rates, and the factors associated with changing trends over a 10-year period using the Korean National Healthcare-associated Infections Surveillance System (KONIS).
Methods
We investigated annual CLABSI rates from 2006 to 2015 in 190 KONIS-participating intensive care units (ICUs) from 107 participating hospitals. We collected data associated with hospital and ICU characteristics and analyzed trends using generalized autoregressive moving average models.
Results
The CLABSI pooled mean rate decreased from 3.40 in 2006 to 2.20 in 2015 (per 1,000 catheter-days). The trend analysis also showed a significant decreasing trend in CLABSI rates in unadjusted models (annual increase, –0.137; P < .001). After adjusting for hospital and ICU characteristics, significant decreasing trends were identified (annual increase, –0.109; P < .001). However, there were no significant changes in subgroups with non-university-affiliated hospitals, hospitals in metropolitan areas near Seoul, small hospitals (300-699 beds), or surgical ICUs.
Conclusions
In South Korea, CLABSI rates have shown significant reductions in the past 10 years with participation in the KONIS. However, CLABSI rates may be reduced by encouraging more hospitals to participate in the KONIS and by improved policy support for hospitals lacking infection control resources."

There is a paucity of research on best practices for communication through the electronic health record (EHR) to support shared decision-making and to prevent adverse events. To explore this issue, this study focused on interprofessional communication around a specific clinical issue, the prevention of central line–associated bloodstream infections.
Methods
The Delphi technique was used to describe what information is needed to support decisions regarding central venous catheter (CVC) management, and best practices for communicating this information among the interprofessional team.
Results
The expert panel, 4 physicians and 6 nurses, identified 12 information types necessary for decisions regarding CVC management and the removal of unnecessary lines. For each of the 12 information types, the panel reached agreement regarding the best channel to communicate this information, including asynchronous EHR formats and synchronous oral channels.
Conclusions
Findings address 2 important aspects of postinsertion CVC practices and a gap in the literature by moving beyond a description of current practices to a description of how the EHR ought to be used to support collaboration and interprofessional communication. Future research should examine how the communication practices identified in this study contribute to a reduction in central line–associated bloodstream infections."

There is limited knowledge regarding the risk factors for influenza B virus–associated pneumonia in adults. This study aimed to determine the risk factors for influenza B virus–associated pneumonia in adults.
Methods
We used viral surveillance data during the pandemic season between November 2017 and April 2018 from the University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital medical record database. The files of patients ages 18 years or older were reviewed for demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and outcome. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with influenza B virus–associated pneumonia.
Results
A total of 78 patients with influenza B, ages 20 to 87 years, were identified. Comparing cases with pneumonia vs cases without pneumonia, there were significant differences in the following: age in years (67.41 ± 16.63 vs 58.16 ± 17.65; P = .028), age group (74.1% vs 51.0%; P = .049), chronic respiratory diseases (70.4% vs 21.6%; P = .000), shortness of breath (40.7% vs13.7%; P = .007), abnormal breath sounds on auscultation (51.9% vs 21.6%; P = .006), and serum alanine transaminase level (30.07 ± 10.73 vs 38.64 ± 21.68; P = .022). Logistic regression models indicated that chronic respiratory diseases (odds ratio, 8.452; 95% confidence interval, 2.768-25.808; P = .000) and shortness of breath (odds ratio, 1.261; 95% confidence interval, 1.015-1.566; P = .036) were independent risk factors.

Isolation of patients with multidrug-resistant organisms has been recommended in several guidelines. Recent evidence has suggested potential negative effects of isolation on patient well-being and facility throughput. Published literature shows a difference in transmission risk of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms, suggesting that contact precautions may not be necessary for all ESBL-positive organisms.
Methods
Incidence rates of health care–associated ESBL organisms were measured before and after eliminating the use of contact precautions for patients with only ESBL-positive organisms. The National Healthcare Safety Network surveillance methodology was used to measure incidence. Surgical site infections and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were excluded from the surveillance incidence.
Results
The incidence of health care–associated ESBL infections from January 2014 through November 2015 was 3.71 per 10,000 patient days. The incidence from December 2015 through August 2017 was 3.00 per 10,000 patient days. This rate change was statistically significant (P = .022)
Conclusions
This study found that discontinuing the use of contact precautions for patients colonized or infected with ESBL-positive organisms did not lead to an increased rate of health care–associated ESBL-positive infections or colonization."

Social media not only provide platforms for the public to obtain information about a disease but also allow them to share their opinions and experiences about it.
Methods
This study analyzed 3000 tweets systematically selected from over 1 million tweets posted during the 2015 California measles outbreak.
Results
News updates were the most tweeted messages (41.4%), followed by personal opinions (33.7%), resources (19.4%), personal experiences (2.5%), and questions (1.6%). Susceptibility was the most discussed health belief (21.8%), followed by cues to action (18.9%) and severity (13.0%). Individuals were significantly more likely to discuss severity. Nonprofit organizations were significantly more likely to offer cues to action than other user types, and media were less likely to include cues to action than other user types. Pro-vaccine tweets were more likely to contain links to traditional mainstream media sources such as newspapers and magazines, and anti-vaccine tweets were more likely to link to emerging news websites.
Conclusions
Understanding who posts what on social media during an infectious disease outbreak allows public health agencies to better assess the public's attitudes, sentiments, and needs in order to provide timely and effective information."

Years of global antibiotic misuse has led to the progression of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), posing a direct threat to public health. To impact AMR and maintain antimicrobial viability, educational interventions toward fostering positive AMR behavior change have been employed with some success.
Methods
This scoping review sought to identify research-supporting use of public educational AMR campaigns, and their efficacy toward informing positive AMR behaviors to inform current debate. To enable credible and reflexive examination of a wide variety of literature, Arksey and O'Malley's (2005) methodological framework was used.
Results
Three primary themes were identified: (1) behavior change and theoretical underpinnings, (2) intervention paradigm, and (3) educational engagement. From 94 abstracts identified, 31 articles were chosen for review. More attention is required to identify elements of intervention design that inform and sustain behavior change, and the impact of how an intervention is delivered and targeted is needed to limit assumptions of population homogeneity, which potentially limits intervention efficacy. Moreover, research on the impact of hospital-based inpatient interventions is needed.
Conclusions
The existing body of research fails to provide robust evidence to support sound evidential interventions supported by theoretical justifications. Furthermore, interventions to ensure long-term sustained behavior change are unclear and not addressed."

Surveillance of health care-associated, catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) are the corner stone of infection prevention activity. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network provides standard definitions for CAUTI surveillance, which have been updated periodically to increase objectivity, credibility, and reliability of urinary tract infection definitions. Several state health departments have validated CAUTI data that provided insights into accuracy of CAUTI reporting and adherence to CAUTI definition.
Methods
Data accuracy measures included pooled mean sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Total CAUTI error rate was computed as proportion of mismatches among total records. The impact of 2015 CAUTI definition changes were tested by comparing pooled accuracy estimates of validations prior to 2015 with post-2015.
Results
At least 19 state health departments conducted CAUTI validations and indicated pooled mean sensitivity of 88.3%, specificity of 98.8%, positive predictive value of 93.6%, and negative predictive value of 97.6% of CAUTI reporting to the National Healthcare Safety Network. Among CAUTIs misclassified (121), 66% were underreported and 34% were overreported. CAUTI classification error rate declined significantly from 4.3% (pre-2015) to 2.4% (post-2015). Reasons for CAUTI misclassifications included: misapplication of CAUTI definition, misapplication of general health care–associated infection definitions, and clinical judgement over surveillance definition.
Conclusions
CAUTI underreporting is a major concern; validations provide transparency, education, and relationship building to improve reporting accuracy."

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a significant occupational hazard in health care settings and represents a public health concern. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between medical waste handling and HBV infection by conducting a meta-analysis of available evidence.
Methods
Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) of the included studies were calculated, using the random-effects model, for medical waste handlers versus non-medical waste handlers. Publication bias was detected using the regression test for funnel plot asymmetry, and quality assessment was conducted according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.
Results
Nine cross-sectional studies, published between 1992 and 2018, were included. Medical waste handling was associated with higher odds of HBV infection compared to non-medical waste handling (pooled OR = 2.88; 95% CI, 1.40-5.93; I2 = 61.36%; P value for heterogeneity = .008). Subgroup analysis showed higher odds of HBV infection in studies conducted in Africa (pooled OR = 3.61; 95% CI, 1.19-11.00). Most studies were of poor to fair quality; yet, little evidence of publication bias was detected (P value for publication bias = .983). No single study showed a substantial impact on the pooled results.
Conclusions
The present meta-analysis supports the suggestion that medical waste handling is associated with HBV infection. This association was shown to be more obvious in African health care settings."

Despite increased awareness of infection control precautions, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) still spreads through patients and contaminated objects, causing a substantial burden of illness and cost. Our objective was to define risk factors for contracting MRSA in a tertiary health care facility using a historic case-control study and to validate health care network changes during pre-outbreak and outbreak periods.
Methods
We conducted a case-control study using secondary data on hospitalizations where infected or colonized cases were compared with matched controls who tested negative by age, sex, and campus over 1 year. Social networks of all cases and controls were built from links joining patients to rooms, roommates, and health care providers over time.
Results
Matched controls were similar to cases in comorbidity, lengths of stay, mortality, and number of roommates, rooms, and health care providers. As expected, the number of rooms and roommates increased in the outbreak by more than 50%. A timed animation of the network at one campus identified potential source patients linked to 2 rooms and many roommates, after which cases connected to those same rooms proliferated.
Conclusions
Only the network animation over time revealed possible transmission of MRSA through the network, rather than attributes measured in the traditional case control study."

Microorganisms causing catheter-related bloodstream infections colonize to intravenous catheters (IVC)—particularly to connectors mounted to catheters. The aim of this study was to examine the colonization in 3-way stopcock (TWS) connectors and needleless connectors (NCs) that integrated into central, port, and peripheral venous catheters.
Methods
This random, experimental study consisted of 180 connectors that were inserted into the IVCs of patients in general surgery, reanimation intensive care, and daily chemotherapy units. Cultures of the connectors were obtained at least 48 hours after connecting to IVCs.
Results
This study showed that gram-negative, gram-positive, and other pathogens reproduced, although their colonization level was not high enough to develop an infection. When the results of colonization for patients using TWS and NC were compared, the peripheral venous catheters (using a TWS) resulted in a significantly higher increase in reproduction than in patients using NC (P ≤ .01) and no significant difference in the level of colonization in other types of connectors or catheters (P ˃ .05).
Conclusions
The study's results indicated no significant difference between NC and TWSs in terms of reproduction. It should also be noted that connectors integrated into IVC pose a risk in the development of catheter-related bloodstream infections."

Poor quality handwashing contributes to the spread of nosocomial infections. We investigate the impact of automatic video auditing (AVA) with feedback on the quality and quantity of handwashing in a hospital setting.
Methods
AVA systems were mounted over all handwash sinks in a surgical unit. Phase 1 established baseline handwashing quality and quantity. Phase 2 examined the impact of real-time performance feedback, and phase 3 examined the incremental impact of weekly team performance reports. Phase 4 remeasured the baseline without feedback.
Results
A total of 3,606 handwash events were audited. During phase 2 and 3, compliance with the World Health Organization technique improved from 15.7%-46% (P < .0001), and the average number of handwash events per patient per day increased from 0.91-2.25 (P < .0001). Performance returned to baseline in phase 4.
Conclusions
AVA with real-time feedback significantly improved the quality and quantity of handwashing. The combination of AVA with electronic monitoring will allow simultaneous auditing of hand hygiene quantity and quality. The impact of cognitive offloading onto the technology may have contributed to the return to baseline at the end of the study, and suggests further research is required in this area."

Proper handwashing technique can reduce the mortality of a child. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a school-based hand hygiene program on the handwashing compliance of children and school absenteeism in Southern Africa.
Methods
We conducted a 2-arm cluster randomized trial in which 6 private primary schools were allocated randomly to either intervention (3 schools) or control (3 schools) groups. The intervention group consisted of implementing a series of planned activities and measures of hand hygiene program over 9 months. Parameters of primary and secondary outcomes were estimated with generalized estimating equations.
Results
There were no significant between-group differences in demographic characteristics. The knowledge scores in the intervention group were significantly higher than the scores in the control group, and the technique scores in the intervention group were significantly higher than the scores in the control group after baseline. Further, after the third month, the cleanliness scores in the intervention group were significantly higher than the scores in the control group. In addition, the number of sick leave days decreased in the intervention group.
Conclusions
The impact of the school-based hand hygiene program was positive. It can be used in both the planning and development of a hand hygiene protocol to increase the handwashing compliance rate of schoolchildren and to reduce school absenteeism in developing countries."

The use of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) in neonates differs among various institutions and countries because there are no random controlled trials or large observational studies regarding maximal sterile barrier (MSB) precautions in neonatal intensive care units. Our objective was to investigate the association of MSB implementation with central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) in very low birth weight infants.
Methods
This was a prospective multicenter observational study in Japan of infants with birth weight less than 1501 grams and in whom a PICC was placed for the first time between October 2014 and March 2017. Risk factors for CLABSI, both related and unrelated to MSB, were assessed by the mixed-effects Cox proportional hazards model, with the neonatal center variable as the random effect.
Results
In total, 33,713 catheter-days among 2383 infants were included. We observed 70 cases of CLABSI. MSB precautions were implemented in 13.9% of insertions and were associated with a lower CLABSI risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-0.84).
Conclusions
We found that MSB implementation during PICC insertion in infants with birth weight less than 1501 grams independently contributed to a decrease in CLABSI risk."

Long-term acute care hospitals (LTACHs) have a unique patient population, with multiple risk factors for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) colonization and infection.
Methods
We performed a retrospective analysis of patients in LTACHs who were diagnosed with and treated for CRE infections. Baseline data, antimicrobial treatment, and outcomes were collected in patients with bacteremia, health care–associated pneumonia, and complicated urinary tract infection/acute pyelonephritis due to CRE diagnosed between January 2017 and December 2017.
Results
A total of 57 cases of CRE infection were identified over the study period, including 12 cases of bacteremia, 20 cases of health care–associated pneumonia, and 25 cases of complicated urinary tract infection/acute pyelonephritis. Patient had significant comorbidities: 31.5% with diabetes, 40.4% with heart failure, 29.8% with kidney disease, and 10% with solid tumors. The majority (56) of 57 patients received empiric antibiotics known to have activity against gram-negative bacteria, but only 38.6% had in vitro activity against the CRE organism in cultured specimens. A total of 78.9% of patients received monotherapy. Overall outcome was poor, with 28-day mortality across all infection sites of 17.5% in patients but up to 25% in patients with bacteremia.
Conclusions
In this retrospective analysis of our clinical experience treating CRE infections in an LTACH setting, we documented that CRE infections occur in patients with substantial comorbidities. Although clinical outcome remains of great concern, the 28-day mortality and rate of eradication of CRE in this study were comparatively better than other national estimates. Inappropriate empiric treatment may be one of many factors leading to overall poor treatment outcomes."

Invasive group A streptococcal (iGAS) infection in the peripartum setting is a rare but devastating disease occasionally occurring as a health care–associated infection (HAI). Current guidelines suggest enhanced surveillance and streptococcal isolate storage after a single case of iGAS, as well as a full epidemiological investigation that includes screening health care workers (HCWs) from several sites after 2 cases. Current guidelines do not recommend routine screening of household members of a patient with iGAS.
Methods
We conducted studies of 3 patients with iGAS puerperal sepsis and related epidemiologic and molecular investigations.
Results
Identical GAS emm gene types were found in pharyngeal cultures of 3 asymptomatic spouses of patients with iGAS puerperal sepsis. HCWs screened negative for GAS, and emm typing indicated that other iGAS cases from this hospital were sporadic and not related to the puerperal cases.
Conclusions
The concurrent presence of the same emm type in a household member practically excludes the option of an inadvertent HAI or facility outbreak. Hence, we suggest that screening close family members for asymptomatic GAS carriage should be performed early as a part of infection prevention measures, as doing so would have significant utility in saving time and resources related to a full epidemiological inquiry."

Norovirus outbreaks in health care facilities are difficult to prevent and control.
Methods
We describe a norovirus outbreak that occurred in a single pediatric ward with multi-bed rooms.
Results
The outbreak began with 4 clustered cases with acute diarrhea in a pediatric ward between December 22 and 25, 2017. A total of 10 cases were identified during the outbreak, with a cumulative incidence of 8.77%. The median age of the cases was 10 months. Symptoms lasted for a median of 7.5 days, and norovirus shed in stool for a median of 19.5 days. The first 5 cases consecutively developed diarrhea; 4 of them were in the same room. The sixth case, which was linked with the clustered cases, had stayed in the intensive care unit and infected 3 other patients during the stay. After these 4 cases were transferred back to the ward, an additional patient was infected. Strict infection control measures were implemented, and the outbreak was successfully terminated 24 days after the initial case.
Conclusions
Controlling norovirus outbreak in a pediatric ward with multi-bed rooms is challenging. Early detection of the outbreak and prompt implementation of strict infection control measures are critical."

Although the factors associated to bacterial resistance in patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) have been studied in pregnant, fertile age women, patients with spinal cord injury, and those with urogynecological disorders, nothing is known about the factors associated with multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria in patients with ASB and planned urological procedures. This study therefore sought to identify the sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with MDR bacteria in a cohort of patients with ASB scheduled for urological procedures.
Methods
We conducted a nested case–control study on a cohort of patients with ASB and planned urological procedures at 3 Colombian medical centers. Cases were patients with MDR bacteria and controls were patients without MDR bacteria.
Results
A total of 184 patients were included, 41.8% (n = 77) of whom presented ASB with MDR bacteria. The factors linking ASB with MDR bacteria were: advanced age (odds ratio, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.06) and hospitalization within the 3-month period before surgery (odds ratio, 2.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-5.21).
Conclusions
Bacterial resistance is frequent among patients with ASB and planned urological procedures. Advanced age and prior hospitalization should be borne in mind for patients with planned urological procedures because they are factors associated with the presence of MDR bacteria."

Health care personnel (HCP) use of personal protective equipment (PPE) reduces infectious disease transmission. However, PPE compliance remains low. The objective of this study was to better understand how HCP perceptions factor into PPE decision making as well as how organizational processes and the environment impact behavior.
Methods
This qualitative study used observation and focus groups at 2 medical centers. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis.
Results
The decision to use PPE and to follow precaution practices was influenced by risk perception as well as organizational and environmental factors. Perceived risk, related to certain organisms and work tasks, was considered by HCP when deciding to use PPE. Organizational processes, such as policies that were not applied uniformly, and environmental factors, such as clean versus contaminated space, also played a role in HCP PPE use.
Discussion
Because HCP seemed focused on organisms and work tasks, education on specific organisms and helping HCP think through their workflow may be more effective in conveying the importance of PPE in reducing transmission. Additionally, isolation practices should be compared across disciplines to ensure they complement, rather than contradict, one another. Assessment of the environment may help protect HCP and patients from infectious organisms.
Conclusion
Preventing the spread of infectious organisms should not depend solely on PPE use, but should also be recognized as an organizational responsibility."

The association of operative time and surgical site infection (SSI) in neurosurgery patients is unclear. We therefore, through a systematic review and meta-analysis, sought to clarify the association.
Methods
We performed a systematic search of the PubMed and Embase databases, from January 1, 1966, to December 26, 2018, for published articles. We used random effects generalized least squares regression models to combine study-specific relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), and performed a sensitivity analysis by excluding 1 study at a time to assess the stability of results and potential sources of heterogeneity. We used the Egger (from plotting to test) to assess publication bias.
Results
A total of 5 articles, with 231,915 individuals and 6,726 SSI cases, were included. The summary RR for SSI after craniotomy were 1.67 (95% CI, 1.13-2.20), with high versus low operative time, and 1.34 (95% CI, 1.15-1.53), with each 1-hour increase in operative time. On sensitivity analysis, no individual study had an excessive influence on the pooled effect. We found no evidence of publication bias by the Egger test (P = .464) and Egger's plotting.
Conclusions
Prolonged operative time can increase the SSI risk for neurosurgery patients. Intensive interventions should be taken to decrease operative duration."

Research on reducing Clostridioides difficile spore contamination of textiles via laundering is needed. We evaluated the sporicidal properties of 5 laundry chemicals and then determined the ability of a peracetic acid (PAA) laundry cycle to inactivate and/or remove spores from cotton swatches during a simulated tunnel washer (TW) process.
Methods
In phase I, spore-inoculated swatches were immersed in alkaline detergent, sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, or PAA for 8 minutes. In phase II, inoculated swatches were passed through a simulated 24-minute TW process employing 5 wash liquids. Spore survivors on swatches and in test chemical fluids in both studies were enumerated using standard microbiologic assay methods.
Results
In phase I, hypochlorite solutions achieved >5 log10 spore reductions on swatches and >3 log10 reductions for wash solutions. PAA achieved minimal spore reduction in the wash solution (0.26 log10). In phase II, the PAA equilibrium-containing process achieved a >5 log10 spore reduction on swatches. In wash solution tests, the cumulative spore reduction peaked at >3.08 log10 in the final module.
Conclusions
Sodium hypochlorite as a laundry additive is sporicidal. The cumulative effects of a TW process, coupled with a PAA bleach agent at neutral pH, may render textiles essentially free of C difficile spore contamination."

Assess the efficacy of chlorhexidine with povidone solutions as a skin disinfectant for central venous catheter (CVC) care.
Background
Central venous catheters are widely used for critically ill patients. Catheter maintenance can easily lead to a catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), which is the manifestation of a bloodstream infection (BSI) in a patient who carries a catheter or removes the catheter within 48 hours. There is no clear source of BSIs except for indwelling catheters in the blood vessels, and BSIs significantly increase the morbidity and mortality of patients. We assess the efficacy of chlorhexidine with povidone as a skin disinfectant for CVC care.
Methods
In July 2018, we searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, OVID, CNKI, SinoMed, WanFangData, CqVip, and DuXiu for publications in English and Chinese. By searching articles published before July 2018, we were able to extract data on study design, participants, antiseptics compared, sample size, and main outcomes. We conducted meta-analyses of the efficacy of chlorhexidine vs povidone solutions as a skin disinfectant for CVC care.
Results
We included 10 randomized controlled trial studies. After conducting subgroup analysis, the results indicated that chlorhexidine was significantly better than povidone in preventing CRBSIs (P = .12; I2 = 36%; risk ratio [RR] = 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29-0.85). Compared with povidone, the chlorhexidine catheterization rate of CRBSIs was reduced (P = .16; I2 = 32%; RR = 0.54; 95% CI, 0.42-0.69). There was no clear difference in the rates of skin reaction between chlorhexidine and povidone (P = .006; I2 = 87%; RR = 1.92; 95% CI, 0.55-6.72). The comparison was underpowered for BSIs without a clear source.
Conclusions
Chlorhexidine solution for CVC care may significantly reduce rates of CRBSIs and catheter colonization compared with povidone solutions. The disinfection effect of chlorhexidine-alcohol is better than that of other solutions. Because the quality of the studies evaluated is relatively low, the true effects may be different, so more evidence is needed."

Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) has emerged in health care facilities around the world. Several studies demonstrated data regarding clinical outcomes for CRE infections including death. This systematic review and meta-analysis summarized literature discussing association between CRE and mortality.
Methods
A systematic literature review was performed by searching EMBASE, International Pharmaceutical Abstract databases, PubMed, and Scopus and to identify studies that assessed the association between CRE and death published from April 2012 to October 2017. A meta-analysis was performed using a random effect model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2-statistic.
Results
Twenty-one studies were included in this meta-analysis. The underlying populations were moderately heterogeneous (I2 = 60%; P = .01). Pooled risk estimates from 9 studies revealed a significant association between CRE and death (pooled-adjusted odds ratio: 2.85; 95% confidence interval: 1.88, 4.30). The unadjusted variable pooled from 18 studies demonstrated a significant association between CRE and death (pooled-unadjusted odds ratio: 3.73; 95% confidence interval: 2.02, 6.88).
Discussion
The finding that CRE infection was positively associated with death agreed with the previous meta-analysis of studies published before April 2012.
Conclusions
This meta-analysis found that CRE was associated with increased risk of death. Our analysis implies a need for strict infection control measures."

Gram-negative organisms (GNOs) have increasing resistance rates to levofloxacin at Virginia Commonwealth University Health System (VCUHS), where levofloxacin is the most common agent added to provide double coverage of gram-negative infections. The goal of this study was to determine the adequacy of empiric gram-negative coverage for septic patients at our institution.
Methods
A retrospective review of patients admitted to VCUHS, from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2014, with a diagnosis of sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock and documented infection, was performed to determine the adequacy of various empiric antibiotic combinations.
Results
Of 219 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 56% of patients received monotherapy and 21% of patients received combination therapy (2 antibiotics) covering GNOs. GNOs (84%) were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. When used in combination with cefepime and meropenem, levofloxacin did not increase coverage. However, levofloxacin provided an 8% increase in coverage and gentamicin provided an additional 13% increase in coverage, respectively, when used in combination with piperacillin-tazobactam.
Conclusions
Among septic patients at VCUHS, gentamicin provided increased gram-negative coverage when compared with levofloxacin. Although susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam alone was relatively low, the combination of piperacillin-tazobactam and gentamicin provided nearly equivalent coverage to meropenem and gentamicin."

Thus, surface disinfection of noncritical environmental surfaces and medical devices is one of the infection prevention strategies to prevent pathogen transmission. This article will discuss a bundle approach to facilitate effective surface cleaning and disinfection in health care facilities. A bundle is a set of evidence-based practices, generally 3-5, that when performed collectively and reliably have been proven to improve patient outcomes. This bundle has 5 components and the science associated with each component will be addressed. These components are: creating evidence-based policies and procedures; selection of appropriate cleaning and disinfecting products; educating staff to include environmental services, patient equipment, and nursing; monitoring compliance (eg, thoroughness of cleaning, product use) with feedback (ie, just in time coaching); and implementing a “no touch” room decontamination technology and to ensure compliance for patients on contact and enteric precautions. This article will also discuss new technologies (eg, continuous room decontamination technology) that may enhance our infection prevention strategies in the future."

However, cleaning and disinfection are limited by the presence of the patient in room (eg, current ultraviolet devices and hydrogen peroxide systems cannot be used) and the fact that after disinfection pathogenic bacteria rapidly recolonize surfaces and medical devices/equipment. For this reason, there has been great interest in developing methods of continuous room disinfection and/or “self-disinfecting” surfaces.

Current methods for reprocessing flexible endoscopes do not consistently eliminate organic soil. The off-label use of simethicone as a defoaming agent may contribute to reprocessing failures, and endoscope manufacturers have cautioned against its use.
Methods
We sought evidence of simethicone use by interviewing hospital personnel, conducting audits, inspecting endoscopes, and conducting tests.
Results
Researchers examined 69 fully reprocessed endoscopes in 4 hospitals. Microbial cultures were positive for ≥50% of endoscopes. Researchers observed cloudy, shimmery fluid resembling simethicone inside channels and under a duodenoscope elevator mechanism. Crystallized white fragments were observed protruding from a gastroscope water jet outlet. Oily, sticky residue was found on endoscopes, and a 3-dimensional mass was found inside an endoscopic ultrasound endoscope. Hospital personnel reported the use of simethicone, cooking oil and silicone sprays, and tissue glue during endoscopy.
Discussion
The off-label use of defoaming agents, lubricants, and tissue glue is common and many endoscopists consider these products essential. Our findings suggest these substances are not removed during reprocessing and may impact reprocessing effectiveness.
Conclusions
Infection preventionists should determine whether these products are used in their institutions and evaluate methods for removing them. New policies may be needed to support procedural success and effective endoscope reprocessing."

Despite efforts to prevent health care–associated infections (HAIs), these infections continue to challenge health care systems. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention emphasizes implementation of evidence-based practices. Within the complex health care environment, sustained implementation calls for work systems that harness expertise of interprofessional teams, which, in turn, calls for suitable executive, mid-level, and local leadership. The purpose of this review is to highlight the need to study leadership when using a systems approach to reduce HAIs.
Methods
This is a scoping review of HAI studies that used a systems engineering model called the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety model. We examined if and how leadership was addressed within 1 systems approach.
Results
We found 15 studies using the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety model and, of these, leadership was directly mentioned in 3 studies. In the remaining studies, reference to leadership may be inferred by use of terms such as teamwork, managerial oversight, climate and culture, staffing support, and institutional/administrative support.
Conclusions
Research is needed to bring recognition of the role of leadership within a work systems approach to reducing HAIs. We need further examination of leadership attributes and communication behaviors that allow staff to diffuse and sustain best practices to prevent HAIs."

Preoperative colonization with Staphylococcus aureus (SA) increases risk of surgical site infection. Screening for SA followed by skin and nasal decolonization can help to reduce the risk of postoperative infections. Risk factors for colonization are, however, not completely understood.
Methods
A case-control study using questionnaires and patient demographics specifically designed to observe SA colonization risk factors in a presurgical orthopedic population. A total of 115 subjects with a positive preoperative screen for SA nasal colonization prior to orthopedic surgery completed a questionnaire to assess for SA risk factors: these subjects served as our cases. An additional 476 controls completed similar questionnaires. Data collected included demographic, health, and lifestyle information. Multivariable logistic regression was used to generate odds ratios (OR) for risk of SA colonization.
Results
Several risk factors were identified. Male sex (OR 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], [1.4-3.8]) and diabetes (OR 3.8 [1.8-7.8]) significantly increased the risk of SA colonization. Older age, visiting public places (OR 0.2 [0.1-0.3]), recent antibiotic use (OR 0.2 [0.1-0.6]), and the presence of facial hair (OR 0.3 [0.1-0.6]) significantly lowered the risk of SA colonization.
Conclusions
By identifying patients who may be at greater risk of SA colonization, we can better streamline our presurgical techniques to help reduce risk of surgical site infections and improve patient outcomes."

Factors associated with mortality of patients infected with CRAB were inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment (odds ratio [OR], 5.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.56-9.94), septic shock (OR, 5.65; 95% CI, 2.35-13.57), chronic liver disease (OR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.33-4.16), chronic renal disease (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.37-2.99), hypertension (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.08-2.80), neutropenia (OR, 3.31; 95% CI, 1.25-8.77), immunosuppressant use (OR, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.94-5.11), total parenteral nutrition (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.08-2.56), and intubation (OR, 5.03; 95% CI, 2.33-10.87). Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score at admission and Pitt bacteremia score at the onset of CRAB bacteremia were higher in nonsurvivors.
Conclusions
Our study suggests that severity of baseline condition and receiving inappropriate experience antibiotic therapy are major risk factors for higher mortality in patients with CRAB infections. These findings may help clinicians to take appropriate preventive measures and decrease mortality in such patients."

Considerable discrepancies have been observed in the implementation of strategies to liberate patients from mechanical ventilation. The aim of this study was to describe critical care nurses’ knowledge of and self-reported and documented adherence to lung-protective ventilation, daily sedation interruption, and daily assessment of readiness to extubate and evaluate how these practices differ between patients with and without ventilator-associated pneumonia and between survivors and nonsurvivors.
Methods
The survey was conducted in a tertiary-level hospital in Finland from October 2014 to June 2015. Actual adherence was evaluated based on documentation of performed practices.
Results
A total of 86 critical care nurses responded to the survey, and 85 patients were followed. The levels of knowledge of and self-reported adherence to low tidal ventilation were 84.5% and 90.2%, respectively, and the median tidal volume was at a target level in 74.4% of patients. Regarding daily sedation interruption, the level of knowledge was 85.7%, the level of self-reported adherence was 77.3%, and documented adherence was 33.3%. The levels of knowledge and self-reported adherence regarding spontaneous breathing trials were 61.9% and 71.6%, respectively. Adherence to lung-protective ventilation, daily sedation interruption, and daily assessment of readiness to extubate did not differ between patients with (n = 20) and without (n = 65) ventilator-associated pneumonia and between survivors (n = 55) and nonsurvivors (n = 30).
Conclusions
Lung-protective ventilation, including low-tidal ventilation and avoidance of high inspiratory plateau pressures, was well implemented and adhered to. The levels of knowledge and self-reported adherence versus documented adherence regarding daily sedation interruption and spontaneous breathing trial demonstrated insufficient implementation of local guidelines. There was no effect on the outcome."

Multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB) constitute a threat to health care worldwide. Disinfectants are used to prevent and control the spread of MDR-GNB in a hospital setting but their efficacy might be impaired by bacterial mechanisms that may act on both antimicrobials and disinfectants. Determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations is mainly used to determine bacterial susceptibility against disinfectants, but practical tests on surfaces might be more suitable to predict in-use conditions. Our objective was to compare and evaluate 4 different methods widely used to assess surface disinfectant efficacy.
Methods
The efficacy of benzalkonium chloride (BAC), peracetic acid (PAA), and ethanol (ETH) against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and Klebsiella strains was assessed by minimum inhibitory concentration determinations, quantitative suspension tests, qualitative suspension tests, and carrier tests. Test results were compared to ascertain the most appropriate method.
Results
ETH, PAA, and BAC were highly effective against MDR-GNB, but we observed marked differences in efficacious concentrations (up to 100-fold) as a function of the test method applied. Minimum inhibitory concentration determination was not reliable for evaluating susceptibility or resistance to BAC.
Conclusions
Surface tests should be used to determine bacterial susceptibility against disinfectants. Moreover, suitable guidelines are needed that allow for the standardization and comparison of bactericidal values obtained by different investigators."

The aim of this survey was to assess the attitudes of physicians toward antibiotic prescribing and explore their knowledge about antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in ambulatory care settings.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional survey that was administered to physicians who work primarily in ambulatory care settings in the United States. The survey was self-administered, voluntary, and anonymous, and was delivered through electronic mail and online forums using a 35-item questionnaire.
Results
The survey was completed by 323 physicians. Ninety-nine percent of respondents agreed that AMR is a national problem, but only 63% agreed that AMR is a local problem within their own facilities. Ninety-four percent of the respondents reported that each antibiotic prescription can impact AMR; however, 23% still believed that aggressive prescribing is necessary to avoid clinical failures. Factor perceived to have a low to moderate impact on the physicians’ choice of antibiotic was the presence of prescription guidelines (54%). Top measures reported to be effective in reducing the emergence of AMR were institution specific guidelines (94%), institution specific antibiogram (92%), educating health care providers (87%), and regular audits and feedback on antibiotic prescribing (86%).
Conclusions
AMR awareness campaigns and antibiotic stewardships incorporating interactive education and feedback, along with input of local experts, are critically needed to address the problem of AMR in both inpatient and ambulatory settings."

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a leading cause of community-onset and healthcare–associated infection, with high recurrence rates, and associated high morbidity and mortality. We report national rates, leading causes, and predictors of hospital readmission for CDI.
Methods
Retrospective study of data from the 2013 Nationwide Readmissions Database of patients with a primary diagnosis of CDI and re-hospitalization within 30-days. A multivariate regression model was used to identify predictors of readmission.
Results
Of 38,409 patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of CDI, 21% were readmitted within 30-days, and 27% of those patients were readmitted with a primary diagnosis of CDI. Infections accounted for 47% of all readmissions. Female sex, anemia/coagulation defects, renal failure/electrolyte abnormalities and discharge to home (versus facility) were 12%, 13%, 15%, 36%, respectively, more likely to be readmitted with CDI.
Conclusions
We found that 1-in-5 patients hospitalized with CDI were readmitted to the hospital within 30-days. Infection comprised nearly half of these readmissions, with CDI being the most common etiology. Predictors of readmission with CDI include female sex, history of renal failure/electrolyte imbalances, anemia/coagulation defects, and being discharged home. CDI is associated with a high readmission risk, with evidence of several predictive risks for readmission."

Methods
CF care programs provided their written IP&C policies for CF. Policies were analyzed to determine adoption of selected recommendations new in 2013, as well as recommendations made in both 2003 and 2013. Weighted adoption scores were analyzed for association with program characteristics.
Results
The median number of new recommendations adopted by each program was 7 (mean 6.3, range 0-9). The most commonly adopted new recommendations were universal mask use by patients in both inpatient and outpatient settings (85% and 87%, respectively) and contact precautions for CF patients in inpatient and outpatient settings (90% for both). The least frequently adopted new recommendations were the “6-foot rule” in inpatient settings (n = 66, 53%) and auditing disinfection of surfaces in clinic (n = 64, 49%). Larger program size was associated with a higher weighted adoption score (odds ratio [OR] 1.9, P =.02).
Conclusions
Whereas most programs adopted more than one-half of the selected IP&C recommendations assessed, adoption was variable. Efforts to improve adoption of IP&C recommendations should focus on smaller programs with fewer resources."

Currently, very little data exists that compare the features of pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB). Both have similar symptomology and analogous preliminary laboratory results, as both present with positive acid-fast bacilli stains. The objective of this study was to provide data that would help guide clinicians in their decision making regarding isolation precautions for patients, with a preliminary positive result for mycobacteria, prior to species identification.
Methods
We conducted queries for patients who had positive respiratory cultures for mycobacteria via our electronic medical record system, between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2017. Additionally, we collected demographic and medical history, clinical presentation, and radiographic findings. The 2-sample unpaired Student t test, the Χ2 test, and logistic regression were used to compare each group.
Results
Through logistic regression, 8 variables were significantly associated with patients who grew either TB or NTM. History of incarceration, born outside of the United States, cavitation, and lymphadenopathy were associated with TB; tobacco smoke exposure, pre-existing lung disease, immunosuppression, and bronchiectasis were associated with NTM. Incidence of HIV and hemoptysis was not significantly different between the 2 groups.
Conclusions
Through the use of our study findings, improper use of airborne isolation precautions may be reduced or avoided."

This survey study was conducted at the Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, a large academic center in the Bronx, New York. Internal medicine and subspecialty house staff and program directors completed an anonymous electronic survey between April 23 and June 15, 2018.
Results
A total of 197 of 400 (49%) house staff and 23 of 39 (59%) program leaders participated; 107 (54%) trainees and 6 (26%) program leaders self-reported ILI presenteeism in the past 12 months. More than 90% of trainees and program leaders reported that ILI presenteeism places others at risk. Only 9% of program leaders accurately estimated trainee ILI presenteeism prevalence. Both cited “not wanting to burden colleagues” as the top reason for ILI presenteeism. Twenty-six (24%) trainees practiced ILI presenteeism on critical care units. The majority reported that they would provide patient care with upper respiratory symptoms without fever. Most trainees incorrectly answered influenza knowledge questions.
Conclusions
ILI presenteeism prevalence is high within training programs at our medical center. Program leaders can model best practices, enforce nonpunitive sick-leave policies, and ensure infection prevention competencies are met annually."

Cancer patients are at increased risk of infection. Fecal carriage of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE) may increase this risk. There are few studies on the prevalence of ESBL-PE colonization and surgical site infections (SSIs).
Methods
This prospective cohort study included patients with gastrointestinal and gynecological malignancies who were admitted to the hospital for elective surgery. Rectal swab cultures were obtained on the day of admission and during the postoperative period every 5 days. Prevalence of ESBL-PE fecal colonization and risk factors for the development of SSI were assessed.
Results
We included 171 patients, 30 (17.5%) of whom were colonized with ESBL-PE at admission. This proportion increased to 21% (37 of 171) of the samples during the hospital stay. Incidence of SSI was 14.6% (n = 25). Ten of 37 (27%) patients colonized by ESBL-PE developed SSI versus 15 of 134 (11%) of the non-ESBL-PE (relative risk [RR], 2.163; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.201-3.897; P = .016). Five patients developed a bloodstream infection, and 4 patients were colonized with ESBL-PE (RR = 4.02; 95% CI, 1.2-3.89; P = .008).
Conclusions
The rate of ESBL-PE fecal colonization in surgical patients was 17.5%. Colonization of ESBL-PE duplicated the risk of SSI by the same strain and, by a factor of 4, the risk of bloodstream infections."

Diagnostic testing using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is infrequently initiated for diagnosis of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in nursing homes. The objectives of this study were to determine the feasibility of implementing nurse-initiated PCR testing of respiratory specimens in nursing home settings and to compare antibiotic prescribing prior to and during the implementation.
Methods
This was a pragmatic, historically controlled study in 3 nursing homes (181 total beds) in Melbourne, Australia.
Results
The number of PCR tests of respiratory specimens (over 12 months) increased from 5 to 67 when nurses could initiate the tests. Residents with RTI symptoms had a virus identified by PCR in 50.7% of tests, including 14 positive for influenza. Six outbreaks were identified. When clustering was taken into consideration, incidence rates of antibiotic days of therapy did not change (incidence rate ratio = 0.94, 95% confidence interval, 0.25-3.35, P = .92) despite identification of more viral pathogens.
Conclusions
In nursing homes, nurse-initiated PCR testing of respiratory specimens is feasible and useful in terms of identifying the cause of many RTIs and outbreaks, and viruses are common in this context. However, the current study suggests the availability of these test results alone does not impact antibiotic prescribing."

Results
S aureus pathogens were isolated from ≥1 OR reservoirs in 45.7% (37 of 81) of surgical cases, and epidemiologically related transmission events were confirmed in 22.5% (9 of 40) of case-pairs. Patient skin sites and provider hands provided comparable risk of OR S aureus exposure (19 of 481 patient vs 35 of 1,173 provider hands, relative risk [RR], 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77-2.29; P = .32).

The effectiveness of the surgical safety checklist (SSC) in countries with different socioeconomic backgrounds is uncertain.

Methods
An epidemiological retrospective study was conducted in the university hospitals in Ottawa, Canada, and Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Data were collected through chart review from the period before and after the SSC implementation.
Results
The SSI rate decreased from 27.7%-25.9% (P = .625) and from 17.0%-14.4% in Canada and Brazil, respectively (P = .448) after the SSC implementation. In Canada, there was no SSI in incomplete SSC, and in Brazil, SSI was 20.0% (P = .026).
Discussion
Despite high and regular completion of the SSC in the Canadian and Brazilian hospitals, respectively, there was no significant reduction of SSI after the SSC implementation in any setting. However, in Brazil, the association between incomplete SSC and higher SSI rates demonstrated the potential impact of the SSC in developing countries.
Conclusions
The effect of the SSC on SSI may be greater in developing countries due to minor investment and consolidation of policies in SSI prevention."

Isolation precautions used against multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms are responsible for many emotional side effects. We evaluated patient's feeling after a hospitalization for an MDR infection.
Methods
We conducted a qualitative study that included 11 interviews from August 2017 to June 2018. We used phenomenology and verbatim transcription analysis was performed using NVivo software. Patients reported mainly negative feelings. Among them, 4 main themes were expressed: a desire to "be free from carriage," self-questioning regarding its nosocomial origin, the reduction of the therapeutic arsenal, and the expression of many fears especially relapse.
Results
For most of the participants (n = 6/11), the type of bacteria that colonized their digestive tract was precisely known including the MDR characteristics of the infection. Participants were convinced that the infection was strongly linked to the hospital and considered it as nosocomial that led to anxiety, especially regarding the origin of the infection and the absence of formal source of infection.
Conclusions
MDR infections are negatively impacting patient's lived experience even after hospital discharge, partly owing to prior implementation of isolation precautions. We need to improve communication between specialists and general practitioners to reassure the patient and his surroundings regarding the anxiety resulting from such hospitalization."

Similar results were found in the analysis for HepB vaccination completion, except that subjects born in the United States showed a higher likelihood of HepB vaccination completion.
Conclusions
HepB vaccination initiation and completion were associated with a number of characteristics that can be utilized to develop strategies to increase HepB vaccination coverage among adults traveling to a country of high or intermediate endemicity."

Urinary tract infection (UTI)- related hospitalizations are a poor patient outcome in the rapidly growing home health care (HHC) arena that serves a predominantly elderly population. We examined the association between activities of daily living (ADL) and risk of UTI-related hospitalization among this population.
Methods
Using a retrospective cohort design, we conducted a secondary data analysis of a 5% random sample of a national HHC dataset, the Outcome and Assessment Information Set for the year 2013. Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Service Utilization was used as a guiding framework for statistical modeling. We used logistic regression to examine the association between UTI-related hospitalization and predisposing, enabling, or need factors.
Results
Among beneficiaries (n = 24,887) hospitalized in 2013, 1,133 had UTI-related hospitalizations. HHC patients with a UTI-related hospitalization were more likely to have severe ADL dependency, impaired decision making, and lower Charlson Comorbidity Index, than those with a non UTI-related hospitalization (P < .001). Risk factors for UTI-related hospitalization included female sex, (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25-1.66), Medicaid recipient (AOR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.09-3.64), severe ADL dependency (AOR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.16-1.94), the presence of a caregiver to assist with supervision and safety (AOR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.06-1.49), treatment for UTI in the previous 14 days (AOR, 2.85; 95% CI, 2.46-3.29), presence of a urinary catheter (AOR, 3.77; 95% CI, 2.98-4.77), and prior history of indwelling or suprapubic catheter (AOR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.06-1.94).
Conclusions
ADL dependency levels are a potentially modifiable risk factor for UTI-related hospitalization on admission to HHC. ADL dependency levels can inform clinical interventions to ameliorate ADL dependency in HHC settings and identify groups of patients at high risk for UTI-related hospitalization."

Fluoroquinolones are often prescribed unnecessarily and are an important risk factor for infection with fluoroquinolone-resistant gram-negative bacilli and Clostridioides difficile.
Methods
We conducted a quasi-experimental study to determine the impact of sequential syndrome-specific stewardship interventions on use of and resistance to fluoroquinolones in a tertiary care hospital. An initial 2-year intervention focused on reducing treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria and ensuring concordance of urinary tract infection treatment with guidelines. A second 5-year intervention focused on limiting overuse of fluoroquinolones for health care–associated pneumonia in conjunction with a formal stewardship program. The primary outcomes were fluoroquinolone use and changes in use over time analyzed by segmented regression analysis.
Results
The asymptomatic bacteriuria and urinary tract infection intervention resulted in a significant reduction in fluoroquinolone use, with a significant change from an increasing to a decreasing rate of use (change in slope of quarterly defined daily doses/1,000 patient days –15.3, P < .01). The health care–associated pneumonia intervention resulted in a continued significant reduction in fluoroquinolone use (rate ratio = 0.68, P < .01). During the interventions, fluoroquinolone susceptibility increased significantly in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., or C difficile.
Conclusions
Antimicrobial stewardship interventions focused on specific syndromes may be effective in reducing fluoroquinolone use. In our hospital, reduction in fluoroquinolone use resulted in increased fluoroquinolone susceptibility in P aeruginosa, but not other Enterobacteriaceae or C difficile."

Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common health care–associated infections. Staphylococcus aureus remains the most common etiologic agent causing SSIs. Studies confirm S aureus carriage increases the risk of S aureus SSIs. The purpose of this article is to review the strategies to reduce SSIs due to S aureus focusing on nasal decolonization.
Results
Published studies indicate screening patients for S aureus nasal carriage and decolonizing carriers during the preoperative period decreases the risk of S aureus SSIs in cardiac and orthopedic surgery. Mupirocin remains the best topical agent at eradicating nasal S aureus however, concerns over resistance have led to development of alternative agents. Nasal povidone-iodine, alcohol-based nasal antiseptic, and photodynamic therapy are promising new interventions, but more studies are needed.
Conclusions
Short term nasal mupirocin is still the most studied and effective topical agent in eradicating S aureus nasal colonization. However, increasing mupirocin resistance remains an ongoing concern and newer agents are needed. Currently, preoperative S aureus decolonization often uses combination chlorhexidine gluconate bathing and nasal mupirocin considering that colonization of multiple body sites is commonly seen."

Hospital-acquired infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are a threat to patient safety and hospital economy. Training in hygiene precautions is known to limit MDRO spread and patient morbidity. As infection prevention is a collaborative task, we developed an interprofessional educational intervention, including a reflective unit about MDRO. This article reports on the perceptions of professionals for MDRO management.
Methods
In 2017, we conducted 8 trainings, including facilitated group discussions focusing on the question how participants think others experience MDRO. Results were analyzed using a socio-constructivist qualitative approach.
Results
A total of 51 health care workers from 13 professions and 5 hospitals participated, generating 366 items for coding. Three main themes could be identified: (1) significant barriers in educating clinicians and informing lay persons, (2) emotional reactions–especially anxiety and anger–from the perspective of lay persons and professionals evoked by MDRO, and (3) perceived economic burden.
Conclusions
MDROs generate psychosocial side effects with an impact on health care management and on professional-patient relationships and interprofessional relationships. Specifically, emotions evoked by insufficient information and transparency play a major role. Therefore, hygiene trainings must not be limited to basic skills. In addition, they should be comprised of communication and educational techniques and evoke attentiveness for emotional stress."

Developing timelines of nosocomial Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is critical to improving control and preventive measures. The objective of this study was to provide data-driven estimates of CDI timelines of diagnosis, isolation, and treatment in a hospital setting.
Methods
We obtained data for all CDI inpatients with symptoms onset occurring between January 1, 2013, and December 30, 2017, from St Joseph's Healthcare in Hamilton, Canada. We analyzed full empirical distributions of timelines associated with the diagnosis, isolation, and treatment of CDI.
Results
A total of 683 inpatients with CDI symptoms were recorded, of which 243 cases were identified as health care–associated infection (HAI). The mean time intervals between the onset of CDI symptoms after admission and the release of laboratory results were 1.2 days and 1.9 days for the HAI and community-associated infection (CAI) patient groups, respectively. The mean time intervals from symptoms onset to the start of isolation were 1.5 days and 2.6 days for the corresponding patient groups. The initiation of treatment within 2 days of symptoms onset reduced the duration of first isolation (P value < .0001); however, the type of initial antibiotic used for CDI treatment was not associated with the duration of isolation.
Conclusions
Estimated timelines did not differ (P values > .6) between HAI and CAI patient groups with symptoms onset after admission. These estimates are useful for evaluating the effectiveness of CDI interventions."

Methods
Outpatients at the Veterans Affairs Western New York Healthcare System were identified via an electronic antibiotic alert from June 2017 to September 2017. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression identified stewardship targets.
Results
Of the 1,063 patients, 40% of antibiotic prescriptions were not indicated. Urinary tract infections (21%), bronchitis (20%), skin structure infections (17%), and sinusitis (10%) were common causes of inappropriate antibiotic use. Azithromycin (37%) was prescribed unnecessarily most often, followed by ciprofloxacin (16%), amoxicillin/clavulanate (13%), and cephalexin (12%). The correct drug was chosen in 52%, dose in 81%, and duration in 75% of patients. When the antibiotic was indicated, the correct drug was 2.9 times more likely to be prescribed and 2 times more likely to have the correct duration and receive care in the emergency room.
Discussion
Focusing on 4 drugs; amoxicillin/clavulanate, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and cephalexin accounted for 80% of unnecessary drug use. This study provides a guide to concentrate efforts during implementation of an outpatient stewardship program.
Conclusions
Poor antibiotic prescribing was found in the outpatient setting. This study identifies areas for improvement via stewardship."

abstract = "Background
The aim of this study was to obtain the first national estimates of the current prevalence and incidence and death of health care–associated infections (HAIs) of all types in acute care hospitals in Ukraine.
Methods
Prospective surveillance was conducted from January 2014 to December 2016 in 17 hospitals. Surveillance case definitions were derived from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network HAI case definitions. The identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of cultures were determined using a automated microbiology analyzer. Some antimicrobial susceptibility tests used Kirby-Bauer antibiotic testing.
Results
Of 97,340 patients, 10,986 (11.3%) HAIs were observed. The most frequently reported HAI types were surgical site infections (60%), respiratory tract infections (pneumonia and lower respiratory tract, 18.4%), bloodstream infections (10.2%), and urinary tract infections (9.5%). Death during hospitalization was reported in 9.7% of HAI cases. The most common organism reported was Escherichia coli, accounting for 21.8% of all organisms, followed by Staphylococcus aureus (18.4%), Enterococcus spp (15.7%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.4%). Antimicrobial resistance among the isolates associated with HAIs showed that 42.1% and 3.6% of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp isolates were β-lactam (oxacillin)– and glycopeptide (teicoplanin)-resistant, respectively. Meticillin resistance was reported in 39.2% of S aureus isolates.
Conclusions
HAIs and increasing antimicrobial resistance present a significant burden to the Ukraine hospital system. Infection control priorities in hospitals should include preventing surgical site infections, respiratory tract infections (which also include PNEU and LRTI), bloodstream infections, and urinary tract infections, as well preventing infections due to antimicrobial-resistant pathogens."

abstract = "Background
Tracer antibiotic algorithms using administrative data were investigated to estimate mortality attributable to extensively drug-resistant gram-negative infections (GNIs).
Methods
Among adult inpatients coded for GNIs, colistin cases and 2 comparator cohorts (non-carbapenem β-lactams or carbapenems) treated for ≥4 consecutive days, or died while receiving the antibiotic, were separately propensity score-matched (1:2). Attributable mortality was the in-hospital mortality difference among propensity-matched groups. Infection characteristics and sepsis severity influences on attributable mortality were examined. Algorithm accuracy was assessed by chart review.
Results
Of 232,834 GNIs between 2010 and 2013 at 79 hospitals, 1,023 per 3,350 (30.5%) colistin and 9,188 per 105,641 (8.7%) β-lactam (non-carbapenem) comparator cases died. Propensity-matched colistin and β-lactam case mortality was 29.2% and 16.6%, respectively, for an attributable mortality of 12.6% (95% confidence interval 10.8-14.4%). Attributable mortality varied from 11.0% (7.5%-14.7%) for urinary to 15.5% (12.6%-18.4%) for respiratory (P < .0001), and 4.6% (2.1%-7.4%) for early (≤4 days) to 16.6% (14.3%-18.9%) for late-onset infections (P < .0001). Attributable mortality decreased to 7.5% (5.6%-9.4%) using a carbapenem comparator cohort but increased 9-fold in patients coded for severe sepsis or septic shock (P < .0001). Our colistin algorithm had a positive predictive value of 60.4% and sensitivity of 65.3%.
Conclusions
Mortality attributable to treatment-limiting resistance during GNIs varied considerably by site, onset, and severity of infection."

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is responsible for many hospital-associated infections. Both MRSA-colonized and MRSA-infected patients must be isolated on contact precautions per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. This study evaluates the current practice for removing MRSA-colonized patients from contact precautions and proposes a new protocol to decrease inconsistencies with screening methodologies.
Methods
This was a retrospective chart review of MRSA screening swabs collected at an academic medical center between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2017. Of those patients with MRSA screening swabs, extra-nasal cultures were also evaluated for MRSA infection. Screening swabs were analyzed for appropriateness of order and timing between swabs and active infections. Analysis of variance and the χ² tests were used to determine significance between groups.
Results
This study included 8,310 patients with a combined total of 11,601 nasal swabs. Significantly more (P = .0159) patients with 2 negative nasal swabs returned with a recurrent MRSA infection or colonization than those who had 3 consecutive negative nasal swabs (27.8% vs 17.0%, respectively). Additionally, 47.8% of patients only had 1 appropriately ordered negative nasal swab, indicating that a nurse-driven protocol may be more effective in obtaining the full series of samples required to remove contact precautions.
Conclusions
The current practice for removing a patient from contact precautions for MRSA is insufficient. The number of negative nasal swabs required should be increased from 2 to 3 and a decolonization protocol should be implemented."

The link between bacterial resistance and prognosis remains controversial. Predominant pathogen causing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa), which has increasingly become multidrug resistant (MDR). The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between MDR VAP Pa episodes and 30-day mortality.
Methods
From a longitudinal prospective French multicenter database (2010-2016), Pa VAP onset and physiological data were recorded. MDR was defined as non-susceptibility to at least 1 agent in 3 or more antimicrobial categories. To analyze if MDR episodes were associated with greater in-hospital 30-day mortality, we performed a multivariate survival analysis using the multivariate nonlinear frailty model.
Results
A total of 230 patients presented 286 Pa VAP. A maximum of 3 episodes per patient was observed; 73 episodes were MDR and 213 were susceptible. In the multivariate model, factors independently associated with 30-day mortality included hospitalization in the 6 months preceding the first episode (hazard ratio [HR], 2.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.50-3.60; P = .0002), chronic renal failure (HR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.15-4.77; P = .0196), and Pa VAP recurrence (HR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.79-4.87; P = .032). Finally, MDR Pa VAP was not associated with death (HR, 0.87; 95% CI; 0.52-1.45; P = .59).
Conclusions
This study did not identify a relationship between the resistance profile of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and mortality."

Several observational studies suggest that gloves of health care workers are major routes of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii transmission. However, limited experimental data are available assessing Acinetobacter transmission from gloves to environmental surfaces. This study determined whether A baumannii was easily transferred from nitrile gloves to polypropylene plastic compared with other gram-negative bacteria that cause health care–associated infections in laboratory-controlled experiments.
Methods
Gloved fingerpad-to-fomite transfer efficiency was determined for drug-resistant and -sensitive strains of A baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Results
Only A baumannii transferred from gloves to fomites 3 minutes after the bacterial transfer event. Transfer efficiency of A baumannii was 0.1%-33% at that time point.
Discussion
Bacterial transfer from contaminated gloves to the hospital environment may be related to the type of contaminating bacteria, inoculated bacterial level, fomites, and glove materials. Therefore, it is important to need a comprehensive assessment of the transfer efficiency.
Conclusions
A baumannii can transfer easily from nitrile gloves to fomite compared with other gram-negative bacteria that cause health care–associated infections. These findings support data from previous observational studies that gloves of health care workers can be major routes of A baumannii transmission in clinical settings."

The frequency of primary and revision total knee and hip replacements (pTKRs, rTKRs, pTHRs, and rTHRs, respectively) is increasing in the United States due to demographic changes. This study evaluated the impact of preoperative patient and clinical factors on the risk of surgical site infection (SSI) within the 90-day period after primary and revision total joint replacements (TJR).
Methods
A retrospective observational cohort study was designed using the IBM MarketScan and Medicare databases, 2009-2015. Thirty-four comorbidities were assessed for all patients, and multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate factors associated with higher odds of SSI after adjusting for other patient and clinical preoperative conditions.
Results
The study included a total of 335,134 TKRs and 163,547 THRs. SSI rates were 15.6% and 8.6% after rTKR and rTHR, respectively, compared with 2.1% and 2.1% for pTKR and pTHR, respectively. Comorbidities with the greatest adjusted effect on SSI across all TJRs were acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (odds ratio [OR], 1.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-2.34; P = .0232), paralysis (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.26-1.94; P < .0001), coagulopathy (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.36-1.62; P < .0001), metastatic cancer (1.48; 95% CI, 1.24-1.76; P < .0001), and congestive heart failure (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.30-1.49; P < .0001).
Conclusions
SSI occurred most commonly among patients after revision TJR and were related to many patient comorbidities, including diabetes, congestive heart failure, and coagulopathy, which were significantly associated with a higher risk of SSI after TJR."

Methods
Qualitative data were collected while shadowing 4 nurses on 2 medical/surgical units at a university medical center between September and October 2016. Observers documented nurses' movements in handwritten fieldnotes. Fieldnote data were analyzed using a descriptive approach with visual depiction to map care delivery in precaution and non-precaution rooms.
Results
Nurses moved between non-precaution rooms, completing 1-4 tasks per room entry, over the course of several brief room entries and exits. In contrast, nurses rarely entered contact precaution rooms to complete only a few tasks, generally completing ≥10 tasks per room entry. Although hand hygiene on room entry/exit was consistently performed, a breakdown in practice occurred in precaution rooms as nurses tended to move between tasks and contact with the environment without performing hand hygiene.
Conclusions
Differences in how nurses structure their work in contact precaution rooms may contribute to risk of infectious disease transmission. Understanding and addressing the challenges specific to how nurses work is a critical part of infection prevention in today's hospital environment."

Environmental decontamination is one of the most effective methods to prevent transmission of infectious pathogens in child care centers (CCCs). Alongside state recommendations, national organizations—including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)—offer best-practice policies. In Michigan, these sets of guidelines differ, and the extent to which CCC practices agree with either set of protocols is unknown.
Methods
A survey of environmental decontamination practices was administered at a professional meeting of CCC directors (N = 24) in a single Michigan county. CCC practices (eg, products, locations, frequencies) were compared to state and AAP guidelines. Bivariate analyses investigated CCC characteristics as predictors of decontamination policy agreement.
Results
CCC agreement with established policy was slightly higher for national AAP guidelines (66%) than Michigan standards (59%). The use of an outside child care health consultant was strongly associated with a significantly higher level of agreement with state decontamination policy (P = .01).
Conclusion
We noted substantial disagreement between county CCC practices and state/national guidelines, regardless of CCC size or director experience. Results highlight opportunities to improve CCC director familiarity with current state and nationally advised protocols, to consolidate state licensing and AAP guidelines, and to promote the use of child care health consultants."

abstract = "Background
Patients colonized or infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and or vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus are placed under contact precautions. Contact precautions require patients to be placed in single rooms and their health care workers (HCWs) to wear gowns, aprons and gloves on entry and doffing on exit. Glove use is widely accepted to be associated with poor hand hygiene compliance. We trailed the removal of gloves for contact precautions for contacts not expected to involve body fluids to improve hand hygiene between multiple contacts of the patient and patient zone.
Methods
We have conducted a 5 phase study of the removal of gloves for contacts without body fluids in 250 HCWs using pretrial focus groups (N = 12), hand microbiology (N = 40) (reported elsewhere), development of a modified contact precautions poster, trial of modified poster (n = 100), posttrial focus group discussion (n = 22), and a survey of HCWs postrollout in additional locations (n = 76).
Results
Pretrial focus groups identified 4 themes, and the leading theme identified as the facilitator for glove use as self-protection. HCWs viewed current contact precaution guidelines as preventing them from making their own judgement regarding the need for gloving for patient contacts, leading continuous glove use without changing gloves between multiple contacts. Participants believed that the trial empowered them to make their own clinical judgment for gloves and to consciously use hand hygiene between dry (no body fluid) contacts. Four themes were discussed during the posttrial focus groups and although self-protection remained the central theme, hand hygiene replaced glove use. Participants spoke of an appreciation of and increased trust in hand hygiene during nonglove use for dry contacts. The survey responses from additional sites were mostly positive for the safety of nonglove use for dry contacts, it improved hand hygiene and that the adoption of the modified guidelines was empowering.
Conclusions
The trial of nonglove use for expected dry contact, while caring for patients under contact precautions for methicillin-resistant S aureus and or vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, was successful in refocusing HCWs reliance on hand hygiene for self-protection. Mandatory glove use for contact precautions was believed to contribute to their failure to change gloves between procedures on the same patient and patient zone, with HCWs now recognizing multiple contacts with the same gloves as a risk for contamination."

We recruited NH personnel knowledgeable about the facility's decision-making processes and infection prevention program. Interviews were conducted over-the-phone and audio-recorded; transcripts were analyzed using conventional content analysis.
Results
We enrolled 14 NHs across the United States and interviewed 42 personnel. Six themes emerged: Benefits of NHSN, External Support and Motivation, Need for a Champion, Barriers, Risk Adjustment, and Data Integrity. We did not find substantive differences in perceptions of NHSN value related to participants' professional roles or enrollment category. Some participants from newly enrolled NHs felt well supported through the NHSN enrollment process, while participants from earlier enrolled NHs perceived the process to be burdensome. Among participants from non-enrolled NHs, as well as some from enrolled NHs, there was a lack of knowledge of NHSN.
Conclusions
This qualitative study helps fill a gap in our understanding of barriers and facilitators to NHSN enrollment and reporting in NHs. Improved understanding of factors influencing decision-making processes to enroll in and maintain reporting to NHSN is an important first step towards strengthening infection surveillance in NHs."

abstract = "Background
Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are dedicated to improving antimicrobial use. Although clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are available for the development of ASPs, it is unclear what the quality of these guidelines are. We therefore systematically reviewed published CPGs for the development of acute care hospital-based ASPs.
Methods
Primary literature, CPG and health technology assessment databases, and infectious diseases society websites were searched. Abstract and full-text review of the search results for inclusion were performed independently by 2 assessors. Overall quality of included CPGs was assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II instrument.
Results
We identified 1,064 unique publications; 18 warranted full-text review. Five publications were included in the final review. The National Institute for Care and Excellence from the United Kingdom, the Dutch Working Party on Antibiotic Policy, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America/Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America from the United States all had high quality guidelines on the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II scale.
Discussion
We identified 5 CPGs for creating a hospital-based ASP. Prior authorization and/or restriction policies that appeared in all 5 guidelines should be considered essential for the development of an effective hospital-based ASP.
Conclusions
High quality CPGs are available for implementation of ASPs in acute care hospitals."

Multiple outbreaks from contaminated duodenoscopes have been reported since 2008. This study assessed results of a multicenter comprehensive quality control (QC) program to enhance manual cleaning efficacy of duodenoscopes in endoscopy units.
Methods
Digestive Endoscopy Society of Taiwan implemented a QC program with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) testing of patient-used duodenoscopes in 2 rounds of on-site audit in endoscopy units. ATP samples were obtained from 5 different locations of the duodenoscope after manual cleaning. Duodenoscope exceeding ATP benchmark of 200 relative light units indicated inadequate manual cleaning.
Results
During the first round on-site audit, 12 hospitals and 27 patient-used duodenoscopes were analyzed. Distal end outer surface (29.6%), elevator mechanism (51.9%), distal attachment cap (59.3%), elevator wire channel (37.0%), and suction biopsy channel (37.0%) were inadequately cleaned. Overall, 19 (70.4%) duodenoscopes had inadequate manual cleaning, ranging widely from 0%-100% among endoscopy units. During the follow-up on-site audit, 32 patient-used duodenoscopes were analyzed, and 6 (18.8%) had inadequate manual cleaning.
Conclusions
ATP tests may provide real-time feedback on the cleaning efficacy of patient-used duodenoscopes. Implementing a comprehensive QC program could enhance the efficacy of manual cleaning in endoscopy units."

Infections among hemodialysis patients continues to be major causes of morbidity and mortality despite advances in the science of infection prevention. Many infections are potentially preventable, yet research suggests that evidence-based interventions are not uniformly practiced in dialysis settings. The purpose of the project was to reduce the risk of infection among hemodialysis patients in an outpatient dialysis clinic in upstate New York through the development of an enhanced patient safety culture.
Methods
A survey was used to assess the safety culture of a large outpatient dialysis program. A Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program was instituted to enhance infection prevention practices. Evidence-based checklists and audit tools were used to track staff adherence to protocols.
Results
Scores on the survey were strongly correlated with bloodstream infection rates. Adherence to infection control standards improved when the End Stage Renal Disease Safety Program was implemented, with audits improving from 27%-82% of procedures performed correctly. Bloodstream infection rates decreased from 2.33-1.07 events per 100 patient months, and the standardized infection ratios decreased from 1.960-0.985 in the 12-months after implementation.
Conclusions
The Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program model and implementation of the safety program may be effective in improving the culture of safety and adherence to evidence-based practices in hemodialysis. Enhanced patient safety culture is correlated with improved patient outcomes."

This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology of multidrug-resistant microorganism (MDRO) carriage at hospital admission and to identify risk factors for MDRO influx into hospital settings.
Methods
This cohort study was conducted at a 1,051-bed university-affiliated hospital in the Republic of Korea between July 1 and December 31, 2017. Active surveillance for MDRO carriage was performed within 48 hours of hospitalization in all adult patients who had prior hospitalization within the preceding 3 months.
Results
During the study, 575 patients were admitted with a hospitalization history within 3 months. Active surveillance at hospital admission was performed in 192 eligible patients. Thirty-three (17.2%) patients with MDRO carriage were identified from active surveillance. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, prior exposure to antibiotics within 90 days, hospitalization for ≥60 days before admission, cognitive dysfunction, percutaneous drainage, and underlying pulmonary diseases were identified as independent risk factors for MDRO influx.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest a significant prevalence of MDRO acquisition at acute care hospital admission in patients who had been recently hospitalized. To control the spread of MDRO, collaborations among health care institutions and targeted screening at hospital admission according to patient risk factors are warranted."

Gastrointestinal endoscopes become highly contaminated during use (ie, internal channels contain 7-10-log10 enteric microorganisms). Currently, endoscopes (eg, bronchoscopes and gastrointestinal endoscopes) are classified as semicritical items because they contact intact mucous membranes and most commonly undergo cleaning followed by high-level disinfection, which may result in as little as a 6-log10 reduction of microorganisms. Therefore, and not surprisingly, in recent years there have been multiple reports that have documented that endoscopes, especially duodenoscopes, frequently remain contaminated with bacterial pathogens after proper cleaning and disinfection. Multiple outbreaks of multidrug-resistant organisms from contaminated duodenoscopes have resulted in substantial death and morbidity. Because duodenoscopes commonly contact nonintact mucous membranes and sterile tissue, such endoscopes should be considered critical items. We propose that to ensure patient safety, we follow the Spaulding scheme and move from high-level disinfection to sterilization of reusable endoscopes or use an alternative diagnostic/therapeutic method (eg, disposable sterile endoscopes)."

The objective of this review was to compare the effectiveness of connector decontamination with 70% alcohol wipes, alcoholic chlorhexidine gluconate wipes, or alcohol impregnated caps to prevent catheter-associated bloodstream infection (CABSI).
Methods
A systematic search was conducted in CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, and PubMed. The primary outcome was CABSI, with randomized and observational studies included. The inclusion criteria were: English language, any age group, no date limitations, and reporting connector decontamination interventions to prevent CABSI. The exclusion criteria were: multimodal interventions, letters, and conference abstracts. Quality assessment with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, a narrative synthesis, and meta-analysis were conducted. Pooled data used a random effects model for pair-wise comparisons, due to clinical heterogeneity. Statistical heterogeneity was investigated by visual model inspection, χ², and I² statistics.
Results
Ten studies compared 70% alcohol wipes with 70% alcohol-impregnated caps, and 2 studies (n = 1,216) tested an alcoholic chlorhexidine gluconate wipe. Alcoholic chlorhexidine gluconate wipes were associated with significantly less CABSI than 70% alcohol wipes (risk ratio, 0.28; 95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.39). Alcohol-impregnated caps were associated with significantly less CABSI than 70% alcohol wipes (risk ratio, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.28-0.65). Studies were of low to moderate quality.
Conclusions
Alcohol impregnated caps and alcoholic chlorhexidine gluconate wipes were associated with significantly less CABSI than 70% alcohol wipes. This requires confirmation in randomized controlled trials."

The widespread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) antimicrobial decolonization in the clinical setting may lead to an increase in the prevalence of multiresistance to coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) owing to their selection. This study aimed to investigate the impact of MRSA decolonization strategies, using mupirocin and chlorhexidine, on their CoNS susceptibility.
Methods
A total of 312 CoNS isolates were collected before starting the decolonization protocols “baseline strains” (BLS) group, 330 isolates were collected after application of the targeted decolonization protocol “targeted decolonization strains” group, and 355 isolates were collected after application of the universal decolonization protocol “universal decolonization strains” group. Methicillin-resistant CoNS (MR-CoNS) were identified and tested for mupirocin and chlorhexidine susceptibilities. Heptaplex polymerase chain reaction assay was applied for simultaneous screening for chlorhexidine (CHX-R) and mupirocin resistance (Mu-R) genes.
Results
Mu-R prevalence of MR-CoNS among the BLS group was considered moderate (9.1%); however, CHX-R in the BLS group was 5.8%, the rate of which significantly increased among the universal decolonization strains group.
Discussion
Both MRSA decolonization strategies have an additional benefit in reducing the prevalence of MR-CoNS. The prevalence Mu-R rate didn't change significantly during either of the MRSA decolonization practices that may be due to the local nature of mupirocin application on the nasal mucosa only. In contrast CHX-R that was found to be significantly higher among the UDS group.
Conclusions
Our findings indicate that both MRSA decolonization strategies have an additional benefit in reducing the prevalence of MR-CoNS. Although the universal MRSA decolonization has superior efficacy in decolonization of CoNS, it may increase the risk of selecting CHX-R and Mu-R. In addition, other potential resistance genes should be studied."

Blood culture contamination with gram-positive organisms is a common occurrence in patients suspected of bloodstream infections, especially in emergency departments. Although numerous research studies have investigated the cost implications of blood culture contamination, a contemporary systematic review of the literature has not been performed. The aim of this project was to perform a systematic review of the published literature on the economic costs of blood culture contamination.
Methods
PubMed was searched (January 1, 1978, to July 15, 2018) using the search terms “blood culture contamination” or “false-positive blood cultures.” Articles were title searched and abstracts were reviewed for eligible articles that reported immediate or downstream economic costs of blood culture contamination.
Results and Discussion
The PubMed search identified 151 relevant articles by title search, with 49 articles included after abstract review. From the studies included, overall blood culture contamination rates ranged from 0.9%-41%. Up to 59% of patients received unnecessary treatment with parenteral vancomycin as a result of blood culture contamination, resulting in increased pharmacy charges between $210 and $12,611 per patient. Increases in total laboratory charges between $2,397 and $11,152 per patient were reported. Attributable hospital length of stay increases due to blood culture contamination ranged from 1-22 days.
Conclusions
This systematic review of the literature identified several areas of health care expenditure associated with blood culture contamination. Interventions to reduce the risk of blood culture contamination would avoid downstream economic costs."

Registered nurses are uniquely qualified to augment antimicrobial stewardship (AS) processes. However, the role of nursing in AS needs further development. More information is needed regarding gaps in registered nurse knowledge, attitudes toward AS, and how infection preventionists can help.
Methods
An online descriptive survey was deployed to a convenience sample of approximately 2,000 nurses at the bedside. The survey included 15 questions addressing: (1) overall knowledge of AS; (2) antimicrobial delivery; (3) knowledge and attitudes regarding antimicrobial use; (4) antimicrobial resistance; and (5) antimicrobial resources and education.
Results
Three hundred sixteen staff nurses from 3 hospitals (15.8%) responded to the survey. Fifty-two percent of nurses were not familiar with the term “antimicrobial stewardship,” although 39.6% of nurses indicated that an AS program was moderately or extremely important in their health care setting. Almost all nurses (95%) believed that they should be involved in AS interventions.
Discussion
These findings suggest gaps in nursing knowledge rearding AS. However, nurses believed AS programs were important and were eager to be involved.
Conclusions
This study showed that many nurses are not aware of AS, or do not understand their role in contributing to AS endeavors. Infection preventionist education should focus on increasing staff nurse awareness and demonstrating how nurses can make specific AS interventions."

This quantitative, comparative-descriptive study of inpatient units in a large military medical center was designed to compare the effectiveness of compact ultraviolet (UV-C) decontamination to standard chemical decontamination in reducing the microbial burden on Vocera (San Jose, CA) communication devices and to characterize changes in staff cleaning practices following UV-C device implementation.
Methods
Aerobic and anaerobic swabs were used to collect microbial samples from Vocera devices (n = 60) before and after chemical decontamination (first sampling) and before and after UV decontamination (second sampling). Cleaning behaviors were assessed by observation and oral inquiry during the baseline sampling and surveyed 8 weeks after UV-C device implementation. Outcomes included aerobic and anaerobic colony-forming units and prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, or Clostridium difficile, as determined by standard microbiological methods.
Results
No differences were found between the two cleaning methods in their ability to reduce aerobic bacteria; however, UV-C was significantly more effective at reducing bacteria grown anaerobically (P < .01). This study elucidated an 8.3% prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus on Vocera devices in the inpatient environment. Initially, 42% of respondents reported deviations from manufacturer's cleaning guidelines, and 16.7% reported daily or more frequent cleaning of the Vocera devices.
Conclusions
After implementation, UV-C decontamination reduced average cleaning time by 43% and increased the rate of daily Vocera cleaning to 86.5%. Respondents reported an overall 98% user satisfaction with the UV-C device."

Using the search term “influenza,” the URL's of the first 100 English language Web sites were vetted for content to ascertain that the article met inclusion criteria. Five recommended readability tests were conducted using an online service to calculate readability. Overall, the analysis indicates that flu material found on the web is not being written at a level that is widely readable.
Results
None of the 100 sites included in the analysis received an acceptable score on all 5 assessments. One-sample independent t tests (α = 0.05, df = 99) indicated that it is highly unlikely that flu Web sites are being written at the desirable level. Of the 100 sampled sites, 33 had a .com, 29 had a .org, and 22 had a .gov extension. Extension type did not play a role in readability level of these sites.

Symptoms were observed only in HCWs from the Mecca cohort, with 29.3% experiencing respiratory symptoms during the Hajj period or in the subsequent days and 3.3% having gastrointestinal symptoms. Acquisition rates of at least 1 respiratory virus were 14.7% in the Mecca cohort and 3.4% in the Al-Ahsa cohort (P = .003). Acquisition rates of at least 1 respiratory bacterium were 11.8% and 18.6% in the Mecca and Al-Ahsa cohorts, respectively (P = .09). Gastrointestinal pathogens were rarely isolated in both cohorts of HCWs and acquisition of pathogens after the Hajj was documented in only a few individuals.
Conclusions
HCWs providing care for pilgrims both acquire pathogens and present symptoms (especially respiratory symptoms) more frequently than those not working during Hajj."

abstract = "Background
Horizontal transmission of bacteria, especially multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), remains an important concern in hospitals worldwide. Some studies have implicated provider attire in the transmission of organisms within hospitals, whereas others have suggested that evidence supporting this notion is limited.
Methods
PubMed was searched for publications between 1990 and 2018 to identify studies of bacterial contamination of, or dissemination of, bacteria from physician, nursing, or trainee attire, with a specific focus on white coats and surgical scrubs. A total of 214 articles were identified. Of these, 169 were excluded after abstract review and 33 were excluded after in-depth full manuscript review.
Results
Twenty-two articles were included: 16 (73%) cross-sectional studies, 4 (18%) randomized controlled trials, and 2 (9%) cohort studies. Results are organized by microbial contaminants, antibiotic resistance, types of providers, fabric type, antimicrobial coating, and laundering practices. Provider attire was commonly colonized by MDROs, with white coats laundered less frequently than scrubs. Studies revealed considerable differences among fabrics used and laundering practices.
Conclusions
Findings suggest that provider attire is a potential source of pathogenic bacterial transmission in health care settings. However, data confirming a direct link between provider attire and health care–associated infections remain limited. Suggestions outlined in this article may serve as a guideline to reduce the spread of bacterial pathogens, including MDROs, that have the potential to precipitate hospital-acquired infections."

This study examined the prevalence of self-reported symptoms of sensitivity to chlorhexidine solutions among health care workers.
Methods
This study was a cross-sectional online anonymous survey of all workers at a single health service.
Results
Of the 1,050 completed responses, 76.3% were female, 35.3% were nurses and midwives, 28% were medical staff, and 8.7% were working in nonclinical areas. Over 95% used chlorhexidine-based hand hygiene products in their workplace. Nurses and midwives most frequently reported asthma (13.7%), contact dermatitis (27.8%), and previous testing for allergy to chlorhexidine (4.9%). There was a correlation between both the presence of atopy, eczema, or dermatitis and the self-reporting of dry skin, eczema, or dermatitis attributed to chlorhexidine use.
Discussion
Occupational chlorhexidine allergy is an important risk to health care workers. Self-reported symptoms of sensitivity to chlorhexidine solutions revealed high reported use and presence of skin symptoms among health care workers.
Conclusions
Screening programs need to identify nurses who develop chlorhexidine sensitivity due to occupational exposure. Strategies to mitigate risk should provide alternatives for those with sensitization."

Results
Of 752 patients eligible for the study, the total number of HAI was 82, representing an overall prevalence of HAI of 10.9%. Respiratory tract infections were the most prevalent HAI (36.6%). In multivariate analysis, intrinsic risk factors independently associated with HAI were immune-suppression (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.8; P < .001), diabetes (AOR = 2.2; P = .008), and malnutrition (AOR = 2.2; P = .019).

Antimicrobial use (AU) of antipseudomonal β-lactams (APBL) has significantly increased over the past decade in US hospitals. This retrospective cohort study compares 2 common antimicrobial stewardship strategies, syndrome-specific interventions and antimicrobial postprescription prospective audit and feedback (PAF), in reducing AU of APBL at a large community-teaching hospital.
Methods
Four antimicrobial stewardship interventions targeting APBL were serially introduced, including 2 syndrome-specific interventions (bloodstream and intra-abdominal infections) and 2 PAF interventions (carbapenems and piperacillin/tazobactam). Multivariable linear regression was used to examine overall AU of APBL and audited antimicrobial agents.
Results
Overall AU of APBL declined from 92.4-69.1 days of therapy (DOT) per 1,000 patient-days between February 2013 and July 2017 (P < .001). Both syndrome-specific interventions were associated with significant reduction in AU of APBL (–7.7 [95% confidence interval (CI): –11.5, –4.0] and –6.0 [95% CI: –9.7, –2.3] DOT per 1,000 patient-days) for bloodstream and intra-abdominal infections, respectively). No significant change in overall AU of APBL was observed after implementation of PAF interventions for carbapenems (–1.4 [95% CI: –7.4, 4.6] DOT per 1,000 patient-days) or piperacillin/tazobactam (0.9 [95% CI: –3.7, 5.4] DOT per 1,000 patient-days).
Conclusions
Implementation of syndrome-specific interventions was followed by significant reduction in AU of APBL in this population. Despite reducing AU of targeted agents, neither PAF intervention contributed to overall observed decline in APBL use, likely due to compensatory increase in using other APBL."

Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend empiric antipseudomonal combination therapy when Pseudomonas is suspected. However, combination antipseudomonal therapy is controversial. This study compares all-cause 30-day mortality in older patients who received antipseudomonal monotherapy (PMT) or antipseudomonal combination therapy (PCT) for the treatment of community-onset pneumonia.
Methods
This population-based, retrospective cohort study used data from over 150 Veterans Health Administration hospitals. Patients were classified as being at low, medium, or high risk of drug-resistant pathogens. In total, 31,027 patients were assigned to PCT or PMT treatment arms based on antibiotics received in the first 48 hours of hospital admission.
Results
The unadjusted 30-day mortality difference between PCT and PMT was most pronounced in the low-risk group (18% vs 8%), followed by the medium-risk group (24% vs 18%) and then the high-risk group (39% vs 33%). PCT was associated with higher 30-day mortality than PMT overall (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.43-1.66) in all 3 risk groups: low (aOR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.50-1.89), medium (aOR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.14-1.48), and high (aOR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.04-1.40).
Conclusions
Older adults who received combination antipseudomonal therapy for community-onset pneumonia fared worse than those who received monotherapy. Empiric combination antipseudomonal therapy should not be routinely offered to all patients suspected of having pseudomonal pneumonia."

Children with vertically transmitted hepatitis B virus develop chronic infection up to 90% of the time. This study aimed to verify the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in pregnant patients treated in a Brazilian public hospital and analyze the prophylactic measures in newborns.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted by collcting data in the electronic charts of patients who attended the obstetric and maternity departments, from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2016, and evaluating the results of pregnant women's HBsAg, prophylaxis in newborns, and clinical follow-up. The data were tabulated and analyzed using Microsoft Excel software.
Results
Among the 7,763 participating patients, 109 were reactive to HBsAg, and 3 were indeterminate. However, only 28 had correct information on HBV prophylaxis with the parturient and newborn in the chart, and only 16 completed the follow-up.
Conclusions
Most of the HBsAg-positive pregnant women (75%) did not have prophylactic information in the charts, and almost 50% of the pregnant women and newborns who had appropriate prophylaxis did not return for medical follow-up. Failure of prophylaxis can promote vertical/perinatal transmission of hepatitis B virus in newborns of mothers who are HBsAg positive."

Methods
Surveys were distributed to nurses in a New York hospital network and to IPs who attended the 2018 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology annual conference or to IPs who were members of local Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology chapters. Respondents were asked to rate their daily workload increase and to rank their most time-consuming activities in response to exposure and outbreak scenarios.
Results
A total of 150 nurses and 228 IPs responded. Among the nurses, >60-minute workload increases were reported for Clostridium difficile (76%), lice or scabies (46%), and influenza (45%). Among the IPs, >60-minute increases were reported for mumps or measles (66%), tuberculosis (64%), and C difficile (50%). Among the nurses, isolation precautions, patient and family education, and staffing changes were the most frequently reported time-consuming activities. Among the IPs, chart review, exposure list compiling, and preventive measures for exposures were the most frequently reported time-consuming activities.
Conclusions
Organisms that are easier to treat and more difficult to spread, such as scabies or lice, can contribute substantially to nursing workload. Notably, three-quarters of the nurses and one-half of the IPs reported that C difficile adds >1 hour to their daily workload."

Little is known about health care workers’ (HCW) perceptions of, or experiences using, respiratory protective equipment (RPE). We sought to characterize their perceptions and identify reasons underlying inappropriate use.
Methods
We conducted 12 focus groups with nurses and nursing assistants at 4 medical centers. We analyzed the thematic content of 73 discrete “stories” told by focus group participants.
Results
We identified 5 story types surrounding RPE use: 1) policies are known and seen during work routines; 2) during protocol lapses, use is reinforced through social norms; 3) clinical experiences sometimes supersede protocol adherence; 4) when risk perception is high, we found concern regarding accessing RPE; and 5) HCWs in emergency departments were viewed as not following protocol because risk was ever-present.
Discussion
HCWs were aware of the importance of RPE and protocols for using it, and these supported use when protocol lapses occurred. However, protocol adherence was undermined by clinical experience, perceived risk, and the distinct context of the emergency department where patients continually arrive with incomplete or delayed diagnoses.
Conclusions
Protocols, visual cues, and social norms contribute to a culture of safety. This culture can be undermined when HCWs experience diagnostic uncertainty or they mistrust the protocol and instead rely on their clinical experiences."

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is defined as pneumonia that occurs after 48 hours of endotracheal intubation and initiation of mechanical ventilation. The aim of this work was to use a micro-costing method to calculate the costs generated in 2017 for the care of patients with VAP at the Hospital Juárez de México.
Methods
We performed a cross-sectional, retrospective, analytical, and observational study of the databases of the registry of health care–associated infections (HAIs) in 2017, in addition to a micro-costing study.
Results
We studied 48 VAP cases in an adult intensive care unit (AICU). In this period, 1668 ventilator days were identified, with an incidence rate of 28.8 per 1000 days. All cases were caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria and the costs of their care exceeded the average costs for the use of antimicrobials. By calculating the profit on return as an association measure, we found that VAP caused by MDR bacteria confers 9 times the risk of increasing the costs of care above the expected average.
Conclusions
The cost for a case of VAP in the AICU is high and has an impact on the institutional budget. Control measures to prevent the spread of bacteria, particularly MDR bacteria, must be put into place in order to avoid increases in hospital stay costs and mortality."

Preoperative bathing or showering is widely recommended to reduce the risk of surgical site infections. Evidence of the impact of this measure on surgical site infection rates is mixed, and further prospective trials comparing standardized protocols for showering with plain soap or chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG)-containing soap, or bathing with 2% CHG-impregnated cloths are needed to establish the most effective approach. Current evidence favors the use of alcohol-containing solutions, often containing CHG or povidone-iodine, for surgical site preparation of the skin. Preparation of vaginal mucosa prior to gynecologic surgery may be performed using either povidone-iodine or CHG. Surgical hand antisepsis can be performed by scrubbing with an antimicrobial soap or by handrubbing using an alcohol-based handrub. Addition of CHG to alcohol-based handrubs intended for surgical hand antisepsis is not necessary if they meet recommended efficacy criteria. Daily CHG bathing of intensive care unit patients has been shown to reduce a variety of health care–associated infections, most commonly bloodstream infections (BSIs). Achieving and maintaining optimum application protocols may be challenging, suggesting the need for ongoing staff education, monitoring, and feedback. Additional studies are needed to determine the impact of daily CHG bathing of non-intensive care unit patients. Alcoholic CHG is currently the preferred antiseptic for skin preparation prior to insertion of central and arterial intravascular catheters. CHG-impregnated dressings have been shown to reduce catheter-associated BSI. Because of the widespread use of antiseptics, especially CHG, surveillance for emergence of increased tolerance or resistance is warranted. Antiseptics are applied to the skin for a variety of purposes in health care. Common scenarios in which topical antiseptics are used include preoperative bathing, surgical site preparation, surgical hand hygiene, daily bathing of intensive care unit patients, and prevention of intravascular catheter-associated BSI. The purpose of this article is to review recent evidence regarding the best products for skin antisepsis."

Automated drying may help prevent endoscopically transmitted infections. We aimed to assess the efficacy of an automated drying and storage cabinet compared to a standard storage cabinet in achieving endoscope dryness postreprocessing and in reducing the risk of microbial growth.
Methods
Drying times of bronchoscopes, colonoscopes, and duodenoscopes using 2 drying platforms (an automated drying and storage cabinet vs a standard storage cabinet) were measured using cobalt chloride paper. Drying assessments occurred at: 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, and 24 hours. A simple linear regression analysis compared rates of microbial growth after inoculation with Pseudomonas aeruginosa following high-level disinfection at: 0, 3 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours.
Results
Using the automated drying and storage cabinet, internal channels were dry at 1 hour and external surfaces at 3 hours in all endoscopes. With the standard storage cabinet, there was residual internal fluid at 24 hours, whereas external surfaces were dry at 24 hours. For bronchoscopes, colonoscopes, and duodenoscopes, the standard cabinet allowed for an average rate of colony forming unit growth of 8.1 × 106 per hour, 8.3 × 106 per hour, and 7.0 × 107 per hour, respectively; the automated cabinet resulted in colony forming unit growth at an average rate of –28.4 per hour (P = .02), –38.5 per hour (P = .01), and –200.2 per hour (P = .02), respectively.
Conclusions
An automated cabinet is advantageous for rapid drying of endoscope surfaces and in reducing the risk of microbial growth postreprocessing."

Although many evidence-based guidelines for infection prevention are available, not all are systematically implemented into clinical practice. This evidence-to-practice gap has been linked to poor health outcomes. D&I science bridges the gap between research and everyday practice by providing a knowledge base about how health information, interventions, and new clinical practices and policies are translated for use in specific settings. D&I science can expedite and sustain the successful integration of evidence into practice to improve care delivery, population health, and health outcomes.

Use of hand sanitizers has become a cornerstone in clinical practice for the prevention of disease transmission between practitioners and patients. Traditionally, these preparations have relied on ethanol (60%-70%) for bactericidal action.
Methods
This study was conducted to measure the persistence of antibacterial activity of 2 preparations. One was a non-alcohol-based formulation using benzalkonium chloride (BK) (0.12%) and the other was an ethanol-based formulation (63%) (comparator product). The persistence of antibacterial activity was measured against Staphylococcus aureus using a technique modification prescribed in American Society for Testing and Materials protocol E2752-10 at up to 4 hours after application.
Results
The test product (BK) produced a marked reduction in colony-forming units at each of the 3 time points tested (3.75-4.16-log10 reductions), whereas the comparator produced less than 1-log10 reduction over the same time. The differences were highly significant.
Discussion
In the course of patient care or examination, there are instances where opportunities exist for the practitioner's hands to become contaminated (eg, key boards and tables). Persistent antibacterial activity would reduce the chances of transfer to the patient.
Conclusions
These results show a major improvement in persistent antibacterial activity for the BK formulation compared to the comparator ethanol-based formulation."

No single strategy is more effective than proper hand hygiene (HH) in reducing the spread of nosocomial infections. Unfortunately, health care worker compliance with HH is imperfect. We sought to improve HH compliance using an electronic hand hygiene monitoring system (EHHMS) in 2 units to collect unbiased data and provide feedback.
Methods
In this prospective, quasi-experimental study, the Hyginex EHHMS was installed in 2 units at Tufts Medical Center. Ninety-one bracelets were assigned, and electronic data were collected over 8 months. Human observations continued. We compared HH compliance as measured by human observation before, during, and after EHHMS implementation. Pre- and post-implementation surveys were distributed to staff.
Results
The number of electronically captured HH compliance observations was small due to infrequent bracelet use after month 2 of the intervention. HH compliance, as determined by human observation, increased by an average of 1.3 percentage points per month (P = .0005). Survey responses revealed negative attitudes about the EHHMS before and after its implementation.
Conclusions
Despite poor EHHMS participation and negative attitudes toward its implementation, HH compliance, as measured by human observation, significantly improved. Hospitals considering implementing an EHHMS should look to refine the intervention to encourage health care worker participation."

Legionnaires disease occurs worldwide. Many authorities have guidelines and regulations to prevent and control Legionella in water systems. These regulations are based on often very limited field and laboratory observations and measurements. They are, therefore, very different from country to country. This article aims to map the existing regulatory framework of worldwide Legionella control to assess the feasibility of regulatory unification.
Methods
This article gives an overview of the different standards, guidelines, and recommendations as well as how various authorities and/or countries deal with Legionella infection. A 3-step process is followed to identify current regulations.
Results
Although Legionella is a global concern with a common scientific base, the regulatory framework is different from country to country. The current guidelines and standards are not the best possible. Despite different regulatory frameworks, there is still broad unification of underlying principles. Common principles across regulations are avoiding and monitoring critical spots, avoiding water stagnation, and maintaining sufficiently high temperature (above 60°C, below 25°C). Differences between regulations are target group and dangerous Legionella concentration levels.
Conclusions
The comparative analysis of the framework is a good starting point for reaching future regulatory unification based on common ground."

The frequency, risk factors, and outcomes for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia (AL) admitted for induction therapy are unclear.
Methods
We studied 509 consecutive patients with AL admitted between 2006 and 2017 and conducted a prospective C difficile surveillance and ribotyping analysis in a subset of these.
Results
The incidence of CDI was 2.2/1,000 inpatient days during induction, and CDI was rare after discharge. CDI was highest in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. A hospitalization shortly before admission and administration of a greater number of antibiotics increased the risk for CDI. No single class of antibiotics conveyed an increased risk. All cases were successfully treated, and CDI was not associated with an increase in length of stay, costs, or mortality. In a subgroup analysis, 16% of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and 4% with other leukemia types were colonized on admission. Colonization was associated with a higher risk of CDI. Ribotyping of available isolates showed 27 different strain types with 014/020 and 027 being the most frequent.
Conclusions
The number of antibiotics administered are a major risk factor for CDI in patients with AL. However, CDI appears to have minimal clinical impact in this population."

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is frequently implicated in health care–associated outbreaks in burn intensive care units, incurring substantial morbidity and mortality to these high-risk patients and excess costs to health care systems.
Methods
MRSA health care–associated infections (HAIs) were noted before and after the implementation of basic infection prevention measures and the subsequent implementation of universal decolonization with intranasal mupirocin. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to determine the relatedness of clinical isolates. A case-control study was conducted to characterize the risk factors for MRSA HAIs.
Results
Basic interventions failed to decrease the rate of MRSA HAIs, although compliance with these interventions was high throughout the study. MRSA HAIs decreased from 8.53 HAIs per 1,000 patient days before the implementation of intranasal mupirocin to 3.61 HAIs per 1,000 patient days after the implementation of intranasal mupirocin (P = .033). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis disclosed 10 unique clones with no large clusters. The case-control study revealed a significant association between MRSA HAIs and lengths of stay, body surface area burned, intubation, pressor requirement, leukocytosis, lactic acidosis, development of pneumonia, MRSA colonization, and death.
Conclusions
Basic environmental and behavioral interventions fell short of controlling a low-count, sporadic, and multiclonal MRSA outbreak in the burn intensive care unit of a tertiary medical center. However, the added implementation of universal decolonization with intranasal mupirocin was effective. Burn victims with greater disease severity were at higher risk for MRSA HAIs."

The goal of this study was to test for associations between adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content and microbial concentrations on desk surfaces in school classrooms.
Methods
ATP bioluminescence and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) techniques were employed to measure total bacterial, fungal, and human cell concentrations on 66 high-traffic desks spread across 9 schools: 3 in Connecticut (CT) and 6 in Oklahoma (OK). In CT, 6 samples were taken from each desk, 1 precleaning and 5 postcleaning (after 30 minutes, 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, and 21 days). In OK, samples were taken immediately before and after cleaning each desk.
Results
Based on simple linear regression analyses, ATP values were good predictors of microbial concentrations (r = 0.8, P = .003) in both CT school postcleaning samples and OK pre- and postcleaning samples (r = 0.7, P = .00002). However, biomass reductions measured after cleaning were 1.5-2 times greater when measured by ATP than by qPCR (P = .007).
Conclusions
Overall, ATP bioluminescence measurements correlate with qPCR-based surface measurements on school desks but may overestimate the physical removal of bacteria and fungi due to cleaning."

False positive blood cultures result from contamination, consuming laboratory resources and causing unnecessary antibiotic treatment and prolonged hospital stay. Skin disinfection reduces contamination; however, bacteria colonizing human skin are also found in tissues deep into the skin surface. A diversion device diverts the initial 1-2 mL of blood to remove any potentially contaminated skin plug. This study investigates the effect of the device on culture contamination in hospitalized patients.
Methods
In this prospective controlled pragmatic study, blood cultures were obtained using an initial specimen diversion device, either via integrated needle or attachment to a newly placed intravenous catheter. Cultures taken using standard methods served as the control.
Results
Six hundred seventy-one blood cultures were obtained. Two hundred seven cultures were taken using an initial specimen diversion device, with 2 (1.0%) contaminated cultures. Four hundred sixty-four cultures were taken without the device, with 24 (5.2%) contaminated cultures (P < .008). No significant difference was shown in the rate of true-positive cultures.
Conclusions
The use of a diversion device was associated with reduced culture contamination in hospitalized patients over a 6-month period, without concomitant reduction in true-positive cultures. This intervention may result in a reduction in costs, antibiotic use, and duration of hospital stay."

Clinicians play an essential role in the implementation of infection prevention policy. Despite this, little is known about how infection control policy is implemented at an organizational level or what factors influence this process. In this study, we explore these factors and the policy implementation process in the context of the introduction of a national large-scale, government-directed infection prevention policy in Australia.
Methods
Focus groups with infection control professionals were held in 3 states to investigate the perspectives of infection control professionals involved in the implementation of aseptic technique policy requirements in Australian hospitals. Data were analyzed using an interpretive description approach, with themes mapped to the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research.
Results
Common contextual factors were identified across all levels of the healthcare system that influenced implementation of the infection control policy, including external factors associated with the policy itself and the regulatory nature of government-directed policy.
Conclusions
This study suggests that there may be particular constructs and contextual factors that are specific to policy implementation in the hospital setting. A better understanding of these factors and their influence on policy implementation would present an opportunity for improved implementation planning, resource allocation, and more effective policy development."

It is recommended that that only unformed stool from patients with diarrhea be tested for Clostridium difficile infection. We determined the prevalence of and patient characteristics associated with antecedent laxative receipt among hospitalized adults undergoing C difficile testing.
Methods
In a case-control study of 5,452 C difficile tests from 5 hospitals in Southeast Michigan, patients who received laxatives (docusate, senna, polyethylene glycol 3350, bisacodyl, and magnesium hydroxide) in the 24 or 48 hours before testing were identified. Logistic regression was performed to identify patient characteristics associated with laxative receipt before testing.
Results
In 535 (9.8%) and 707 (13%) tests, patients received laxatives in the 24 and 48 hours before testing, respectively. The odds of antecedent laxative receipt were significantly greater for patients residing on a surgical service than a medical service (24 hours odds ratio [OR], 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1–3.1; 48 hours OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 2.3–3.2), patients residing in an intensive care unit (ICU) than a non-ICU (24 hours OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0–1.6; 48 hours OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1–1.6), and patients whose Elixhauser Comorbidity Score was 4 or higher (24 hours OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1–1.7; 48 hours OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2–1.7).

Methods
We used the methodology employed by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to assess the prevalence of HAIs in Punjab Province, Pakistan. Data were collected from 13 hospitals using a structured data collection tool.
Results
Out of 1,553 hospitalized patients, 130 (8.4%) had symptoms of HAIs. The most common HAI was surgical site infection (40.0%), followed by bloodstream infection (21.5%), and lower respiratory tract infection (14.6%). The prevalence of HAI was higher in private sector hospitals (25.0%) and among neonates (23.8%) and patients admitted to intensive care units (33.3%). Patients without HAIs were admitted mainly to public sector hospitals and adult medical and surgical wards.
Conclusions
The study found a high rate of HAIs among hospitals in Pakistan, especially surgical site infections, bloodstream infections, and lower respiratory tract infections. This needs to be addressed to reduce morbidity, mortality, and costs in the future, and further research is planned."

Our primary objective was to assess hand hygiene (HH) compliance before aseptic procedures among birth attendants in the 10 highest-volume facilities in Zanzibar. We also examined the extent to which recontamination contributes to poor HH. Recording exact recontamination occurrences is not possible using the existing World Health Organization HH audit tool.
Methods
In this time-and-motion study, 3 trained coders used WOMBATv2 software to record the hand actions of all birth attendants present in the study sites. The percentage compliance and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for individual behaviors (hand washing/rubbing, avoiding recontamination and glove use) and for behavioral sequences during labor and delivery were calculated.
Results
We observed 104 birth attendants and 781 HH opportunities before aseptic procedures. Compliance with hand rubbing/washing was 24.6% (95% CI, 21.6-27.8). Only 9.6% (95% CI, 7.6-11.9) of birth attendants also donned gloves and avoided recontamination. Half of the time when rubbing/washing or glove donning was performed, hands were recontaminated prior to the aseptic procedure.
Conclusions
In this study, HH compliance by birth attendants before aseptic procedures was poor. To our knowledge, this is the first study in a low- to middle-income country to show the large contribution to poor HH compliance from hand and glove recontamination before the procedure. Recontamination is an important driver of infection risk from poor HH. It should be understood for the purposes of improvement and therefore included in HH monitoring and interventions."

Infection control partially depends on hygiene and communication skills. Unfortunately, motivation for continuous training is lower than desired. Many health care providers (HCPs) do not recognize the need for training but express this need for others. This is attributable to heuristic errors, such as the overconfidence effect. The aim of this study was to quantify the flawed self-assessment in infection-control.
Methods
In this cross-sectional multicenter study, 255 HCPs of different specialties participated in the 29-item, 5-point Likert scale questionnaire, assessing perceived proficiency in hand hygiene and communication skills for both themselves and others (colleagues, trainees, and supervisors of their own specialty and HCPs of others).
Results
222 of 255 surveys could be analyzed. Respondents rated themselves to be better trained in handhygiene (P < .001) than trainees, colleagues, and supervisors; the same was seen for feedback skills (P < .001). HCPs of other specialties were consistently rated worse in all aspects (P < .001).
Conclusion
Results show an overplacement effect in infection prevention skills. The belief of being well educated creates a subjective conviction that no further education in hand hygiene is needed. Thus, HCPs may face motivation barriers that require specialized programs to overcome these beliefs."

The health care community is increasingly aware of the processing challenges and infection risks associated with duodenoscopes owing to published reports of outbreaks and regulatory recalls. Studies have demonstrated that the current practices are inadequate for consistently producing patient-ready endoscopes. Alternatively, terminal sterilization would offer a greater margin of safety and potentially reduce the risk of patient infection. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a hydrogen peroxide–ozone sterilizer with regulatory clearance for terminal sterilization of duodenoscopes.
Methods and Results
Validation studies were performed under laboratory simulated-use and clinical in-use conditions. The overkill method study demonstrated a reduction of at least 6-log of Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores at half-cycle, providing a sterility assurance level of 10−6. In addition, the sterilizer achieved a 6-log reduction of G stearothermophilus in the presence of inorganic and organic soils in a simulated-use study. The clinical in-use study confirmed that the sterilizer achieved sterilization of patient-soiled duodenoscopes under actual use conditions.
Conclusions
Simulated-use and clinical in-use studies demonstrated the efficacy of a hydrogen peroxide–ozone sterilizer for terminal sterilization of duodenoscopes. This offers health care facilities a viable alternative for duodenoscope processing to enhance patient safety as part of a comprehensive infection control strategy."

Hands of health care personnel (HCP) can transmit multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), resulting in infections. Our aim was to determine MDRO prevalence on HCP hands in adult acute care and nursing facility settings.
Methods
A systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, CINAHL, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL was performed. Studies were included if they reported microbiologic culture results following HCP hands sampling; included prevalent MDROs, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, Clostridium difficile, Acinetobacter baumannii, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and were conducted in acute care or nursing facility settings.
Results
Fifty-nine articles comprising 6,840 hand cultures were included. Pooled prevalence for MRSA, P aeruginosa, A baumannii, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus were 4.26%, 4.59%, 6.18%, and 9.03%, respectively. Substantial heterogeneity in rates of pathogen isolation were observed across studies (I2 = 81%-95%). Only 4 of 59 studies sampled for C difficile, with 2 of 4 finding no growth. Subgroup analysis of MRSA revealed the highest HCP hand contamination rates in North America (8.28%). Sample collection methods used were comparable for MRSA isolation (4%-7%) except for agar direct contact (1.55%).
Conclusions
Prevalence of common MDROs on HCP hands vary by pathogen, care setting, culture acquisition method, study design, and geography. When obtained at an institutional level, these prevalence data can be utilized to enhance knowledge, practice, and research to prevent health care–associated infections."

Hand hygiene (HH) is the primary measure in the prevention of health care–associated infections; however, from published studies, compliance of health care workers (HCWs) to HH guidelines is low. There is currently no review on HH compliance rates in developing countries, specifically sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), or the barriers to compliance. We therefore, through a narrative review, sought to identify the compliance with and the barriers to HH in SSA.
Methods
From 3 databases, we performed a search of peer-reviewed studies from SSA, conducted among HCWs, published in the English language between 2005 and 2017. Only studies that reported HH compliance and/or barriers were included.
Results
A total of 278 articles were identified, and the final sample of 27 articles was analyzed in full length. Overall, the HH compliance rate was estimated to be 21.1%, and doctors had better compliance irrespective of the type of patient contact. The main barriers identified were heavy workload, infrastructural deficit (eg, lack of water, soap, hand sanitizers, and blocked/leaking sinks), and poorly positioned facilities.
Conclusions
HH compliance is poor among SSA HCWs. There is a need for more reports of HH compliance in SSA, and emphasis needs to be placed on surgical wards in which surgical site infections—the most common form of health care—associated infections in SSA—are most likely to occur. Barriers identified in this review are consistent with the findings of studies conducted elsewhere; however, it appears that heavy workload, infrastructural deficit, and poorly positioned facilities are more likely in developing countries."

Community-associated Clostridioides difficile infections (CA-CDIs) share many risk factors with health care–associated cases, although the role of socioeconomic factors is poorly understood. This study estimates the influence of several census tract–level measures of socioeconomic status on CA-CDI incidence rates.
Methods
CA-CDI case data from the New Mexico Emerging Infections Program were analyzed using quasi-Poisson regression modeling. Geocoded cases were assigned census tract–level socioeconomic measures to explore racial, ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in CA-CDI incidence.
Results
Regression modeling identified census tract–level socioeconomic measures as well as individual and medical measures that together accounted for 57% of the variance in CA-CDI rates. At the census tract level, socioeconomic factors associated with an increase in CA-CDI incidence included a high percentage of individuals lacking health insurance and a low percentage of individuals with low educational attainment. A subanalysis that included racial and ethnic designation revealed that ethnicity had no significant effect, but compared to white race, other races were significantly more likely to acquire CA-CDI.
Conclusions
Although this work reveals the role of certain socioeconomic and race and ethnicity risk factors in the incidence of CA-CDI, it also underscores the complex relationships that exist between socioeconomic status and access to health care."

Understanding the perceptions and beliefs of health care workers (HCWs) regarding glove use and associated hand hygiene (HH) may be informative and ultimately improve practice. Research in this area is limited. This study examined the practices and beliefs of HCWs surrounding the use of nonsterile gloves and HH before gloving.
Methods
The study was conducted at 3 large academic US hospitals using a parallel convergent mixed-method design. To estimate compliance rates, the gloving and HH practices of HCWs were observed at entry to patient rooms for 6 months. Interviews were conducted with 25 providers, nurses, and nursing assistants to investigate their beliefs and perceptions of these practices.
Results
Observed HH compliance rates before gloving were 42%, yet in the interviews most HCWs reported 100% compliance. Observed compliance with gloving before entering contact precaution rooms was 78%, although all HCWs reported always gloving for standard and contact precautions. Most HCWs described using gloves more often than necessary. HCWs generally use gloves for their own safety and sanitize hands before gloving for patient safety. Numerous barriers to compliance with HH before gloving were discussed, including beliefs that gloves provide enough protection.
Conclusions
HH and glove use are highly intertwined in clinical practice and should be considered jointly in infection prevention improvement efforts."

Evidence implicates textiles in health care as potential reservoirs of pathogens. No similar data exist for the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) industry. We investigated if coveralls worn by WWTP workers could present occupational infection risk.
Methods
We enumerated heterotrophic plate counts (HPCs), total coliforms, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile, and Acinetobacter spp on coverall swatches experimentally contaminated with raw, primary, secondary, and final effluent. Contaminated swatches were examined by culture-based methods after laundering, tumble-drying, and storing.
Results
Concentrations of microorganisms and efficacy of decontamination differed depending on the contaminating wastewater matrix and the organism. Laundering was an effective decontamination method for coveralls contaminated with all microorganisms, except HPCs. Tumble-drying resulted in statistically significant decreases for HPCs, P aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter. Increases in contamination after laundering were seen in Acinetobacter spp, in P aeruginosa when coverall swatches were contaminated with raw and final effluent, and in HPCs when contaminated with secondary effluent.
Discussion
Results suggest that solely laundering at 60°C for 25 minutes as per ASTM Standard F1449 may not always be an efficient means of controlling microorganisms on coveralls.
Conclusions
Clearer guidelines are needed to better protect WWTP workers."

Hand hygiene is crucial for preventing nosocomial infections; however, adherence rates need further attention. Prevention of nosocomial infections through regular hand hygiene monitoring and feedback is recommended by the World Health Organization. Technology holds the potential for achieving this goal. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of technological behavior monitoring innovations on hand hygiene adherence and their acceptance by healthcare professionals.
Methods
A rapid review of the literature was conducted. A literature search was performed in electronic databases (Cochrane Library, Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, PSYNDEX) and via citation tracking in November 2017. Records were screened for eligibility. Included studies were analyzed and synthesized in a narrative, tabular way.
Results
Overall, 2,426 studies were identified, and 12 were included. Findings indicated that behavior monitoring technology improves hand hygiene adherence, resulting in adherence increases between 6.40%-54.97%. The majority of systems provided real-time feedback. Factors influencing acceptance of technology by healthcare professionals include transparency and confidentiality, user attitude and environment, device function, and device usability.
Conclusions
Recognizing the importance of hand hygiene adherence, active communication between behavior monitoring technology and healthcare workers seems to mediate improvement in sustainable hand hygiene adherence behavior."

Hand hygiene compliance is low among anesthesia providers in the operating room, which places patients at risk of preventable infections. The goal of this project was to improve hand hygiene compliance by educating anesthesia providers on the World Health Organization's 5 indications for hand hygiene, and increasing access to hand hygiene products in the operating room.
Methods
Observations of hand hygiene in the operating room took place in 3 phases: preimplementation, postimplementation, and 60 days postimplementation.
Results
The results showed significant improvements in compliance for each of the 5 indications for hand hygiene as well as overall compliance. Each of the 3 phases of anesthesia demonstrated significant improvement as well. The results also showed a significant decrease in both glove use and use of the portable hand sanitizer device.
Discussion
Education and monitoring of hand hygiene among anesthesia providers in the operating room can improve hand hygiene compliance.
Conclusions
Although the use of the portable device declined, further studies could focus on observing single anesthesia providers instead of a preceptor/student combination, and also examine proximity to hand hygiene products in relation to compliance."

Methods
Our hospital had 17 positive and 82 negative cases of MERS-CoV between April 1, 2013, and June 3, 2013. The study evaluated the impact of these cases on the use of gloves, surgical masks, N95 respirators, alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and soap, as well as hand hygiene compliance rates.
Results
During the study, the use of personal protective equipment during MERS-CoV compared with theperiod before MERS-CoV increased dramatically from 2,947.4 to 10,283.9 per 1,000 patient-days (P<.0000001) for surgical masks and from 22 to 232 per 1,000 patient-days (P <.0000001) for N95 masks. The use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer and soap showed a significant increase in utilized amount (P<.0000001).

Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria outbreaks represent a major threat in intensive care units. Patients may then be exposed to drug-related direct toxicity during such outbreaks. The objective of this study was to explore the impact of an outbreak of imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (IR-AB) on renal outcomes.
Methods
We performed a before-and-after observational study in a French burn intensive care unit during an IR-AB outbreak: a 13-month period before (period A, October 2013-October 2014) and a 13-month period after outbreak control (period B, December 2014-December 2015). A total of 409 patients were included, 195 during period A and 214 during period B. The main endpoint was major adverse kidney events at day 90 (MAKE 90).

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is recognized as a significant challenge in health care. Identification of high-risk individuals is essential for the development of CDI prevention strategies. The objective of this study was to develop an easily implementable risk prediction model for hospital-onset CDI in patients receiving systemic antimicrobials.
Methods
This retrospective, case-control, multicenter study included adult patients admitted to Novant Health Forsyth Medical Center and Novant Health Presbyterian Medical Center from July 1, 2015, to July 1, 2017, who received systemic antibiotics. Cases were subjects with hospital-onset CDI; controls were subjects without a CDI diagnosis. Cases were matched 1:1 with controls by admitted medical unit type. Variables significantly associated with CDI were incorporated into a multivariate analysis. A logistic regression model was used to formulate a point-based risk prediction model. Positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were determined at various point cutoffs of the model. A receiver operating characteristic–area under the curve was created to assess the discrimination of the model.
Results
A total of 200 subjects (100 cases and 100 controls) were included. Most patients were Caucasian and female. Risk factors for CDI identified and incorporated into the model included age ≥70 years (adjusted odds ratio, 1.89; 95% confidence interval 1.05-3.43; P = .0326) and recent hospitalization in the past 90 days (adjusted odds ratio, 3.55; 95% confidence interval 1.90-6.83; P < .0001). Sensitivity and specificity were 76% and 49%, respectively, for scores ≥2 and 20% and 93%, respectively, for a score of 6. Diagnostic performance of various score cutoffs for the model indicated that a score ≥2 was associated with the highest accuracy (63%). The receiver operating characteristic–area under the curve was 0.7.
Discussion
We developed a simple-to-implement hospital-onset CDI risk model that included only independent risks that can be obtained immediately on presentation to the health care facility. Despite this, the model had fair discriminatory power. Similar risk factors were found in previously developed models; however, the utility of these models is limited owing to the difficulty of assessing other included risk factors and the inclusion of risk factors that cannot be evaluated until the patient is discharged from the health care facility.
Conclusions
Identification of hospitalized patients who are receiving systemic antibiotics, are ≥70 years old, and were recently admitted to the hospital in the past 90 days may allow for an easily implementable hospital-onset CDI risk prevention strategy."

In October 2013, a protocol for the decolonization of Staphylococcal aureus in elective orthopedic, neurosurgical, and cardiac surgeries was implemented in an effort to further decrease post-operative infections rates. We surveyed patients undergoing these procedures between November 2014 and April 2015 using an anonymous, voluntary, Likert-scale survey; survey questions targeted compliance with the protocol as well as barriers to protocol completion.
Results
A sample of 546 patients (n=1289, 42%) undergoing elective neurosurgical and orthopedic surgeries completed surveys. Respondents had 85% compliance with USD. Insufficient time prior to the procedure to complete the protocol was the largest barrier to USD completion.
Conclusions
This study provides evidence that USD is acceptable to patients, and that the biggest barriers are logistical."

abstract = "Background
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continues to be reported from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Data on the phenomenon of intermittent positive results for MERS-CoV on reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with negative results in between are lacking. Here we describe cases with intermittent positive MERS-CoV test results and highlight the required number of tests to rule out or rule in MERS-CoV infection based on a large retrospective cohort of patients with confirmed MERS-CoV.
Methods
This analysis included cases admitted between January 2014 and December 2017. The included patients had a minimum of 3 nasopharyngeal MERS-CoV RT-PCR tests for confirmation and needed 2 negative samples for MERS-CoV evaluated 48 hours apart with clinical improvement or stabilization apart to ensure clearance.
Results
A total of 408 patients with positive MERS-CoV test results were treated at the referring hospital. We excluded 72 patients who had only 1 swab result available in the system and were treated in the initial years of the disease. Of the remaining 336 patients, 300 (89%) had a positive result after 1 swab, 324 (96.5%) had a positive result after 2 consecutive swabs, and 328 (97.6%) had a positive result after 3 consecutive swabs. Of the total cases, 46 (13.7%) had a positive MERS-CoV test then a negative test, followed by positive test results.
Conclusions
Our data indicate that 2 to 3 nasopharyngeal samples are needed to produce the highest yield of positive results for MERS-CoV. In addition, 2 negative results 48 hours apart with clinical improvement or stabilization are needed to clear patients from MERS-CoV. Evaluation of the yield of sputum samples is needed to assess the effectiveness against nasopharyngeal swabs."

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a leading cause of hospital-associated infections. Antibiotic stewardship, environmental disinfection, and reduction of transmission via health care workers are the major modes of CDI prevention within hospitals.
Methods
The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of the environment in the spread of CDI within hospital rooms. Bed tracing of positive-CDI inpatients was performed to detect the strength of association to specific rooms. Environmental cultures were conducted to identify adequacy of environmental C difficile (CD) spores. Whole-genome sequencing was performed to evaluate the degree of CD relatedness.
Results
Bed tracing performed for 211 CDI patients showed a limited list of high-burden rooms. Environmental cultures for surfaces disinfected with a sporicidal agent were almost entirely negative, whereas the floors were positive for CDI in 15% of the studied patient rooms. Whole-genome sequencing did not detect any close genetic relatedness.
Conclusions
Unlike in an outbreak setting, bed tracing did not yield conclusive results of room reservoirs. The C diff Banana Broth culture was inexpensive, sensitive, and easy to incubate under aerobic conditions. Sporicidal disinfectants were effective in eliminating CD from the environment. CD spores were found on floors and hard-to-clean surfaces."

abstract = "Background
Hand hygiene prevents cross-infection and is the most effective defense against contagious diseases. Preschoolers, without proper hand hygiene skills, are a vulnerable group to such diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether hand hygiene compliance training of preschoolers in Hong Kong improves their hand hygiene knowledge and performance, and whether the training reduces their absenteeism resulting from influenza symptoms.
Methods
This was a quasi-experimental study with a pretest-posttest design. A total of 110 preschoolers participated in a program consisting of 4 training sessions on hand hygiene. Before and after the program, their hand hygiene knowledge was assessed by 10 true or false questions, and their handwashing skills were assessed by photos of their hands taken before and after handwashing. Before handwashing, a fluorescent stain gel was used to cover their hands. To determine whether a causal relationship existed between compliance and absenteeism, the preschoolers’ absenteeism data were collected during a period of 3 months for analysis.
Results
Significant differences were found in hand hygiene knowledge on handwashing steps, duration, and after playing with toys. Percentage increases were recorded for 8 questions. There was significant improvement in hand hygiene performance on the fronts and the backs of fingers, thumbs, and fingertips (P < .05). The findings showed a decrease in absence rates with influenza symptoms for the month before (31%), during (30%), and after (25%) the completion of the program in all participating schools.
Discussion
After the training program, the participants’ hand hygiene knowledge and performance considerably improved. They washed their hands more thoroughly and there was a significant reduction in absences owing to influenza.
Conclusions
Good cooperation between schools and families is found to be important in helping students build positive attitudes and habits, even in performing simple routines like hand hygiene."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of a focused multivector ultraviolet (FMUV) system employing shadowless delivery with a 90-second disinfection cycle for patient care equipment inside and outside the operating room (OR) suite without manual-chemical disinfection.
Methods
A 5-point multisided sampling protocol was utilized to measure the microbial burden on objects inside and outside the OR environment in a 3-phase nonrandomized observational study. Surface sampling was performed pre- and postdisinfection in between cases (IBCs) to assess the performance of manual-chemical disinfection. FMUV system performance was separately assessed pre- and postdisinfection before the first case and IBCs. Additionally, visibly clean high-touch objects were sampled outside the OR, and the microbial burden reductions after FMUV disinfection were quantified without manual-chemical disinfection.
Results
Manual-chemical disinfection reduced the active microbial burden on sampled objects IBCs by 52.8%-90.9% (P < .05). FMUV reduced the active microbial burden by 92%-97.7% (P < .0001) before the firstcase and IBCs combined, and 96.3%-99.6% (P < .0001) on objects outside the OR without chemical disinfection.
Conclusions
Five-point multisided sampling proved effective for assessing disinfection performance on all exterior sides of equipment. FMUV produced significant overall reductions of the microbial burden on patient care equipment in all study phases and independent of manual cleaning and chemical disinfection."

Surgical site infections (SSIs) following hip fracture surgeries have profound clinical and economic implications. The study aims to analyze the effect of an integrative SSI prevention care bundle on the SSI incidence among surgical hip patients. The study also aims to examine the association between SSI and mortality, readmission, duration of hospitalization, and hospital cost.
Methods
A retrospective cohort study was carried out to assess the incidence of SSI in an acute hip unit in Singapore from January 2015 to September 2017. Patients who developed SSI fell into the exposure group, whereas patients without SSI fell into the nonexposure group. A comparison of the incidence of mortality, readmission, length of stay, and inpatient bill size was conducted between the 2 groups.
Results
Among 758 hip surgeries performed during the study period, 14 (1.8%) SSIs were documented. Compared with patients with no SSI, patients with SSI were 4.27times more likely to be readmitted within 30days, had 2.47times longer length of stay, and 2.15times the inpatient bill size.
Conclusions
An integrative care bundle that capitalizes on the expertise of a multidisciplinary team has promoted shared responsibility and proven to be effective in preventing SSIs while contributing to better patient outcomes within the unit."

This study evaluates the impact of a visible-light continuous environmental disinfection (CED) system on microbial surface contamination and surgical site infections (SSI) in an OR.
Methods
Samples from 25 surfaces within 2 contiguous ORs sharing an air supply were obtained after manual cleaning on multiple days before and after a visible-light CED system installation in 1 of the ORs. Samples were incubated and enumerated as total colony-forming units. SSIs in both ORs, and a distant OR, were tracked for 1 year prior to and 1 year after the visible-light CED system installation.
Results
There was an 81% (P = .017) and 49% (P = .015) reduction in total colony-forming units after the visible-light CED system installation in the OR in which the system was installed, and in the contiguous OR, respectively.

There is little information regarding consumer knowledge of health care–associated infection (HAI). Furthermore, it is unclear how meaningful publicly reported HAI data is to consumers, how they may use it, and the most appropriate format for data presentation. The purpose of this study was to explore consumer knowledge and attitudes toward HAI and public reporting.
Methods
A qualitative study design, characterized by a series of semistructured interviews, was undertaken with purposively selected, adult elective surgical inpatients at a large metropolitan acute hospital. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Analysis of the data were conducted using thematic analysis.
Results
Twenty interviews were conducted. The 5 major themes identified were: (1) awareness through experience, (2) focus on current illness, (3) patient contribution to infection prevention, (4) sources and mode of information, and (5) influence on choice of hospital.
Discussion
We found broad variation in knowledge, sources of information, and preferences for the type and delivery of information. A significant cohort of participants preferred not to be informed, whereas others were neutral or only mildly interested.
Conclusions
If public reporting of HAI data is to be aimed at consumers, further engagement with consumers is crucial to ensure the information provided is fit for purpose."

Objective
Obstetric-related infections are a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Our team implemented an evidence-based infection control bundle aimed at reducing obstetric-related infections at our facility.
Methods
A multidisciplinary team at Tripler Army Medical Center developed, implemented, and evaluated an evidence-based maternal safety infection control bundle (MSICB) on labor and delivery aimed at reducing the incidence of surgical site infections (SSI) and chorioamnionitis. Adenosine triphosphate testing of patient care–related surfaces was performed while behavioral and environmental interventions were implemented. Incidence rates for chorioamnionitis, SSI, and endometritis were compared between pre- and during-MSICB implementation using Fisher exact test and Poisson regression, adjusting for year and quarter. The decision science analysts at US Army Medical Command, Fort Sam Houston, Texas responsible for our facility utilized diagnosis-related group and ICD-10 Procedure Coding to determine infection-related costs.
Results
Prior to implementation of the MSICB, the rates of chorioamnionitis, SSI, and endometritis in the first half of 2016 were 6.3%, 3.4%, and 0.4%, respectively. After implementation of the MSICB, in the first 6 months of 2017, the rates of chorioamnionitis and SSI decreased to 1.7% and 1.0%, respectively, with no change in the rate of endometritis. The rate was significantly lower after implementation for chorioamnionitis (P < .001), and there was a statistically nonsignificant decrease for SSI (P = .060) and no difference for postpartum endometritis (P = 1.00). These reductions resulted in an estimated net cost savings of $671,218.
Conclusions
A multidisciplinary approach with evidence-based strategies resulted in a significant decrease (P < .001) in chorioamnionitis and a statistically nonsignificant decrease (P = .060) in the SSI rate, which resulted in a significant cost savings for the hospital. There was no change in our postpartum endometritis rate."

Hospitalized patients on isolation precautions are reported to have less frequent health care provider (HCP) visits owing to time required to don and doff personal protective equipment (PPE). Thus, placement on isolation precautions leads to negative patient perception and affects their care.
Methods
A “Red Box” that extended 3 feet beyond the door was marked in 50 patient rooms of a tertiary care hospital and used for patient communication by HCPs without PPE. HCP and patient perceptions of the Red Box were studied via a survey and personal interviews. Compliance was also observed by “secret shoppers.” Rates of health care–associated infections (HAIs) were monitored.
Results
Over a 1-year period, HCPs reported improved patient communication, utilization of time, and increased interactions. HCPs used the Red Box to communicate with patients 76% of the time. In 92% of the cases, HCPs remembered not to use PPE while in the Red Box and were observed 80% of the time using PPE when venturing beyond the Red Box. Patients reported improved frequency of HCP contact and satisfaction. HAIs in these units did not show any increase compared with those in prior years.
Conclusions
HCP interaction and communication with patients on isolation precautions improved with the reengineering of the patient environment in the form of the Red Box. HAI rates did not increase with this intervention."

abstract = "Background
Increases in liver transplant patient perioperative acuity have resulted in frail immunosuppressed patients at elevated risk for nosocomial infections. Avoiding central line–associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) is paramount to facilitate transplantation and post-transplant recovery. In 2015, our liver transplant intensive care unit (ICU) CLABSIs accounted for more than 25% of all CLABSI at our institution. We therefore undertook a multidisciplinary collaborative among clinical epidemiology, nursing, transplant surgery, and critical care to eliminate CLABSI events.
Methods
From 2014-2016, using Lean methodology and plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles, 14 interventions were implemented in the liver transplant ICU. Interventions were aimed at infection prevention, care standardization, and team-based monitoring. Implementation used quality improvement methodology including audit and feedback, education, standardization, multidisciplinary stakeholder involvement, and PDSA cycles. Process measures were monitored and audited. CLABSI rates per 1,000 central venous catheter (CVC) days were tracked by clinical epidemiology.
Results
During the intervention, 901 CVC catheter audits were completed. Improvements were seen on all process measures, and complete compliance increased from 25%-67%. CLABSI infection rates dropped from 4.2 to 1.8 in 1,000 CVC days, with an average of less than 1 CLABSI per month. This marked a 61.2% annual reduction, which correlated with an estimated $935,000 annual savings.
Conclusion
Concerted ongoing multidisciplinary collaboratives are essential to minimize CLABSI and optimize value and quality in a challenging, high-acuity patient population."

Central line–associated bloodstream infection is the most common infection associated with healthcare in preterm infants. The purpose of this 18-month cross-sectional study was to evaluate the effectiveness of bundle applications in the prevention of umbilical venous catheter (UVC)–associated bloodstream infections.
Methods
This study included patients in whom UVCs were inserted and who were diagnosed with central line–associated bloodstream infection between July 1, 2016, and December 31, 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria. During the second 9-month period of the study (April 1, 2017, to December 31, 2017), bundles were implemented.
Results
In the prebundle period, 589 patients were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, and 6,769 hospitalization days and 485 UVC days were recorded. Similarly, during the bundle period, 508 patients were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, and 7,789 hospitalization days and 508 UVC days were recorded. The UVC-associated bloodstream infection rate was 12.4 per 1,000 catheter days in the prebundle period and decreased to 3.9 per 1,000 catheter days in the bundle period. Thus, after introducing bundle applications, the rate of infection decreased by 68% (P < .01).

Urinary tract–related bloodstream infection (BSI) is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and financial costs. We examined the role of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions on developing this condition among US Veterans.
Methods
We conducted a matched case-control study among adult inpatients admitted to 4 Veterans Affairs hospitals. Cases were patients with a positive urine culture result obtained 48hours or longer after admission and a blood culture obtained within 14days of the urine culture, which grew the same organism. Controls included patients with a positive urine culture result who were at risk for but did not develop BSI (control group 1) and patients without a positive urine culture result who were present in the facility at the time of case diagnosis (control group 2).
Results
Compared with the findings in control group 1, receipt of RBCs was not significantly associated with urinary tract–related BSI (odds ratio, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.07; P = .07). However, we found increased odds of urinary tract–related BSI compared with the results in patients without infection (control group 2) (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.17; P < .001).
Conclusions
Given the heightened risk of urinary tract–related BSI associated with receiving a greater number of RBC transfusions, adhering to recommendations to transfuse the minimum amount of blood products necessary may minimize the risk of this infection among Veterans."

We determined the incidence and circumstances of needlestick injuries and other body substance exposures among police officers in a city police department.
Methods
We analyzed data extracted from the city's centralized human resource database on all incidents from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2016, and characterized their circumstances. We calculated the annual incidence of needlestick injuries per 1,000 officers and per 10,000 reactive calls. We ran a Poisson regression model to determine the trend in the annual incidence over time.
Results
We found 13 needlestick injuries and 37 additional body substance exposures involving city police officers. Needlestick injuries most commonly occurred during pat-down searches and searches of property or vehicles; 9 source persons tested positive for hepatitis C. The annual incidence of needlestick injuries ranged from 0-5.1 per 1,000 police officers and from 0-2.5 per 10,000 reactive calls for service without a significant trend. Most body substance exposures consisted of spitting, human bites, and other contact with blood. No incidents reportedly led to transmission of bloodborne viruses.
Conclusions
Although these appear to be rare events, police officers in this department are at risk for needlestick injuries and other body substance exposures. We recommended engineering, administrative, and personal protective equipment control improvements."

abstract = "Background
Valid data are a crucial aspect of infection prevention and control programs. The aim of this study was to examine the accuracy of routine reporting in the Iranian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System in intensive care units.
Methods
A blinded retrospective review of general intensive care unit medical records was performed with a standard case-finding form. Infection control nurses (ICNs) were also interviewed to explore possible reasons for differences.
Results
The results of 951 events in 856 medical records were assessed. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of routine surveillance were 27.5%, 97.2%, 69%, and 85.3%, respectively. The results indicate 82.2%, 68.4%, 62.7%, and 57.3% under-reporting of surgical site infections, urinary tract infections, bloodstream infections, and pneumonia, respectively. Over-reporting of approximately 8%-15% was detected in 4 types of health care–associated infections (HAIs). Misinterpretation of HAI definition, high ICN workload, and inactivity of infection control link nurses were the main causes of inaccurate reporting.
Conclusions
Under and over-reporting of HAIs are main challenges of HAIs reporting in Iran. Developing guidelines, empowering ICNs through specialized training and activating infection control link nurses are necessary to achieve more accurate data in the Iranian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System."

Hand hygiene is monitored by direct observation to improve practice, but this approach can potentially cause information, selection, and confounding bias, threatening the validity of findings. The aim of this study was to identify and describe the potential biases in hand hygiene compliance monitoring by direct observation; develop a typology of biases and propose improvements to reduce bias; and increase the validity of compliance measurements.
Methods
This systematic review of hospital-based intervention studies used direct observation to monitor health care workers’ hand hygiene compliance.
Results
Seventy-one publications were eligible for review. None was free of bias. Selection bias was present in all studies through lack of data collection on the weekends (n = 61, 86%) and at night (n = 46, 65%) and observations undertaken in single-specialty settings (n = 35, 49%). We observed inconsistency of terminology, definitions of hand hygiene opportunity, criteria, tools, and descriptions of the data collection. Frequency of observation, duration, or both were not described or were unclear in 58 (82%) publications. Observers were trained in 56 (79%) studies. Inter-rater reliability was measured in 26 (37%) studies.
Conclusions
Published research of hand hygiene compliance measured by direct observation lacks validity. Hand hygiene should be measured using methods that produce a valid indication of performance and quality. Standardization of methodology would expedite comparison of hand hygiene compliance between clinical settings and organizations."

We describe the investigation undertaken and the measures adopted to control a Serratia marcescens outbreak in the neonatology unit of La Paz University Hospital in Madrid, Spain.
Methods
Weekly rectal and pharyngeal screenings for S marcescens were performed in the neonates starting after detection of the outbreak. Environmental samples and samples from health care workers (HCWs) were obtained for microbiological analysis. An unmatched case-control study was carried out to investigate risk factors for infection/colonization.
Results
The outbreak began in June 2016 and ended in March 2017, affecting a total of 59 neonates. Twenty-five (42.37%) neonates sustained an infection, most frequently conjunctivitis and sepsis. Multivariate logistic regression identified the following risk factors: parenteral nutrition (odds ratio [OR], 103.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 11.9-894.8), history of previous radiography (OR, 15.3; 95% CI, 2.4-95.6), and prematurity (OR, 5.65; 95% CI, 1.5-21.8). Various measures were adopted to control the outbreak, such as strict contact precautions, daily multidisciplinary team meetings, cohorting, allocation of dedicated staff, unit disinfection, and partial closure. Hands of HCWs were the main suspected mechanism of transmission, based on the inconclusive results of the environmental investigation and the high number of HCWs and procedures performed in the unit.
Conclusions
S marcescens spreads easily in neonatology units, mainly in neonatal intensive care units, and is often difficult to control, requiring a multidisciplinary approach. Strict measures, including cohorting and medical attention by exclusive staff, are often needed to get these outbreaks under control."

The emergence of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) poses significant challenges for antibiotic therapy. We characterized the epidemiology of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) co-colonization that may facilitate resistance transfer and vancomycin-resistant S aureus emergence among nursing facility patients.
Methods
We cultured newly admitted patient hands, nares, oropharynx, groin, and perianal region plus wounds and device insertion sites, if applicable, upon enrollment at day 14, day 30, and monthly follow-up up to 6 months. Demographic, comorbidity, and antimicrobial use data were collected. Functional status was assessed at each visit using the Physical Self-Maintenance Scale. Multinomial logistic regression was performed to determine factors predictive of co-colonization.
Results
Five hundred eight patients were enrolled, with an average follow-up time of 28.5days. Prevalence of MRSA/VRE co-colonization, MRSA alone, and VRE alone was 8.7%, 8.9%, and 23.4%, respectively. Independent predictors of co-colonization included indwelling device use (odds ratio [OR] = 5.5 [2.2-13.7]), recent antibiotic use (OR = 2.5 [1.4-4.2]), diabetes (OR = 1.9 [1.0-3.8]), and the presence of open wounds (OR = 1.9 [1.0-3.6]).

Population ascertainment of postoperative urinary tract infections (UTIs) is time-consuming and expensive, as it often requires manual chart review. Using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program UTI status of patients who underwent an operation at the University of Colorado Hospital, we sought to develop an algorithm for identifying UTIs using data from the electronic health record.
Methods
Data were split into training (operations occurring between 2013-2015) and test (operations in 2016) sets. A binomial generalized linear model with an elastic-net penalty was used to fit the model and carry out variables selection. International classification of disease codes, common procedural terminology codes, antibiotics, catheterization, and common procedural terminology-specific UTI event rates were included as predictors. The Youden's J statistic was used to determine the optimal classification threshold.
Results
Of 6,840 patients, 134 (2.0%) had a UTI. The model achieved 92% specificity, 80% sensitivity, 100% negative predictive value, 16% positive predictive value, and an area under the curve of 0.94 using a decision threshold of 0.03.
Conclusions
A model with 14 predictors from the electronic health record identifies UTIs well, and it could be used to scale up UTI surveillance or to estimate the impact of large-scale interventions on UTI rates."

Good infection prevention is an important aspect of quality of medical care. The aim was to evaluate infection prevention and control (IPC) performance among Dutch general practitioners (GPs).
Methods
Based on the current national IPC guidelines for GPs, a self-administered anonymous online questionnaire was developed and sent to GPs in the Nijmegen region of the Netherlands. Thirty-two questions were constructed to survey characteristics of GPs’ offices and assess current performance of IPC measures.
Results
One hundred questionnaires were included in our analysis. The preferred method of hand hygiene was soap and water (56%) versus alcohol-based handrub (44%). The cleaning of nondisposable, noncritical, semicritical, and critical instruments was consistent with national guideline recommendations or superior to them in 100%, 49%, and 97% of cases, respectively. An average of 57% of GPs reported environmental cleaning frequencies that were compliant with the national guidelines or superior to them. Personal protective equipment was available in 62% of GPs’ practices but used in only 25% of home visits to patients.
Conclusions
Not all national IPC guidelines seem to be followed to the fullest extent. The current situation indicates there is room for potential improvement regarding implementation of IPC measures in GPs’ offices. Area-specific guidelines and continuous medical education regarding IPC may help improve the situation."

Stethoscopes harbor pathogens that can be transferred to patients when proper sanitary measures are not taken. Our aim was to assess medical provider stethoscope cleaning and hand hygiene in an emergency department setting.
Methods
The frequency and methods of stethoscope cleaning during and after provider-patient encounters were observed anonymously in an emergency department of the VA San Diego Healthcare System.
Results
Among the total of 426 encounters, 115 (26.9%) involved the use of a personal stethoscope. In 15 of these 115 encounters (13.0%), the provider placed a glove over the stethoscope before patient contact. In 13 of these 115 encounters (11.3%), the provider cleaned the stethoscope with an alcohol swab after patient interaction. Stethoscope hygiene with water and a hand towel before patient interaction was observed in 5 of these 115 encounters (4.3%). Hand sanitizer use or handwashing was observed in 213 of the 426 encounters (50.0%) before patient interaction. Gloves were used before patient interaction in 206 of these 426 encounters (48.4%). Hand sanitizer or handwashing was used in 332 of the 426 encounters (77.9%) after patient interaction.
Conclusions
Rates of stethoscope and hand hygiene performance were lower than expected. Further investigation of stethoscope contamination and the associated risk of nosocomial infection are needed. Perhaps clearer guidelines on proper stethoscope cleaning would reduce this risk."

This cross-sectional study was conducted at Virginia Commonwealth University Health System, an 860-bed tertiary care academic center located in Richmond, Virginia, where a well-resourced ASP has been in place for 2 decades. A survey consisting of 12 questions was administered to nursing staff via REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) in February 2018.
Results
A total of 159 survey responses were included in the study. The results demonstrated gaps in knowledge regarding antibiotic stewardship (AS) and highlighted the importance of improving communication between nurses and ASPs. Overall, 102 (64.15%) of the study participants indicated familiarity with AS. Time constraints and concerns over physician pushback were identified as major barriers to participation.
Conclusions
Many nurses were unaware of our center's ASP. Nurses identified activities falling within their daily workflow as potential areas for contribution to ASPs. Key barriers to participation were also identified. These data will inform efforts to engage nursing in AS activities at our medical center."

Methods
We performed an observational, cross-sectional, anonymous study of patient-provider interactions, assessing practitioners’ frequency and methods of stethoscope and hand disinfection practices.
Results
Stethoscopes were disinfected in 18% of 400 observed interactions, with less than 4% verified as conforming to CDC guidelines. None was disinfected before patient examinations involving open chest or abdominal wounds, as recommended by the CDC. Hands were cleaned before and after encounters 27 times (6.8%) but were not cleaned at all in 231 (58%) encounters, although gloves were worn in 197 (85.3%) of these cases.
Discussion
Stethoscope disinfection is grossly overlooked, possibly jeopardizing patient safety, particularly in acute care interactions. Periodic stethoscope disinfection, although inconvenient, helps reduce bacterial contamination and may reduce health care–associated infections.
Conclusions
Stethoscopes were disinfected per CDC guidelines in less than 4% of encounters and were not disinfected at all in 82% of encounters. Although hands were rarely cleaned (6.8%) per CDC guidelines, gloves were usually worn, but no convenient stethoscope equivalent exists. Stethoscope cleanliness must be addressed."

Improving hand hygiene compliance among healthcare professionals is the most effective way to reduce healthcare–acquired infections. Electronic systems developed to increase hand hygiene performance show promise but might not maintain staff participation over time. In this study, we investigated an intermittent deployment strategy to overcome potentially declining participation levels.
Methods
An electronic monitoring system was deployed 3times at 6-month intervals on a musculoskeletal rehabilitation nursing unit in Toronto. Each deployment lasted 4 consecutive weeks. Each wall-mounted soap and hand rub dispenser was outfitted with an activation counter to assess the impact of system deployments on overall handwashing activity.
Results
System deployments took place in October 2016, April 2017, and October 2017. A total of 76,130 opportunities were recorded, with an aggregate hand hygiene performance of 67.43%. A total of 515,156 dispenser activations were recorded. There was a significant increase in aggregate dispenser use with every deployment and a decrease over several weeks following each withdrawal. Participation was high at the beginning of each deployment and declined during each deployment but was restored to a high level with the start of the next deployment.
Conclusions
Intermittent deployment of an electronic monitoring intervention counteracts potential declines in participation rates sometimes seen with continuous system use. However, adoption of this strategy requires the acceptance of lower periods of performance between each deployment."

The drivers behind Clostridium difficile testing are not well understood.
Methods
C difficile testing orders were reviewed. An algorithm that sequentially considered the presence of diarrhea, leukocytosis, fever, and laxative use was created. Tests deemed potentially inappropriate were discussed with the ordering team.
Results
Of 128 orders reviewed, 62% (n = 79) were appropriate. Patients whose testing was deemed inappropriate had longer lengths of stay. Diarrhea and laxative use were common and similarly distributed in those appropriately or inappropriately tested. The most commonly cited reason for ordering an inappropriate test was the reporting of diarrhea to the clinician by the patient or nursing that was not documented in the electronic health record. The next most common reason was clinician perception of risk. Demographics, laxative use, fever, leukocytosis, and diarrhea were similarly distributed between patients testing positive or negative by C difficile polymerase chain reaction.
Discussion
The discriminating value of diarrhea or laxative use in assessing for C difficile infection is poor. Multiple streams of information add to the complexities of decision making around C difficile testing. Inconsistent definitions of diarrhea likely contribute to this complexity. Clinician-perceived risk to the patient, partially driven by length of stay, may be a large driver of testing practices.
Conclusions
Without understanding the knowledge, attitudes, and values that underlie clinician behavior, interventions targeting ordering practices may not succeed."

There has been little research on the performance of laminar airflow (LAF) and mixing ventilation (MV) systems regarding clean airflow distribution near a surgical patient in operating rooms (ORs). The objective of this study was to examine the performance of LAF and MV systems in ORs at St Olavs Hospital in Norway.
Methods
Experimental measurements were conducted in 2 ORs equipped with LAF and MV systems.
Results
Under real operating conditions, airflow distribution from the LAF system was disrupted, and airflow velocity became significantly lower than that of MV above the lying patient. Airflow pattern was observed as distributed vertically downward and horizontally with LAF and MV, respectively. Turbulence intensity of supply airflow from LAF was much lower than that of MV.
Conclusions
The airflow distribution by LAF system in close proximity to a patient is greatly affected by thermal plumes generated above incisions by both patients and surgical facilities. The effect of surgical facilities on airflow distribution by using MV is not significant compared to LAF ventilation. New guidelines are needed for the design of clean airflow distribution systems in the vicinity of surgical patients in ORs."

abstract = "Background
This study aimed to evaluate the factors influencing seasonal influenza vaccination uptake among different health care professional groups.
Methods
A single-center, cross-sectional survey using a standardized anonymous, self-administered questionnaire to assess knowledge, attitudes, and uptake of seasonal influenza vaccination was used. Associations between respective health care groups and vaccination acceptance were then assessed.
Results
In total, 3,873 health care workers completed the questionnaire. Of these, 7% were administrative staff, 17% were allied health staff, 7% were ancillary staff, 11% were medical staff, and 58% were nursing staff. The overall vaccination rate for the Southern Hemisphere 2015 influenza season was 82%. In a multivariate logistic regression model, after controlling for gender and presence of chronic disease, associated factors for accepting influenza vaccination were age, education level of bachelor degree or higher, preference for vaccination provided by mobile teams, having 1-50 patient contacts per week, and belief in the potential severity of influenza and vaccine safety (P < .05). In contrast, factors negatively associated with vaccination acceptance included being a medical staff member or allied health staff member, living with family members under the age of 16, fear of adverse reactions, and disbelief in vaccination effectiveness (P < .05).
Conclusions
Although vaccine coverage in Singapore has been high, our findings provide guidance for the development of strategies to further improve vaccine coverage among different groups of health care workers."

This study aimed to examine the association between colonizing respiratory tract organism and frequency, duration, and time between subsequent hospitalizations among hospitalized patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).
Methods
This retrospective cohort study of 312 CF patients from 2 New York City hospitals (2006-2016) examined the effects of colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) or methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA), co-colonization on incidence of hospitalization, time to next hospitalization, and total length of stay (LOS).
Results
Annual rate of subsequent hospitalizations was highest in patients with P aeruginosa: adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRRs) were 2.75 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.72-4.41) for P aeruginosa versus MSSA, 2.57 (95% CI, 1.52-4.31) for co-colonization versus MSSA, and 1.77 (95% CI, 1.04-3.01) for P aeruginosa versus MRSA. Time to readmission was shortest for P aeruginosa: aIRRs were 1.75 (95% CI, 1.05-2.94) for MRSA versus P aeruginosa, 1.64 (95% CI, 1.03-2.59) for MSSA versus P aeruginosa, and 1.61 (95% CI, 1.04-2.47) for co-colonization versus P aeruginosa. LOS was longest for P aeruginosa: aIRRs were 3.41 (95% CI, 2.19-5.32) for P aeruginosa versus MSSA, 1.66 (95% CI, 1.01-2.75) for co-colonization versus MSSA, 2.50 (95% CI, 1.58-3.93) for P aeruginosa versus MRSA, and 2.05 (95% CI, 1.32-3.18) for P aeruginosa versus co-colonization.
Conclusions
CF patients with P aeruginosa alone experienced more hospitalizations, longer LOS, and shorter time to readmission versus patients with S aureus or both organisms."

The main study aim was to track infections, evaluate performance, and identify opportunities for improved practice since infections, especially those associated with multidrug-resistant organisms, are the second most common cause of death among end-stage renal disease patients.
Methods
This study describes the establishment of baseline dialysis event surveillance at a large dialysis center. Every month, the dialysis center staff reported the total number of maintenance hemodialysis patients to the department of infection control and hospital epidemiology. The surveillance system for dialysis events included monthly monitoring of hemodialysis patients in outpatient settings for positive blood cultures, intravenous antimicrobial initiation, and local vascular access infections.
Results
We calculated the pooled mean rates of positive blood cultures, intravenous antimicrobial initiation, and local vascular access infections during the period from June 1, 2014 to September 30, 2017. Results indicated more dialysis events were attributed to the CVC than any other dialysis vascular access. Regardless of vascular access type, intravenous antimicrobial initiation was the most commonly reported dialysis-associated event.
Conclusions
Dialysis events surveillance can be used to produce a decrease in both morbidity and mortality rates in hemodialysis patients."

The purpose of this study was to systematically review the literature to describe nurses’ knowledge and practice of and attitude toward infection control and prevention standards.
Methods
In the present systematic review, 4 electronic databases were searched from the inception of databases through March 2018. Quality of included studies was assessed using the Hoy tool.
Results
Eighteen studies conducted on 4,577 employed nurses and nursing students entered the final stage. Results indicated that nurses in most studies had adequate knowledge (n = 10, 40%-90%) and positive attitude (n = 4, 37%-100%). However, most studies reflected average and poor nursing practices with regard to adherence to infection control and prevention standards. The most frequent recommendations proposed for improving nurses’ knowledge, attitude, and practice included periodic training via scientific conferences and relevant practical courses (n = 12), combining up-to-date theoretical and practical programs (n = 6), and training at the beginning of hospital employment (n = 4).
Conclusions
The results of the present study indicate that although nurses in most studies had adequate knowledge of and positive attitude toward health care–associated infections, because of average and poor practices, they need systematic and integrated implementation of the presented recommendations."

Sustaining healthcare-associated infection (HAI) prevention practices is complex. We examined the use of Kamishibai Cards (K Cards) as a tool to encourage compliance interactions between leaders and staff.
Methods
We explored one unit of a children's hospital to assess acceptability of K Cards. Interactions were recorded (n = 14), and interviews were conducted (n = 22). We used the Health Belief Model (HBM) for analyses. Central line utilization, bundle compliance and rates of HAIs were also examined.
Results
Staff members consider K Card interactions reminders of bundle elements and acceptable for creating positive interactions. Although no causal inference can be made, during K Card implementation, CLABSI rates dropped from 1.83 in 2015 to 0.0 through June 2018. Central line utilization decreased by 3%.
Discussion
Moving beyond theory to providing practical sustainability tools is an important implementation step. Although our findings are not generalizable, capturing what occurred on one unit provides opportunity to discover how key leadership factors (communication and leadership style) influence the uptake, acceptability and sustained adoption of evidence-based practices.
Conclusions
K Cards are a practical tool to sustain evidence-based practices and promote communication between leadership and staff - keeping compliance on the minds of frontline workers."

Currently, most US states have adopted legislation requiring hospitals to submit health care–associated infection (HAI) data. We evaluated the perceived impact of state HAI laws on infection prevention and control (IPC) departments.
Methods
A web-based survey of a national sample of all non-veteran hospitals enrolled in the National Healthcare Safety Network was conducted in fall 2011. Variations in IPC department resources and characteristics in states with and without laws were compared by use of χ², Mann-Whitney (Wilcoxon), and Student t tests. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify increases or decreases, versus no change, in perceived resources, time, influence, and visibility of the IPC department in states with and without HAI laws.
Results
Overall, 1,036 IPC departments provided complete data (30% response rate); 755 (73%) were located in states with laws. Respondents in states with reporting laws were more likely to report less time for routine IPC activities (odds ratio, 1.61; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-2.31) and less visibility of the IPC department (odds ratio, 1.70; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-2.58) than respondents in states without laws, after controlling for geographic region, setting, and the presence of a hospital epidemiologist.
Conclusions
Respondents in states with laws reported negative effects on their IPC department, beyond what was required by federal mandates. Further research should examine resources necessary to comply with state HAI laws and evaluate unintended consequences of state HAI laws."

The sterile processing of surgical instruments and equipment is an essential part of surgical operations. Although clean instruments prevent infections, little is known about the departments that conduct this work. We sought to describe sterile processing departments (SPDs) and to identify factors impacting them.
Methods
We analyzed data from 22 qualitative interviews of staff and managers and a quantitative benchmarking database.
Results
Qualitative results indicated 4 primary factors impacting sterile processing work: (1) role and visibility, (2) relationships and communication with other departments and vendors, (3) staffing and management, and (4) technical problems and solutions. Quantitative analysis revealed significant differences in SPD responsibilities and scope.
Discussion
Relationships with operating room staff were of paramount importance in the ability of the SPD to accomplish its job and in staff motivations and feelings. Differences in management practices, communication strategies, and problem-solving resources were also emphasized. Both quantitative and qualitative data showed concern for the role of the SPD in patient safety, particularly concerning practices such as the use of immediate-use steam sterilization.
Conclusions
To more completely address adverse patient events and surgical patient safety, we must move toward examining the entire surgical process, including the vital role of SPDs."

An intervention was designed to test whether the addition of an ultraviolet (UV) disinfection step after terminal cleaning would be helpful in reducing Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) rates in a real-world situation.
Methods
This study was a quasi-experimental design using 3 units as intervention units for the intervention and 3 similar units as control units. Intervention units 2 hematology and bone marrow transplant units and one medical-surgical unit at a large teaching hospital in the Midwest. UV disinfection was added after patient discharge and terminal cleaning in the intervention units.
Results
At baseline, CDI rates in the intervention and control arms were similar. During the 6 months of UV disinfection, the CDI rate in the intervention units decreased to 11.2 per 10,000 patient days, compared with 28.7 per 10,000 patient days in the control units (P = .03). In addition, the intervention units also saw a reduction in vancomycin-resistant enterococci acquisition.
Conclusions
The addition of UV disinfection to the terminal cleaning resulted in a reduction in CDI that has been sustained over several months 2 years."

Methods
Between July 2015 and February 2016, 13 carbapenem-resistant E. cloacae complex isolates were identified at our institution. Five blaKPC-positive isolates were identified by polymerase chain reaction and underwent pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and whole genome sequencing. Medical records of these patients were reviewed.
Results
All 5 case-isolates belonged to sequence type 171 and were blaKPC-3-positive. Three pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns with >90% similarity were identified in the 5 case-isolates. We identified overlaps in time and location between case patients. Plasmid types and resistance genes were nearly identical between the isolates. Whole genome sequencing showed isolates A, B, and D to be closely related with <10 core single-nucleotide polymorphisms differences. Isolates C and E were also closely related to each other, but more distantly to A, B, and D; all belonged to the clonal lineage of the major circulating E. cloacae complex strain in Minnesota and North Dakota. Despite having overlapping hospital stays, isolates for patients C and D were not identical.
Conclusions
Isolates A and D were nearly identical, indicating possible transmission during hospitalization. Transmission of the other isolates may have occurred elsewhere. This report highlights the importance of using both epidemiologic and molecular data to track the spread of carbapenemase-producers."

We assessed HH compliance from July-August 2016, using a modified WHO HH observation form. A 26-question survey was used to assess health care personnel (HCP) knowledge, opinions, and barriers to HH. A subgroup of HCPs participated in a 2-round focused survey to assign priority to the moments.
Results
Three hundred two HH opportunities were observed in 104 unique HCP-patient interactions. HH was performed at 106 (35%) opportunities, 37% (25 of 68) before touching a patient, 9% (6 of 70) before aseptic procedures, 5% (1 of 22) after body fluid exposure or risk, 63% (55 of 88) after touching a patient, and 35% (19 of 54) after touching patient surroundings. Two hundred eighteen HCPs completed the survey; 63 (29%) were familiar with the WHO 5 moments but only 13 (21%) were able to recall all 5 moments. In the focused surveys, 46% (6 of 13) ranked “before aseptic procedure” as the most important HH moment, and 86% (11 of 13) identified “after touching patient surroundings” as the least important.
Conclusions
We found frequent opportunities for HH with infrequent compliance. Lack of recognition of opportunities at the bedside and frequent glove use may contribute to lower compliance."

Clostridium difficile is the leading cause of health care–associated gastric illness. Environmental contamination with C difficile spores is a risk factor for contact transmission, and toilet flushing causes such contamination.

Methods
A flushometer toilet was seeded with C difficile spores in a sealed chamber. The toilet was flushed 24times, with postflush bowl water samples and settle plates periodically collected for culturing and counting. Air samples were collected after each of 12 flushes using rotating plate impactors.
Results
Spores were present in bowl water even after 24 flushes. Large droplet spore deposition accumulated over the 24-flush period. Droplet nuclei spore bioaerosol was produced over at least 12 flushes.
Conclusions
Toilets contaminated with C difficile spores are a persistent source of environmental contamination over an extended number of flushes."

This study aimed to estimate the impact of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA) on clinical and economic outcomes in a Chinese tertiary care hospital.
Methods
Patients were assigned to a carbapenem-susceptible P aeruginosa group or to a CRPA group and matched using propensity score matching. In-hospital mortality, length of stay (LOS), LOS after culture, total hospital costs, daily hospital cost, and 30-day readmission were comparatively analyzed. Subgroup analysis was performed to determine the associations between the subgrouping factors and in-hospital mortality in patients with CRPA isolates.
Results
Within the propensity-matched cohort, in-hospital mortality (12.6% vs 7.8%; P   =   .044), LOS (median 29.0 vs 25.5 days; P   =   .026), LOS after culture (median 18.5 vs 14.0 days; P   =   .029), total hospital costs (median $6,082.0 vs $4,954.2; P  =  .015), and daily hospital cost (median $236.1 vs $223.6; P  =  .045) were significantly higher in CRPA patients than in carbapenem-susceptible P aeruginosa patients. Subgroup analysis revealed a significant interaction between CRPA and age (P  =  .009).
Conclusion
Prevention and control of CRPA among hospitalized patients, especially among those over the age of 65 years, is a good measurement for the reduction of mortality and medical costs derived from CRPA infection or colonization."

Even though hand hygiene and aseptic techniques are essential to provide safe care in the operating room, several studies have found a lack of successful implementation. The aim of this study was to describe facilitative mechanisms supporting the implementation of hand hygiene and aseptic techniques.
Methods
This study was set in a large operating room suite in a Swedish university hospital. The theory-driven implementation process was informed by the literature on organizational change and dialogue. Data were collected using interviews and participant observations and analyzed using a thematic approach. The normalization process theory served as a frame of interpretation during the analysis.
Results
Three facilitating mechanisms were identified: (1) commitment through a sense of urgency, requiring extensive communication between the managers, operating room professionals, and facilitators in building commitment to change and putting the issues on the agenda; (2) dialogue for co-creation, increasing and sustaining commitment and resource mobilization; and (3) tailored management support, including helping managers to develop their leadership role, progressively involving staff, and retaining focus during the implementation process.
Conclusions
The facilitating mechanisms can be used in organizing implementation processes. Putting the emphasis on help and support to managers seems to be a crucial condition in complex implementation processes, from preparation of the change process to stabilization of the new practice."

A collaborative to control transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) was formed in Utah following a regional outbreak, with members from public health, hospitals, laboratories, and transport services. We conducted and qualitatively analyzed 3 focus groups among collaborative stakeholders to discuss their experiences.
Results
Via 3 focus groups and additional interviews, we found the collaborative made institutional tensions between stakeholders explicit. We identified 4 factors that facilitated the ability to overcome institutional tensions: public health leadership to establish a safe space, creation of cross-institutional group identity with mutual respect and support, standardized communication, and group cohesiveness through shared mental models of interdependencies.
Discussion
Stakeholders’ concerns regarding being blamed for MDRO transmission versus contributing to shared health care community MDRO control efforts resembled a “prisoner's dilemma.” Four social components mitigated tensions and facilitated cooperation in this public health–led collaborative.
Conclusions
This study identified strategies that public health-led coordinated approaches can use to facilitate cooperation."

In the United States, the laundry industry has not reliably measured microbial levels on hygienically clean textiles. The aim of this study was to quantitatively measure the microbial levels found on a sample of hygienically clean textiles.
Methods
Forty-eight health care textile samples were collected from hygienically clean linen scheduled to be used on 3 different patient care units. Samples were taken at 2 separate points in time representing laundry facility processing practices and hospital linen management practices. United States Pharmacopeia 61 testing was completed using a pour plate culturing method, producing a total aerobic microbial count and a total yeast and mold count.
Results
Of the samples, only 27% had a total aerobic microbial count below the expected 100 colony-forming unit level (range, 9-40,000) versus 81% (range, 9-1,000) for total yeast and mold count. Median microbial counts for the 2 separate time points across the 3 different patient care units were also higher than expected.
Conclusions
As far as we know, this study is a first step by the laundry industry to understand what quantitative microbial levels are currently found on hygienically clean health care textiles. These types of data can assist the industry in establishing appropriate outcome targets for process improvement initiatives."

abstract = "Objective
To describe an outbreak of influenza A in an oncology unit, highlighting infection control methods implemented, and examining reasons health care workers (HCWs) present to work with influenza-like illness (ILI).
Methods
Confirmed cases were defined by the presence of ILI and a positive nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction swab for influenza A H3. Probable cases were defined as exposed HCWs with ILI who were unavailable for polymerase chain reaction testing. Infection prevention measures included closing the ward for new admissions, oseltamivir prophylaxis for all exposed groups, and dismissal from work of HCWs with ILI until resolution of symptoms. An anonymous survey of the cases in our HCWs was conducted to better elucidate reasons behind presenteeism.
Results
Over the course of 8 days (November 16, 2017, to November 22, 2017), influenza was diagnosed in 7 of 10 inpatients on the oncology ward, 16 HCWs (14 confirmed, 2 probable), and 2 visitors. The suspected index case was an HCW. Of the surveyed HCWs, 64% presented to work despite feeling ill (ie, presenteeism). The most common reason was “sense of duty as a health care worker.”
Conclusions
This nosocomial outbreak of influenza highlights the challenges of protecting inpatients from viral respiratory tract infections. HCWs and patient visitors with ILI should avoid work or visiting until resolution of peak respiratory symptoms and adhere to strict respiratory etiquette."

Anesthesia providers commonly cross-contaminate their workspace and subsequently put patients at risk for a health care–acquired infection. The primary objective of this project was to determine if education and implementation of standardized infection control guidelines that address evidence-based best practices would improve compliance with infection control procedures in the anesthesia workspace.
Methods
Patient care–related hand hygiene of nurse anesthetists was observed in 3 areas of anesthesia practice before and 3 weeks and 3 months after staff education, placement of visual reminders, and the implementation of infection control guidelines. After the observation periods, the percent compliance on the part of the providers was calculated for each of the 3 areas of anesthesia practice, and the results were compared using the Fisher exact test.
Results
There were a total of 95 observations performed during the 3 observation periods. When compared with preimplementation baseline data, there was a 26.2% increase in the number of providers compliant with hand hygiene practices after airway instrumentation (P = .029) and a 71.9% increase in the number of providers who separated clean from contaminated items in the workspace (P = .0001).

Methods
Systematic review was performed using the protocol of the Joanna Briggs Institute, including clinical trials and observational comparative studies. Search was conducted via PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, LILACS, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest, Google Scholar, and gray literature. To evaluate outcomes, 3 independent reviews were conducted: HAI rates, presence of resistance genes or higher minimum inhibitory or bactericidal concentration, and damage to skin integrity.
Results
Studies showed no significant difference in HAI rates when using CHG for HH. Among 13 studies, 10 suggested an association with use of and tolerance to CHG. The use of CHG was associated with skin reaction events.
Conclusions
Strong evidence regarding the risks and benefits of CHG for HH is still lacking. Due to potential risk of selecting mutants carrying genes for cross-resistance to CHG and antibiotics, it is advisable to reserve the use of CHG for purposes other than HH."

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) remains a frequent and severe complication in mechanically ventilated patients. We undertook a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of chest physiotherapy (CPT) for the prevention of VAP.
Methods
A systematic literature search of PubMed and Embase databases were searched up until November 25, 2018 for published studies of mechanically ventilated patients comparing CPT with controls and reporting on the occurrence of VAP. Two authors independently selected studies and abstracted data on study quality and outcomes. We pooled data using random-effects models.
Results
A total of 6 randomized (n = 704) controlled trials were identified. CPT did not significantly reduce the incidence of VAP (risk ratio = 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.82-1.26; P = .87), but reduced hospital mortality (risk ratio = 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.95; P = .02). No significant differences were observed regarding intensive care unit mortality, length of intensive care unit stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation.
Conclusions
CPT may not significantly reduce the incidence of VAP and alter other important clinical outcomes in adult patients receiving mechanical ventilation. However, the results should be interpreted cautiously owing to the heterogeneity and the limited trials. Further large-scale, well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed."

Health care workers routinely contaminate skin and clothing when doffing personal protective equipment (PPE). Alternative doffing strategies, such as hand hygiene on gloved hands and double gloving, have been suggested but not validated by comparison against the standard Centers for Disease Control and Prevention procedures.
Methods
Participants were assigned to doff PPE following 1 of 4 specific strategies. Prior to doffing, PPE was “contaminated” with Glo Germ and fluorescing Staphylococcus epidermidis at the recommended level of 1.5 × 108 colony forming units/mL. After doffing, areas of self-contamination were detected using a black light. Cultures were taken from these areas using cotton swabs, inoculated onto blood agar plates, and incubated for 48hours. Each participant completed a survey regarding usability. The Fisher exact test and the Kruskal-Wallis test were used for data analysis with SAS 9.4.
Results
There were 51 participants who completed the study. Breaches in PPE were observed in only 5 of 51 doffs (10%). However, 46 of 51 (90%) had areas of self-contamination that was apparent by transfer of Glo Germ to skin or clothing. A subset (16%) of these sites also grew fluorescing S epidermidis. Assigned doffing strategy was associated with bacterial contamination (P = .0151), but not usability (P = .2372).
Conclusions
Participants experienced self-contamination when doffing PPE with both a surrogate marker and live bacteria. Close attention to doffing technique is necessary for optimal results, and one-step procedures may be more effective."

The purpose of this study was to understand how IPs perceived their challenges and how these challenges negatively affect their infection prevention work in psychiatric clinical settings.
Methods
A descriptive, qualitative research approach was used in this study. Thirteen Taiwanese psychiatric IPs were interviewed in semistructured interviews. Data were transcribed and then analyzed by thematic analysis.
Results
This analysis identified 6 themes: (1) lack of preservice training in psychiatric infection control, (2) insufficient staffing in practice, (3) working within environmental limits, (4) patient noncompliance, (5) undervaluation of the importance of infection control by professionals, and (6) involvement of hospital administrators.
Conclusions
The implementation of effective infection prevention in psychiatric clinical settings may be strongly related to the factors of sufficient training and IP staffing while relying on collaboration among patients and clinical professionals and on the full support of administrators."

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is among the most common health care–associated infections in the United States and is increasingly affecting the elderly. Although carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infections are still relatively uncommon, there are reported increases in the rate of infection for certain strains, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae. This study examines the burden of mortality and morbidity for CDI and CRE infections in the United States and estimates the societal willingness to pay to avoid them.
Methods
We use an analytic model to estimate the number of incident cases and associated health outcomes for CDI and CRE infections.
Results
The number of CDI and CRE infection incident cases in the United States in 2016, is estimated at 468,567 and 9,620, respectively. These infections result in a total of 17,630 estimated deaths and 8,624 lost quality-adjusted life years among patients who survive per year.
Conclusions
Given the significant mortality and morbidity from these infections, the estimated societal willingness to pay to avoid them is high at $176.7 billion per year, of which 93.9% ($166.0 billion) is for CDI. Our estimates far exceed the medical care costs for CDIs and CRE infections reported in the literature despite not capturing the additional costs borne by third-party payers. As incident cases increase or resistant strains develop, the societal willingness to pay is also expected to increase."

Inclusion of reusable respirators, such as elastomeric half-face respirators (EHFRs) and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs), in hospital respiratory protection inventories may represent 1 solution to the problem of N95 respirator shortages experienced during pandemics. User acceptance of these devices is 1 potential barrier to implementing such a strategy in respiratory protection programs.
Methods
To assess user attitudes toward various respirators, health care workers enrolled in respiratory protection programs in a medical system using EHFRs, N95s, and PAPRs and completed an online questionnaire that addressed attitudes, beliefs, and respirator preferences under different risk scenarios. Responses were compared between user groups.
Results
Of 1,152 participants, 53% currently used N95s, 24% used EHFRs, and 23% used PAPRs. N95 users rated their respirators more favorably compared with EHFR and PAPR users (P < .001) regarding comfort and communication, however, EHFR users rated their respirators much more highly regarding sense of protection (P < .001). For all user groups, reusable respirators were significantly more likely (odds ratios 2.3-7.7) to be preferred over N95 filtering facepiece respirators in higher risk scenarios compared to “usual circumstance” scenarios.
Conclusions
Despite somewhat less favorable ratings on comfort and communication, experienced EHFR and PAPR users still prefer reusable respirators over N95s in certain higher risk scenarios. This suggests that reusable respirators are an acceptable alternative to N95 respirators in health care and offer 1 viable solution to prevent pandemic-generated respirator shortages."

Healthcare–associated Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) can result from organisms found on hospital environmental surfaces. Without proper cleaning of hospital environmental surfaces, cross-contamination can occur, resulting in a healthcare–associated infection. In 2011, an environmental services (EVS) model was developed in Hospital A that resulted in a reduction in healthcare–associated CDI. The purpose of this study was to determine if implementing Hospital A's EVS model in Hospital B would decrease healthcare–associated CDI incidence.
Methods
A quasi-experimental design was used. The study was conducted in Hospital B, a 53-bed acute care community-based hospital, between January 2013 and December 2017. A retrospective review of all CDI LabID A/B toxin enzyme immunoassay events was performed using the National Healthcare Safety Network surveillance definitions. The data were calculated based on incidence rates per 1,000 patient days and the National Healthcare Safety Network standard infection ratio formula. No new disinfectants, antibiotic restrictions, or new isolation techniques were instituted during this time period.
Results
There was a 100% reduction in healthcare–associated CDI in Hospital B from 2013’s baseline rate of 0.48 per 1,000 patient days to 0.00 per 1,000 patient days (0.48, 0.00, P = 0.020).

Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) requires that patients and their caregivers administer antimicrobial medications in the home via venous catheters. Hazards from physical attributes of the home environment may impede safe performance of OPAT tasks.
Methods
We performed a qualitative study, including semistructured telephone interviews and contextual inquiries, of patients performing OPAT tasks inside the home. Eligible participants were discharged from 2 academic medical centers in Baltimore, Maryland, on OPAT. We coded interview transcripts and contextual inquiry forms based on a model of healthcare work systems.
Results
Twenty-nine patients underwent semistructured telephone interviews, and 14 patients underwent contextual inquiry. We identified hazards including bathing, animal or pets, extremes in temperature, household clutter, indoor soil and food exposures, outdoor soil, and travel. Patients often developed strategies to mitigate these hazards.
Discussion
Multiple hazards related to the home environment could have led to harm, and in the absence of specific guidance, patients developed strategies to mitigate these hazards.
Conclusions
Educational interventions to improve OPAT should incorporate an understanding of hazards that may occur in the home environment."

We summarize insights from these activities to highlight feasibility and benefits of stakeholder engagement in health care epidemiology research.Patients and caregivers who had an HAI experience were involved in a patient and caregiver stakeholder group. We engaged clinicians, infection prevention experts, state public health professionals, and quality improvement experts in an institutional stakeholder (IS) group in an academic tertiary care medical center.
Methods
Through individual and combined group activities, we identified stakeholders’ HAI research priorities. Existing engagement resources from the Wisconsin Network for Research Support (WINRS) guided the process.
Results
Given the patients’ and caregivers’ experiences with HAIs, their perspectives broadened IS understanding of the impact of HAIs and the relevance of proposed research topics. After introductory activities described here, the patient and caregiver stakeholder group actively engaged with researchers and the IS group in discussing complex systems-level topics to reduce HAIs. We have sustained this engagement through continued collaboration.
Conclusions
Our engagement experience provides one example of how patients can be engaged in health care epidemiology research. Our experiences and lessons learned may be helpful to others interested in stakeholder engagement."

In January 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new surveillance definitions for ventilator-associated event (VAE) to replace ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in adult patients. VAEs are associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation and hospital death, but little is known about their risk factors and how best to prevent them.
Methods
We compared VAE cases with non-VAE cases with regard to demographics, comorbidities, sedative exposures, opioids exposures, paralytic exposures, routes of nutrition, blood products, gastric retention, and fluid balance. Patients mechanically ventilated for ≥4 days between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2017, in 2 adult intensive care units of a tertiary care teaching hospital in China were included.
Results
On multivariable logistic regression, significant risk factors for VAEs were positive daily fluid balances of ≥ 50 mL between day of intubation and the fourth day of mechanical ventilation (relative risk [RR], 8.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.99-23.50), sedative administered between the first day and the fourth day of invasive mechanical ventilation (RR, 15.69; 95% CI, 1.62-152.06), and daily gastric retention of ≥200 mL between day of intubation and the fourth day of mechanical ventilation (RR, 9.27; 95% CI, 1.89-45.47).
Conclusions
Positive daily fluid balances of ≥50 mL, sedatives administered, and gastric retention of ≥200 mL are risk factors for VAEs. Intervention studies are needed to determine if targeting these risk factors can lower VAE rates."

Meta-analysis of the incidence rate based on the best outcome measure resulted in 13.2 injuries per 100 time-units (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.7-37.1; I2 = 100%). Per 100 person-years, the injury rate was 88.2 (95% CI, 61.3-126.9; 21 studies) for self-reported injuries, 40.0 for perforations (95% CI, 19.2-83.5; 15 studies), and 5.8 for administrative injuries (95% CI, 2.7-12.2; 5 studies). Per 100 po, the respective figures were 2.1 (95% CI, 0.8-5.0; 4 studies), 11.1 (95% CI, 6.6-18.9, 15 studies), and 0.1 (95% CI, 0.05-0.21). I2 values were all above 90%. Meta-regression indicated lower incidence rates in studies that used perforations per po.
Conclusions
A surgeon will have a sharps injury in about 1 in 10 operations . Reporting of sharps injuries in surgical staff should be standardized per 100 po and be assessed in prospective follow-up studies."

abstract = "Background
Hospital-acquired Legionnaires’ disease is associated with the presence of Legionella pneumophila in hospital water systems. In the United Kingdom, the Department of Health recommends maintaining hot water temperatures >55°C and cold water temperatures <20°C at the point of delivery to prevent proliferation of L pneumophila in water systems. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of copper and silver ionization to control L pneumophila at deliberately reduced hot water temperatures (43°C) within a newly installed water system in a new building linked to a large health care facility in the United Kingdom.
Methods
One thousand, five hundred ninety-eight water samples were collected between September 2011 and June 2017. Samples were tested using accredited methods for L pneumophila, copper and silver ion levels, and total viable counts. Energy consumption and water usage data were also collected to permit carbon emission calculations.
Results
The results of 1,598 routine samples from September 2011 to June 2017, and the recordings of temperatures at outlets in this facility, demonstrated effective (100%) L pneumophila control throughout the study period with an average hot water temperature of 42°C. The energy savings and reduction of carbon emissions were calculated to amount to 33% and 24%, respectively, compared to an equivalent temperature-controlled system. Water system management interventions were required to achieve consistently adequate levels of copper and silver across outlets.
Conclusions
This study demonstrated that it is possible to control L pneumophila independent of temperature when copper and silver ionization is introduced into a new building in conjunction with an appropriately managed water system."

Compliance with hand hygiene guidelines reduces the risk of health care–associated infection, yet doctors are less compliant than other health care workers. Use of observational hand hygiene auditing with targeted individualized feedback was implemented, with improved hand hygiene of consultant doctors; however, the factors that influenced this were not explained by previous quantitative data. The aim was to explore consultant doctors’ opinions about the influence of observational hand hygiene auditing with individualized feedback on hand hygiene behavior.
Methods
Using the Theoretical Domains Framework, we conducted 12 semi-structured in-depth interviews with consultant doctors who experienced the observational hand hygiene audit and feedback intervention. Data were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach.
Results
Analysis identified 8 domains of the Theoretical Domains Framework, with 5 dominant domains: (1) behavioral regulation: receiving written individualized audit feedback positively influenced practice; (2) knowledge: provision of specific individualized feedback improved performance; (3) reinforcement: audit highlighted substandard practices; (4) social professional role and identity: audit reports triggered profession-associated competitive motivation; and (5) environmental context and resources: auditing was perceived to be synonymous with strong organizational safety culture.
Conclusions
In this study, provision of individualized targeted feedback was a critical component of observational hand hygiene auditing."

Twenty-six healthy women aged 65-90 years participated in this study and received disposable and towel baths. We measured 4 indicators before and after bathing. The participants’ relaxation levels were measured by the Japanese adult version of the Profile of Mood States Second Edition short form.
Results
Both disposable and towel baths significantly decreased resident skin bacteria. Disposable bath also significantly reduced Staphylococcus aureus and effectively maintained the water content of the stratum corneum. Furthermore, disposable bath was as effective as towel bath at contributing to participants’ relaxation levels.

Results
Overall HHC was 91.0% for OO, and 49.3% for CO. HHC in phase 1 was not changed by repeated CO (34.7% and 34.0%, P = .70). HHC based on CO increased to 66.9% in phase 2 after the application of an intervention (P < .01), but decreased to 57.5% in phase 3 (P < .01).

Patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) have a high risk for multidrug-resistant organisms, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). Accurate and easily applied definitions are critical to identify CRE. This study describes CRE and associated characteristics in veterans with SCI per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) definitions.
Methods
A retrospective cohort of veterans with SCI and more than 1 culture with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp and/or Enterobacter spp between 2012 and 2013 was examined. Antibiotic susceptibility criteria of pre-2015 (CDC1) and post-2015 (CDC2) CDC definitions and pre-2017 (VA1) and post-2017 (VA2) VA definitions were used to identify CRE. CRE prevalence and characteristics are described for isolates meeting each definition, and agreement was assessed with the Cohen kappa.
Results
We reviewed 21,514 isolates cultured from 6,974 veterans; 423 isolates met any CRE definition. Although agreement among definitions was high (kappa = 0.82-0.93), definitions including ertapenem resistance led to higher CRE prevalence (VA1 = 1.7% and CDC2 = 1.9% vs VA2 = 1.4% and CDC1 = 1.5%). Forty-four of 142 VA facilities had more than 1 CRE case defined by VA2; 10 facilities accounted for 60% of CRE cases. Almost all CRE was isolated from high-complexity, urban facilities, and the South had the highest proportion of CRE.
Conclusions
Varying federal definitions give different CRE frequencies in a high-risk population. Definitions including ertapenem resistance resulted in higher CRE prevalence but may overemphasize noncarbapenemase isolates. Thus, both federal definitions now highlight the importance of carbapenemase testing."

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is among the most important opportunistic pathogens in HIV+ patients, resulting in considerable morbidity and mortality.
Methods
The MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases were comprehensively searched for studies that investigated the prevalence of MRSA colonization in HIV+ patients. We used a random effects model to calculate pooled prevalence estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and analyzed data based on World Health Organization regions.
Results
Among 9,772 records identified, 69 were included in the meta-analysis, comprising 30,050 HIV+ patients from 21 countries. We estimated the pooled worldwide prevalence of MRSA in people living with HIV to be 7% (95% CI 5%-9%, 1,623/30,050), with the highest prevalence in Southeast Asia (16%, 95% CI 9%-24%) and the region of the Americas (10%; 95% CI 7%-13%) and lowest prevalence in the European region (1%; 95% CI 0%-1%). Globally, we estimated approximately 2,659,000 (95% CI 1,835,000-3,303,000) HIV+ patients with colonized MRSA. Potential risk factors for MRSA colonization in HIV+ patients included previous MRSA infection (OR, 7.5; 95% CI, 3.91-14.37), hospitalization in the past year (OR, 1.87; 95% CI 1.11-3.16), and use of antibiotics (OR, 2.52; 95% CI 1.39-4.58).

Airflow distribution in the operating room plays an important role in ensuring a clean operating microenvironment and preventing surgical site infections (SSIs) caused by airborne contaminations. The objective of this study was to characterize the airflow distribution in proximity to a patient in an orthopedic operating room.
Methods
Experimental measurements were conducted in a real operating room at St. Olav's Hospital, Norway, with a laminar airflow system. Omnidirectional anemometers were used to investigate the air distribution in the operating zone, and 4 different cases were examined with a real person and a thermal manikin.
Results
This study showed that the downward airflow from the laminar airflow system varies in each case with different surgical arrangement, such as the position of the operating lamp. The results indicate that the interaction of thermal plumes from a patient and the downward laminar airflow may dominate the operating microenvironment.
Conclusions
The airflow distribution in proximity to a patient is influenced by both the surgical facility and the presence of medical staff. A thermal manikin may be an economical and practical way to study the interaction of thermal plumes and downward laminar airflow. The provision of higher clean airflow rate in the operating microenvironment may be an effective way to prevent the development of SSIs caused by indoor airborne contamination."

Many studies investigating daily chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) bathing as an infection control intervention to decrease health care–associated infections have focused on reduction of infection and colonization; few studies have assessed CHG bathing compliance, work system factors, facilitators, and barriers to implementation.
Methods
This is a combination retrospective/prospective pilot study conducted at a large academic teaching hospital that implemented daily CHG bathing across all inpatient units. CHG compliance and patient refusal were calculated on the basis of documentation in the electronic medical record. We used the health belief model to guide semistructured interviews with patients about knowledge and barriers related to CHG bathing.
Results
Of the 31 patients interviewed, 74% reported using CHG soap during their stay. Average compliance documented in the electronic medical record was 78% with a range of 57%-91% among all hospital units. Sixteen percent of patients declined CHG bathing, and refusal ranged from 3%-29% among all units. Major themes about CHG bathing from patient interviews include low perceived susceptibility to infection, high degree of trust in medical professionals, low knowledge of benefits of CHG, and low perceived self-efficacy in preventing HAIs.
Conclusions
Educating patients about CHG bathing appears to be a critical factor in decreasing patient refusal of CHG bathing."

In the postacute and long-term care setting, the practice of changing the indwelling urinary catheter large sterile drainage bag to a small-size leg drainage bag is intended to maintain a person's mobility, dignity, and comfort. There is scant evidence that assesses the impact of intermittent use of a leg bag on frequency of urinary tract infection since this breaks the closed urinary drainage system.
Methods
We reviewed research published between 1993 and 2014 for the answers to 20 practice questions developed by experts and long-term care clinicians on the risks and benefits, cleaning, connection, and storage of reusable leg bags.
Results
Seventeen of the 26 publications and studies provided varying advice on the risk of breaking the closed system and on practices for changing, disinfecting, and storing leg bags between uses. Thirteen of 20 practice questions were answered by ≥1 publications, few of which were evidence based.
Conclusions
We identified the existence of low-level evidence that leg bags pose no evident, disproportionate risk of infection compared with maintaining a closed system. The lack of uniformity in evidence in the literature suggests aseptic technique should guide practice. Available evidence suggests that aseptic technique should guide practice."

Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the complications posed by knee replacement surgery. Hospital-based infection surveillance systems may provide indicators of improvement and allow the characterization of risk factors critical to reduce infection. The aims of this study were to compare the incidence of SSI in our center with rates in the Madrid Region, Spain, and the United States, and to evaluate any possible SSI-related risk factor in knee replacement surgery.
Methods
All patients who underwent knee replacement surgery at a tertiary hospital in 2008–2016 were included. SSI was defined according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria. Infection rate was calculated. The association between risk factors and SSI incidence was assessed by reference to odds ratio (OR) with multivariate analysis.
Results
The study population (n = 1969) had a global SSI risk of 1.0%. We found a declining trend in the follow-up period, from an SSI risk of 1.8% in 2009 to 0.4% in 2016.

Nurses represent an underused workforce for performing antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) activities. Before engaging nurses in these activities, barriers and facilitators to the targeted behavior change should be identified using a validated model.
Methods
This was a prospective, qualitative, descriptive study to determine the barriers and facilitators to the promotion of intravenous (IV) to oral (PO) antimicrobials by nurses. Semi-structured 1-on-1 interviews of nurses were conducted from January-February 2017. Interviews were analyzed for themes within the domains of the theoretical domains framework (TDF) by directed-content analysis.
Results
Evaluation of the 14 TDF domains revealed 9 modifiable barriers to nurse promotion of IV to PO step-down, including insufficient knowledge, lack of prescriber cooperation, lack of self-confidence, and low priority activity. Nine facilitators that could enhance nurse promotion of step-down were identified, including capability to assess patients for step-down, ability to communicate assessment results to the team, and preexistence of a variety of resources available for nurse education and training. Nurses perceived that increased step-down rates would increase nursing efficiency.
Conclusions
Nurses have the potential to improve AMS through promotion of IV to PO step-down of antimicrobials. Themes pertaining to barriers and facilitators of nurses' participation in IV to PO step-down of antimicrobials were identified."

Infection Preventionists have varying levels of educational preparation. Many have no prior experience in IP. The diversity makes design of professional development programs challenging. Recent surveys suggest that only about half of practicing IPs are board certified. There is an urgent need to employ competent IP’s to drive improvement in patient outcomes.
Methods
This is a project that utilized the APIC Competency Model to create a professional development program characterizing three career stages. Methods included a review of literature on professional development; a survey of IP competence; an assessment of job descriptions and performance evaluations; and a crosswalk of IP competencies.
Results
The professional development program includes competency - based IP job descriptions and performance evaluations for each career stage; a professional portfolio; and a toolkit for supervisors.
Discussion
Participants agreed that application of the model resulted in tools which are more closely aligned with current roles for IPs; and increased satisfaction and motivation with the new program.
Conclusion
Competent and knowledgeable IP's are crucial to optimizing efficacy of IPC programs. A professional development program has the potential to guide staff orientation, improve satisfaction and retention, improve patient outcomes and promote a positive trajectory in advancing practice."

As a communications strategy, education entertainment has been used to inform, influence, and shift societal and individual behaviors. Recently, there has been an increasing number of entertainment-education YouTube videos focused on hand hygiene. However, there is currently no understanding about the quality of these videos; therefore, this study aimed to explore the social media content and user engagement with these videos.
Methods
The search terms “hand hygiene” and “hand hygiene education” were used to query YouTube. Video content had to be directed at a health care professional audience. Using author designed checklists, each video was systematically evaluated and grouped according to educational usefulness and was subsequently evaluated against the categories of attractiveness, comprehension, and persuasiveness.
Results
A total of 400 videos were screened, with 70 videos retained for analysis. Of these, 55.7% (n = 39) were categorized as educationally useful. Overall, educationally useful videos scored higher than noneducationally useful videos across the categories of attractiveness, comprehension, and persuasiveness. Miscommunication of the concept of My 5 Moments for Hand Hygiene was observed in several of the YouTube videos.
Conclusions
The availability of educationally useful videos in relation to hand hygiene is evident; however, it is clear that there are opportunities for contributors using this medium to strengthen their alignment with social media best practice principles to maximize the effectiveness, reach, and sustainability of their content."

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Computerized clinical decision support (CCDS) tools can aid process improvement in infection prevention and antibiotic stewardship, but implementation and health care workers (HCWs) uptake of these tools is often variable. The objective of this study was to describe HCWs' perceptions of barriers and facilitators related to uptake of CCDS tools as part of a CDI reduction bundle.
Methods
We conducted a qualitative study among HCWs at 2 acute care hospitals in Maryland. Semi-structured interviews and structured surveys were completed by HCWs to evaluate their perception to CCDS tools at 2 different stages: predevelopment and preimplementation. Emergent themes and patterns in the data were identified and condensed.
Results
Gaps in CDI-related knowledge and in communication between HCWs were identified throughout the evaluation. HCWs agreed on the potential of the tools to improve CDI diagnosis, prevention, and control. An important barrier for uptake was the perceived loss of autonomy and clinical judgment, whereas standardization and error reduction were perceived advantages.
Conclusions
These observations shaped the development and implementation of the CDI reduction bundle. Qualitative findings can provide valuable contextual information during the development stages of CCDS tools in infection prevention and antibiotic stewardship."

Surgical site infections (SSIs) increase morbidity and mortality after primary hip and knee arthroplasty. We evaluated a surveillance program that tracked risk factors associated with infection after primary hip and knee arthroplasty in the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority.
Methods
Surveillance data from April 2010 to March 2015 were reviewed for all 12,636 primary hip or knee arthroplasties, including 1-year follow-up. Procedures were evaluated in earlier (April 2010 to December 2012) and later periods (January 2013 to March 2015). Risk factors for postoperative infection were evaluated.
Results
There were 154 SSIs in 12,636 operations (1.22%) (earlier, 98 infections in 6,613 operations [1.48%]; later, 56 infections in 6,023 operations [0.93%]). The frequency of primary hip arthroplasty deep infection decreased from earlier to later periods; the frequency of primary knee arthroplasty infection was similar between the time periods. Independent risk factors associated with increased SSI risk included higher body mass index. SSI frequency was inversely associated with maintaining immediate postoperative temperature between 36°C and 38°C and surgery in the later period.
Conclusions
Surveillance was effective in decreasing the frequency of deep infection after primary total hip arthroplasties but not after knee arthroplasties. Surveillance of orthopedic surgery with feedback of SSI rates to the front-line staff may result in improvement in surgical outcomes."

Antimicrobial-impregnated (AIP) peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) may lower risk of central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) compared with nonantimicrobial-impregnated (NAIP) catheters. We sought to assess risk factors for CLABSI with a focus on the effect of AIP PICCs.
Methods
CLABSI rate was determined among patients who received PICCs from July 2009 through June 2012 using a retrospective study design. A nested case-control study matched for operators (interventional radiology [IR], infectious diseases [IDs], and the nurse venous access team [VAT]) was conducted to assess risks for PICC CLABSI.
Results
Eighty-nine PICC CLABSIs (1.66%) occurred among 5,372 PICC placements a mean of 32 days after placement. Higher infection risk (1.75) was observed for IR-placed PICCs compared with ID-placed PICCs (P = .02). In addition, higher infection risk (4.22) was observed for IR-placed PICCS compared with VAT-placed PICCs (P = .0008). IR-placed NAIP catheters, as indicated by multivariate analysis, revealed a 5.45-fold greater CLABSI risk compared with AIP catheters (P < .0005). Other risk factors included chemotherapy, placement of a tunneled catheter, leukemia, and AIDS.
Conclusions
PICC CLABSIs were highest among patients receiving NAIP catheters in this large study. Highest risk occurred with placement of a tunneled catheter, AIDS, leukemia, and if the indication for PICC was chemotherapy. Our study suggests that the AIP PICC should be considered in all patients receiving PICCs."

Few published data are available on the morbidity and mortality of bloodstream infections (BSIs) in Japan. We sought to investigate the epidemiology of BSIs, the involvement of antimicrobial resistance, and the factors that influence patient prognosis.
Methods
This single-center study retrospectively evaluated patients who were found to have positive blood cultures at a tertiary teaching hospital between January 2012 and December 2016.
Results
A total of 2,105 patients with BSIs were included; 1,786 survived and 319 died, and the 30-day mortality rate was 15.2% over the 5-year study period. BSIs caused by yeasts were independently associated with 30-day mortality. The 30-day mortality rate of BSIs caused by extended-spectrum beta lactamase–producing gram-negative bacteria was significantly higher than that of BSIs caused by nonproducing bacteria.
Discussion
The differences in mortality may be caused by differences in the distribution of pathogens and in the delivery of health care.
Conclusions
This study reported epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance data of BSIs in Japan and identified several risk factors associated with 30-day mortality. National surveillance of BSIs is required in Japan for comparison with other countries."

Disinfectant towelettes are commonly used for surface disinfection to prevent health care–associated infections; however, there is limited consensus as to whether a surface needs to remain wet for the full label contact time after the disinfectant towelette has been used in order for complete efficacy to be achieved. The purpose of this study was to quantify the effect of contact time, including times before and after a product dries, on bactericidal efficacy of 6 towelette products registered by the Environmental Protection Agency .
Methods
Six disinfectant towelette products were tested at varying contact times, including defined label contact times. Quantitative Environmental Protection Agency MB-33-00 was used to measure disinfectant efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus on Formica. Complete dry time for each disinfectant was measured gravimetrically.
Results
There were significant differences in dry times among the towelette products; contact time did not have a significant effect on bactericidal efficacy. There was no longitudinal effect when a disinfectant's contact time was greater than defined label contact time, irrespective of whether the product was wet or dry on the surface.
Discussion
Overall, bactericidal efficacy varied by towelette product tested and surface area wiped. Wiping larger surface areas may lead to decreased bactericidal efficacy but is product dependent.
Conclusions
There was no additional bactericidal effect after a product dried, indicating that extended contact times beyond when the product dries will not enhance disinfection."

In this first attempt to suggest achievable standards for improvement in hospital infection prevention and control (IPC) in Greece, we assessed main IPC structure and process indicators emphasizing hand hygiene.
Methods
Acute-care hospitals across the country participated in a cross-sectional survey by completing the World Health Organization Hand Hygiene Self-assessment Framework (HHSAF) and by providing hospital-level IPC indicators.
Results
Seventeen hospitals completed the survey, comprising 14% of the country's public hospitals. Median IPC staffing levels were 0.8 nurses and 0.5 doctors per 250 beds. Few hospitals implemented full multimodal IPC programs. The HHSAF indicated that appropriate hand hygiene practices and promotion strategies were in place in most hospitals, but the mean HHSAF score of 289 was lower compared with studies in Italy (mean, 332; P = .040) and the United States (mean, 373; P < .001). Presence of 1 additional IPC nurse was independently associated with increases of 53% in the HHSAF median score for training-education (P = .035) and by 38% in the lower 30th percentile HHSAF score for safety climate (P = .049).
Conclusions
Surveyed hospitals are, on average, at an intermediate level in hand hygiene practice but require improvements on training-education, evaluation-feedback, and safety climate. Ensuring adequate IPC nurse staffing levels and systematically implementing multimodal IPC programs may lead to substantial improvements."

Reusable electroencephalography cup electrodes and lead wires (rEEGs-CELWs) could be a source of microorganisms capable of causing hospital-acquired infections. The purpose of this study was to investigate for bacterial species of cleaned rEEGs-CELWs.
Methods
This microbiologic evaluation involved 4 epilepsy monitoring units where rEEGs-CELWs were swabbed for bacteria using standard techniques. Analyses involved descriptive statistics and logistic regression (across sites).
Results
Of 124 swabs, 31 (25.0%; range, 13.3%-43.3%) showed positive bacterial cultures, without between-site differences (P = .17). Bacteria were labeled by risk for hospital-acquired infection: no risk, potential risk (primarily in immunocompromised patients), and at risk (associated with infections and antibiotic resistance). At-risk bacteria species were Staphylococcus epidermidis (38.7%), Staphylococcus capitis subsp ureolyticus (3.2%), and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (9.6%). Potential-risk species were Micrococcus spp (22.6%), Acinetobacter lwoffii (6.5%), Staphylococcus hominis subsp hominis (6.5%), and Staphylococcus warneri (6.5%). Bacillus (9.6%) was the only no-risk species. Of 18 antibiotics tested on positive cultures, resistant bacteria were found in a median of 1 (range, 0-11) positive culture, equating to a 6.7% (range, 0%-61.1%) resistant antibiotic rate; no microorganisms were resistant to all antibiotics tested.
Conclusions
Bacteria that were potential risk or at risk for infection were found on 22.6% of cleaned rEEGs-CELWs. Use of single-use electrodes and research on scalp infection and infection reduction interventions are warranted."

Health care workers (HCWs) are significant vectors for transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms among patients in intensive care units (ICUs). We studied ICU patients on contact precautions, colonized with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), to assess whether bacterial burden is associated with transmission to HCWs’ gloves or gowns, a surrogate outcome for transmission to subsequent patients.
Methods
From this prospective cohort study, we analyzed 96 VRE-colonized ICU patients and 5 HCWs per patient. We obtained samples from patients’ perianal area, skin, and stool to assess bacterial burden and cultured HCWs’ gloves and gowns for VRE after patient care.
Results
Seventy-one of 479 (15%) HCW-patient interactions led to contamination of HCWs’ gloves or gowns with VRE. HCW contamination was associated with VRE burden on the perianal swab (odds ratio [OR], 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19, 1.57), skin swabs (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.51, 3.02), and in stool (OR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.39, 2.72). Compared with colonization with Enterococcus faecalis, colonization with Enterococcus faecium was associated with higher bacterial burden and higher odds of transmission to HCWs.
Conclusions
We show that ICU patients with higher bacterial burden are more likely to transmit VRE to HCWs. These findings have implications for VRE decolonization and other infection control interventions."

Healthcare workers perform hand hygiene much more frequently than workers in other fields. As a result, healthcare workers have a higher exposure to topical antiseptic products.
Methods
Five tertiary care facilities were equipped with an electronic hand hygiene compliance monitoring system. Alcohol-based handrub (ABHR) and handwash use was recorded on a worker-specific basis for 6 months. Total hand hygiene product use and total hours worked were calculated for each worker to determine use frequency.
Results
A detailed, descriptive analysis of hand hygiene practices was performed. All facilities demonstrated high hand hygiene compliance rates (>85%). ABHR use was more frequent (9.1 uses/hour, 95th percentile) than handwashing (2.1 uses/hour, 95th percentile). This study identified a relationship between hand hygiene frequency and job function. Nursing and nonclinical support staff demonstrated higher usage rates than other healthcare workers. For these workers with high hand hygiene frequency, 95th percentile usage rates for ABHR use and handwashing were 9.6 and 2.2 uses/hour, respectively.
Conclusions
This extensive dataset, monitoring nearly 4000 healthcare workers and more than 6 million data points, provides a detailed description of current hand hygiene practices of hospital staff. ABHR was used more frequently than handwashing. Job function was found to affect hand hygiene frequency, with nonclinical staff and nursing staff demonstrating elevated rates of hand hygiene."

The mandatory national hand hygiene program requires Australian public hospitals to use direct human auditing to establish compliance rates. To establish the magnitude of the Hawthorne effect, we compared direct human audit rates with concurrent automated surveillance rates.
Methods
A large tertiary Australian teaching hospital previously trialed automated surveillance while simultaneously performing mandatory human audits for 20 minutes daily on a medical and a surgical ward. Subtracting automated surveillance rates from human audit rates provided differences in percentage points (PPs) for each of the 3 quarterly reporting periods for 2014 and 2015.
Results
Direct human audit rates for the medical ward were inflated by an average of 55 PPs in 2014 and 64 PPs in 2015, 2.8-3.1 times higher than automated surveillance rates. The rates for the surgical ward were inflated by an average of 32 PPs in 2014 and 31 PPs in 2015, 1.6 times higher than automated surveillance rates. Over the 6 mandatory reporting quarters, human audits collected an average of 255 opportunities, whereas automation collected 578 times more data, averaging 147,308 opportunities per quarter. The magnitude of the Hawthorne effect on direct human auditing was not trivial and produced highly inflated compliance rates.
Conclusions
Mandatory compliance necessitates accuracy that only automated surveillance can achieve, whereas daily hand hygiene ambassadors or reminder technology could harness clinicians' ability to hyperrespond to produce habitual compliance."

abstract = "Background
Data are limited on risk factors for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia.
Methods
All patients with a confirmed VRE bacteremia in Ontario, Canada, between January 2009 and December 2013 were linked to provincial healthcare administrative data sources and frequency matched to 3 controls based on age, sex, and aggregated diagnosis group. Associations between predictors and VRE bacteremia were estimated by generalized estimating equations and summarized using odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Results
In total, 217 cases and 651 controls were examined. In adjusted analyses, patient-level predictors included bone marrow transplant (OR 106.99 [95% CI 12.19–939.26]); solid organ transplant (OR 17.17 [95% CI 4.95–59.54]); any cancer (OR 8.64 [95% CI 3.88–19.21]); intensive care unit (ICU) admission (OR 6.81 [95% CI 3.53–13.13]); heart disease (OR 5.27 [95% CI 2.00–13.90]); and longer length of stay (OR 1.07 per day [95% CI 1.06–1.09]). Hospital-level predictors included hospital size (per increase in 100 beds (OR 1.26 [95% CI 1.07–1.48]) and teaching hospitals (OR 3.87 [95% CI 1.85–8.08]).
Conclusions
Patients with a bone marrow transplant, solid organ transplant, cancer, or who are admitted to the ICU are at highest risk of VRE bacteremia, particularly at large hospitals and teaching hospitals."

abstract = "Background
Microbiologic surveillance of flexible gastrointestinal endoscopes is recommended in several guidelines as the primary means of identifying reprocessing failures. This study aimed to evaluate the contamination level and prevalence of bacteria of post-reprocessing endoscopes and to access whether using a pump-assisted sampling method (PASM) improves the sensitivity of culture.
Methods
All 59 endoscopy units in Tianjin, China, were investigated. The PASM and the conventional flushing sampling method (CFSM) were used to compare the results of the microbial culture. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the influencing factors.
Results
One hundred four (56.52%) flushing channel samples of gastrointestinal endoscopes were positive for culture, and the maximum bacterial concentration was 14,100 colony-forming units (CFU)/channel. One hundred fifty-one (82.07%) flushing samples were qualified according to the national standard of China (≤ 20 CFU/channel). The qualified rate of the samples collected by PASM was significantly lower than the qualified rate by CFSM (65.52% vs 89.68%). Using PASM (odds ratio [OR]: 4.257; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.870–9.690) would increase the sensitivity of culture. The use of purified water (OR: 0.288; 95% CI: 0.102–0.814) could reduce the risk of endoscope reprocessing failure.
Conclusion
Many endoscopes fail to meet the national standard for microbial culture after reprocessing. Our results suggest that using a pump-assisted method could increase the sensitivity of the test."

Health care-associated infections (HAIs) are avoidable through good hand hygiene (HH) practices. Hand hygiene compliance systems (HHCSs) have been shown to reliably measure HH adherence, but data on their effectiveness at reducing HAI rates are limited.
Methods
This nonrandomized, pre-post intervention study was conducted at a community hospital in the United States. HAI rates were examined before and after implementation of a HHCS. Preintervention began in January 2014 and intervention began in March 2015; data were collected through September 2017. Additional infection-specific interventions were carried out. HAIs were calculated as incidence rate ratios.
Results
The preintervention and intervention periods included 14,297 and 36,890 patients, respectively. The HHCS recorded an average of 696,928 HH opportunities/month. A significant reduction in the rate of catheter-associated urinary tract infections was observed during the intervention: IRR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35-0.87. Similarly, a significant reduction in the rate of central line-associated bloodstream infections was observed: IRR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.23-0.89.
Discussion and conclusions
These findings suggest that monitoring HH practices with an automated system, in addition to other infection control measures, may be an effective means of reducing HAIs. Further studies are needed to isolate the potential role of HHCSs in the reduction of HAIs."

Increased awareness of the epidemiology of transmission of pathogenic bacterial strain characteristics may help to improve compliance with intraoperative infection control measures. Our aim was to characterize the epidemiology of intraoperative transmission of high-risk Staphylococcus aureus sequence types (STs).
Methods
S aureus isolates collected from 3 academic medical centers underwent whole cell genome analysis, analytical profile indexing, and biofilm absorbance. Transmission dynamics for hypertransmissible, strong biofilm-forming, antibiotic-resistant, and virulent STs were assessed.
Results
S aureus ST 5 was associated with increased risk of transmission (adjusted incidence risk ratio, 6.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.82-24.41; P = .0008), greater biofilm absorbance (ST 5 median absorbance ± SD, 3.08 ± 0.642 vs other ST median absorbance ± SD, 2.38 ± 1.01; corrected P = .021), multidrug resistance (odds ratio, 7.82; 95% CI, 2.19-27.95; P = .002), and infection (6/38 ST 5 vs 6/140 STs; relative risk, 3.68; 95% CI, 1.26-10.78; P = .022). Provider hands (n = 3) and patients (n = 4) were confirmed sources of ST 5 transmission. Transmission locations included provider hands (n = 3), patient skin sites (n = 4), and environmental surfaces (n = 2). All observed transmission stories involved the within-case mode of transmission. Two of the ST 5 transmission events were directly linked to infection.
Conclusions
Intraoperative S aureus ST 5 isolates are hypertransmissible and pathogenic. Improved compliance with hand hygiene and patient decolonization may help to control the spread of these dangerous pathogens."

A novel color additive colorizes chlorine disinfectants blue to improve visibility and enhance spray surface coverage, and it fades to colorless to indicate elapsed contact time. We investigated its interactions with 3 chlorine disinfectants to determine if the additive would adversely affect the disinfectants' antimicrobial efficacy or skin safety.
Methods
We tested 0.5% sodium hypochlorite, 0.2% calcium hypochlorite, and 0.5% sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) alone versus with color additive. An independent laboratory tested efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio cholerae, and human coronavirus 229E. An independent laboratory also tested direct skin irritation.
Results
Chlorine disinfectants with and without color additive achieved equal levels of efficacy against the tested pathogens. Against S. aureus, 0.5% sodium hypochlorite with and without color additive met Environmental Protection Agency criteria for disinfection success. Against human coronavirus 229E, 0.5% sodium hypochlorite alone failed disinfection success criteria, whereas 0.5% sodium hypochlorite with color additive achieved full viral inactivation (≥4.50 log10 reduction). Against V. cholerae, 0.2% calcium hypochlorite alone and with color additive achieved 5.99 log10 and >6.03 log10 reductions, respectively. Against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, 0.5% NaDCC with and without color additive achieved >4.9 log10 and >3.54 log10 reductions, respectively. All 3 chlorine disinfectants with color additive tested as negligible skin irritants.
Conclusions
This color additive can be combined with chlorine disinfectants without adversely affecting antimicrobial efficacy or skin safety."

Community-associated Clostridium difficile infection is inconsistently associated with antibiotic exposure. This study uses a self-controlled case series (SCCS) design to estimate antibiotic exposure effect sizes and compare them with those estimated from previous case-control studies.
Methods
We estimated the association between antibiotic exposure and community-associated Clostridium difficile infection among 139,000 patients registered to the Barrie Family Health Team from January 1, 2011, to May 1, 2017, using an SCCS design. Poisson regression analysis was used to estimate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) between antibiotic exposure versus nonexposure periods within individuals. Antibiotic exposure was categorized as either high risk (fluoroquinolone, clindamycin, or cephalosporin) or low risk (all other antibiotic classes).
Results
The final analysis included 189 cases. The pooled IRR for high-risk antibiotics was 2.26 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29, 3.98) and 2.03 (95% CI 1.19, 3.47) for lower-risk antibiotics. There was no difference between high-risk and lower-risk antibiotics (IRR 1.11, 95% CI 0.53, 2.36).
Interpretation
The IRRs were smaller than the odds ratios reported in previous case-control studies, suggesting a less biased estimate because SCCS designs control for time-invariant confounders. Compared with case-control studies, SCCS designs are underused in infection prevention and control studies."

Methods
The purpose of this study was to increase the understanding of experiences and consequences of being an ESBL carrier. A modified version of the grounded theory was used to analyze 16 open interviews.
Results
The analysis resulted in the core category “to handle the new life situation.” The results showed a lack of information being passed by attending doctors to study participants about ESBL and the consequences for their daily lives. This insufficient information initially caused fear and anxiety, leading to participants instead searching for information themselves using the Internet. Armed with this information, they developed strategies to continue with their lives as before. As patients they experienced staff that were respectful, showed no stigmatization toward ESBL carriership, and used correct hygiene routines.
Conclusions
When the information from the attending doctor about ESBL carriers is insufficient, patients often use the Internet to obtain additional information. With the use of this information, patients develop strategies to cope with their lives."

Infections caused by carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacilli are an emerging public health threat. However, there is a paucity of data examining comparative incidence rates, risk factors, and outcomes in this population.
Methods
This single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted at an urban tertiary-care academic medical center. We included patients admitted from 2012 to 2015 who met the following criteria: i) age ≥ 18 years; and ii) culture positive for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) or carbapenem-resistant non-Enterobacteriaceae (CRNE) from any site. Exclusion criteria were: i) < 2 systemic inflammatory response criteria; ii) cystic fibrosis; and iii) no targeted treatment. We evaluated hospital survival by Cox regression and year-by-year differences in the distribution of cases by the Cochran-Armitage test.
Results
448 patients were analyzed (CRE, n = 111 [24.8%]; CRNE, n = 337 [75.2%]). CRE sepsis cases increased significantly over the study period (P < .001), driven primarily by increasing incidence of Enterobacter spp. infection (P = .004). No difference was observed in hospital survival between patients with CRE versus CRNE sepsis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83-2.02; P = .285), even after adjusting for confounding factors (adjusted HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.62-1.87; P = .799).
Conclusions
Clinical outcomes did not differ between patients with CRE versus CRNE sepsis. Dramatic increases in CRE, particularly Enterobacter spp., appear to be causing a shift in the burden of clinically significant carbapenem-resistant gram-negative infection."

Despite recommendations from health care authorities, reports of severe influenza occur yearly among unvaccinated infants and children.
Objectives
This study investigated influenza vaccine coverage and predictive factors for vaccination status among pediatric patients during the 2016-2017 winter influenza season.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey was conducted among parents of our study population identified through a major pediatric outpatient clinic in Hong Kong. Parents with a child aged 6 months to 17 years were invited to complete a questionnaire that assessed the current influenza vaccine status of the child and the parents' understanding and beliefs regarding influenza and its vaccine. A backward logistic regression was conducted to determine predictive factors and adjusted odds ratios associated with influenza vaccine uptake.
Results
Our study included 348 parents and 405 pediatric patients. Of these, 142 pediatric patients (35.1%) received full vaccination. Predictive factors associated with the child's positive influenza vaccine status include a “very good” parental understanding of influenza and its vaccine (adjusted odds ratio, 6.7; 95% confidence interval,  2.1-21.5), a child with chronic medical condition and a “high” cue to action (adjusted odds ratio, 5.7; 95% confidence interval, 2.8-11.6), and a “high” perceived susceptibility toward influenza (adjusted odds ratio, 4.8; 95% confidence interval, 2.1-10.8).
Conclusions
This study reflects the low influenza vaccine coverage among pediatric patients. Interventions focusing on parental knowledge and understanding of influenza and its vaccine may improve future vaccine uptake among the pediatric population."

Results
From April 2015 to June 2016, 73 of 301 ICUs (24%) participated in the survey. MDRO screening was performed on admission in 96% of ICUs, for at least 1 MDRO (78%). MDRO screening was performed weekly during ICU stay in 83% of ICUs. Preemptive isolation was initiated on admission in 82% of ICUs, mostly in a targeted way (71%). Imported and acquired MDRO rates >10% were reported in 44% and 27% of ICUs, respectively. An MDRO outbreak had occurred within the past 3 years in 48% of cases.

Pseudomonas is a group of medically important species that inhabit a wide range of niches, including hospital environments. Controversies have emerged about the possible link between improper use of disinfectants and the emergence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of exposure of antibiotic-susceptible Pseudomonas isolates to sub-inhibitory concentrations of 2 disinfectants—didecyldimonium chloride and sodium hypochlorite—on their antibiotic susceptibility patterns.
Methods
This study involved 50 Pseudomonas isolates. The antibiotic susceptibility patterns of the isolates were assessed using broth microdilution method. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of each antibiotic were compared before and after exposure to sub-inhibitory concentrations of didecyldimonium chloride and sodium hypochlorite.
Results
After overnight incubation with sub-inhibitory concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, a statistically significant increase was observed in the MICs of colistin (P = .012), ceftazidime (P < .001), amikacin (P < .001), meropenem (P < .001), gentamicin (P < .001), piperacillin-tazobactam (P = .003), and ciprofloxacin (P = .004). In contrast, exposure to sub-inhibitory concentrations of didecyldimonium chloride showed a statistically significant increase in the MICs of amikacin (P < .001), gentamicin (P < .001), meropenem (P = .041), and ciprofloxacin (P = .008).

The worldwide spread of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria has affected health care. ESBL confers resistance to the majority of beta-lactam antibiotics.
Materials and Methods
We intended to quantify the rates of rectal ESBL-positive and negative patients that eventually developed fever and urinary tract infection (UTI). All rectal ESBL-positive patients were to be initially treated with the conventional antibiotics that have anti-ESBL activity (amikacin or ertapenem), while ESBL-negative patients were given ceftriaxone.
Results
Most patients were rectal ESBL-positive (60.7%). Fever was in 51% patients; 67.8% of them developed signs and symptoms of UTI. Most patients with UTI were urinary ESBL-positive (79%), most rectal ESBL-negative patients were urinary ESBL-negative (75%), (χ2 = 18.5, df = 1, P < .001). Overall mortality was higher in the febrile group (39, 34.8%) versus the afebrile (1, 0.9%) (χ2 = 42, df = 1, P < .001). The mortality rate in the febrile group was significantly higher in the rectal ESBL-positive patients (χ2 = 7.5, df = 1, P = .006).
Discussion
The direct correlation of rectal ESBL-positive and negative and respectively urinary ESBL-positive and negative patients' advocate for the use of antibiotics with anti-ESBL activity as an empiric treatment of rectal ESBL-positive patients with suspected UTI.
Conclusion
In our opinion, it is worthwhile to identify rectal ESBL-positivity on hospital admission."

This study was conducted to determine predictors for CRE gut colonization in neonates who were hospital delivered and admitted in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
Methods
Three rectal swabs were collected from 300 hospital-delivered and NICU-admitted neonates (likely to stay for >3 days). The data collected for the possible risk factors for CRE gut colonization were namely mode of delivery, prolonged rupture of membrane >18 hours, period of gestation, birth weight, meconium-stained liquor, ventilation, intravenous catheter, nasogastric (NG) tube, NG feeding, breastfeeding, katori spoon feeding, top feeding, expressed breastmilk, antibiotics administration, and duration of hospitalization. P < .05 was considered as statistically significant.
Results
A total of 26 cases of CRE were isolated from 300 neonates. Statistically significant risk factors were found to be NG tube, breastfeeding, NG feeding, top feeding, expressed breastmilk, ventilation, antibiotic administration, and duration of hospitalization. Top feeding and antibiotics administration were identified as 2 independent risk factors by multiple logistic regression.
Conclusions
Active surveillance of cultures from hospitalized patients and implementation of preventive efforts can reduce the risk of CRE."

Halting the spread of harmful microbes requires an understanding of their transmission via hands and fomites. Previous studies explored acute and long-term care environments but not outpatient clinics. Objectives of this study were to track microbial movement throughout an outpatient clinic and evaluate the impact of a disinfectant spray intervention targeting high-touch point surfaces.
Methods
At the start of the clinic day, a harmless viral tracer was placed onto 2 fomites: a patient room door handle and front desk pen. Patient care, cleaning, and hand hygiene practices continued as usual. Facility fomites (n = 19), staff hands (n = 4), and patient hands (n = 3-4) were sampled after 2, 3.5, and 6 hours. Tracer concentrations at baseline (before intervention) were evaluated 6 hours after seeding. For the intervention trials, high-touch surfaces were cleaned 4 hours after seeding with an ethanol-based disinfectant and sampled 2 hours after cleaning.
Results
At 2, 3.5, and 6 hours after seeding, virus was detected on all surfaces and hands sampled, with examination room door handles and nurses’ station chair arms yielding the highest concentrations. Virus concentrations decreased by 94.1% after the disinfectant spray intervention (P = .001).
Conclusions
Microbes spread quickly in an outpatient clinic, reaching maximum contamination levels 2 hours after inoculation, with the highest contamination on examination room door handles and nurses’ station chairs. This study emphasizes the importance of targeted disinfection of high-touch surfaces."

Ventilator-associated events are common in mechanically ventilated patients. They are associated with more days on mechanical ventilation, longer intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and increased risk of mortality. Theoretically, interventions that prevent ventilator-associated events should also reduce associated morbidity. We evaluated the Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program approach to improve the care of mechanically ventilated patients.
Methods
All mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the ICU between October 1, 2015, and October 31, 2016, were prospectively monitored for the development of ventilator-associated events according to the National Healthcare Safety Network criteria. A process care bundle (endotracheal intubation with subglottic suctioning, head-of-bed elevation ≥30°, target sedation scores, daily spontaneous awakening trials, spontaneous breathing trials), daily delirium assessment, and an early mobility protocol were instituted. The bundle compliance, ventilator-associated events rates, ICU length of stay, and mortality rate were noted. The database allowed viewing of current rates, trends, and averages of all participating sites.
Results
In the study period, 2,321 patients were admitted to the ICU, and 1,231 required mechanical ventilation (10,342 ventilator days). There were 115 ventilator-associated events: 82 ventilator-associated conditions, 15 infection-related ventilator-associated conditions, and 18 possible cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia. The ICU mortality rate was 13.3%, compared with 28.7% for those mechanically ventilated patients with ventilator-associated events (P = .0001). There was increased compliance for spontaneous awakening trials (51.5%-76.9%, P = .0008) and spontaneous breathing trials (54.2%-72.2%, P = .02) and a decrease in infection-related ventilator-associated conditions (4.2-3.5 per 1,000 days), possible cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia (2.1-1.7 per 1,000 days), ICU mortality (45.3%-19.1%, P = .045), and ventilator-associated events associated mortality rates (33.3%-8.3%, P < .37). Physical therapy participation and mobility were 60.8% and 26.4%, respectively.
Conclusion
The implementation of a multipronged program like the Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program could improve the care processes and outcomes of mechanically ventilated patients."

Central line–associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are among the most common hospital-acquired infections and can lead to increased patient morbidity and mortality rates. Implementation of practice guidelines and recommended prevention bundles has historically been suboptimal, suggesting that improvements in implementation methods could further reductions in CLABSI rates. In this article, we describe the agile implementation methodology and present details of how it was successfully used to reduce CLABSI.
Methods
We conducted an observational study of patients with central line catheters at 2 adult tertiary care hospitals in Indianapolis from January 2015 to June 2017.
Results
The intervention successfully reduced the CLABSI rate from 1.76 infections per 1,000 central line days to 1.24 (rate ratio = 0.70; P = .011).

Exposure to natural rubber latex, primarily through the use of gloves, is a well-recognized cause of occupational asthma. We investigated latex glove use among Australian workers and estimated the resultant burden of occupational asthma among healthcare workers (HCWs).
Methods
Data were collected in 2014 as part of the Australian Work Exposures Study-Asthma, a telephone survey investigating the prevalence of current occupational exposure to asthmagens, including latex. We estimated adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) to determine variables associated with the use of latex gloves among HCWs and calculated the asthma-related disability-adjusted life years due to latex exposure among HCWs.
Results
Latex gloves were used by 22% of respondents. Almost two-thirds (63%) of HCWs reported wearing latex gloves, with 26% using powdered latex gloves. The use of latex gloves was more common among those employed in micro companies (less than 5 employees) than large companies (200+ employees) (aPR = 1.5, 95% confidence interval 1.1-2.0). Latex exposure in HCWs was estimated to contribute 3% of the total asthma-related burden.
Discussion
Latex gloves are widely used by Australian workers and by HCWs in particular.
Conclusions
This is the first estimate of the burden of asthma attributable to occupational exposure to latex among HCWs. These results can be used to guide decisions regarding the control of occupational exposure to latex."

Nursing has been called for greater participation in antibiotic stewardship. Although many of the functions that are integral to successful stewardship are within the scope of bedside nurses, data evaluating nursing engagement in stewardship are limited. The objective of this study was to identify nurses' roles and confidence in engaging in stewardship practices by conducting a survey of pediatric staff nurses employed at a 354-bed freestanding children's hospital with a well-established prospective audit and feedback stewardship program.
Methods
An investigator-developed online survey was used to assess 10 identified practices that fall within the responsibility of inpatient nurses and contribute to the stewardship process.
Results
One hundred and eighty nurses participated in the study. Nurses were highly confident assessing for an adverse drug reaction history, obtaining cultures prior to antibiotics, and participating in patient education. They were less confident in reviewing microbiology results to determine antibiotic appropriateness. Clinical practice and hospital culture influenced perceptions of the nursing role in stewardship. Reported barriers to stewarding included nurses not included in rounds, interdisciplinary power differentials, and nursing input not actively sought.
Conclusions
Barriers to nurse engagement were identified and could be addressed by improving education in microbiology and principles of antibiotic use along with more consistent inclusion of nurses in bedside rounds while also cultivating an environment where nurse contribution is actively sought."

Few hospitals have conducted surveillance cultures to identity carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) colonization in Korea because of high test costs, long wait time to get results, and lack of personnel. This study aimed to identify risk factors of CRE colonization and to develop a model for predicting the risk of CRE colonization.
Methods
This retrospective cohort study was done with medical record review at a tertiary hospital between October 1, 2016, and October 31, 2017, in 444 adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit. The identification of risk factors and risk model development were done by multiple logistic regression. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve and correct classification were measured.
Results
The risk prediction logistic model for CRE colonization was composed of 4 factors among 22 significant variables on univariate analysis and 1 interaction term; E (logit of CRE colonization) = −2.821 + 1.606 (isolation of multidrug-resistant organisms) + 1.347 (≥15 days of cephalosporin administration) + 0.980 (≥15 days of carbapenem administration) + 0.544 (score ≥21 on Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II). The risk prediction model showed 0.80 (95% confidence interval, 0.74-0.85) for the area under the curve, and 68.9% correct classification.
Conclusions
It is recommended to utilize the risk prediction model to screen out for the colonization of CRE, and to do validation studies for verifying the generalizability."

There have been reported outbreaks of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae infections linked to endoscopes with elevator mechanisms. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) testing has been used as a marker for bioburden and monitoring manual cleaning for flexible endoscopes with and without an elevator mechanism. The objective of this study was to determine whether routine ATP testing could identify areas of improvement in cleaning of endoscopes with an elevator mechanism.
Methods
ATP testing after manual cleaning of TJF-Q180V duodenoscopes and GF-UCT180 linear echoendoscopes (Olympus America Inc, Center Valley, PA) was implemented. Samples were tested from the distal end, the elevator mechanism, and water flushed through the lumen of the biopsy channel. Data were recorded and compared by time point, test point, and reprocessing technician.
Results
Overall failure rate was 6.99% (295 out of 4,219). The highest percentage of failed ATP tests (17.05%) was reported in the first quarter of routine testing, with an overall decrease in rates over time. The elevator mechanism and working channel lumen had higher failure rates than the distal end. Quality of manual cleaning between reprocessing technicians showed variation.
Conclusion
ATP testing is effective in identifying residual organic material and improving quality of manual cleaning of endoscopes with an elevator mechanism. Cleaning efficacy is influenced by reprocessing technicians and location tested on the endoscope. Close attention to the working channel and elevator mechanism during manual cleaning is warranted."

Surgical site infections (SSIs) are a substantial burden to healthcare systems in North America. Administrative data is one method though which these may be identified, but the accuracy of using such data is uncertain.
Methods
We followed a population-based cohort of patients who received primary hip/knee arthroplasty in Alberta, Canada, for whom a comprehensive Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) prospective surveillance methodology was used to track SSIs. Patients were also followed using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes. We assessed the sensitivity/specificity and positive/negative predictive values of ICD-10 codes compared to IPC surveillance.
Results
Between April 1, 2012, and March 31, 2015, 24,512 people received hip/knee arthroplasty. Of these, 258 (1.05%) had a complex SSI found by IPC surveillance. Sensitivity and specificity of ICD-10 codes in identifying complex SSIs after hip/knee arthroplasty were 85.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 80.3%-89.4%) and 99.5% (95% CI 99.4%-99.6%), respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 63.6% (95% CI 58.3%-68.7%) and 99.8% (95% CI 99.8%-99.9%), respectively.
Discussion
Administrative data have reasonable testing characteristics for identifying complex SSIs after arthroplasty. For centers without prospective surveillance programs, this could be useful in identifying hospitals with frequent complex SSIs after arthroplasty.
Conclusions
A comprehensive IPC surveillance program is superior at detecting SSIs after arthroplasty."

Candidemia in children caused by non-albicans Candida (NAC) spp is increasing in prevalence, but the relevant information is limited.
Methods
All isolates of pediatric candidemia from a medical center in Taiwan between 2003 and 2015 were enrolled. The characteristics of patients with NAC and Candida albicans candidemia (CAC) were compared.
Results
Among the 319 episodes of candidemia occurring in 262 patients, C albicans accounted for 46.4%. The NAC and CAC groups had no significant differences in demographics, underlying diseases, most risk factors, and clinical characteristics. Patients in the NAC group were significantly more likely to have fluconazole exposure (14.0% vs 6.8%, respectively; P = .045), and NAC species accounted for 70.2% of all recurrent episodes. NAC candidemia had a longer duration of candidemia (median, 3.0 vs 1.0 days after effective antifungal treatment, respectively; P = .001), slower responses to antifungal treatment, and a higher rate of treatment failure than CAC. However, the 2 groups had similar 30-day candidemia-attributable mortality rates. After multivariate logistic regression, longer duration of central venous catheter was the independent risk factor for NAC candidemia in children (odds ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.35 for every 10-day increment).
Conclusions
NAC species collectively have emerged as the predominant pathogens of candidemia in children. Prolonged use of a central venous catheter is associated with an increased risk of candidemia caused by NAC species."

Methods
Using data captured by a national point-prevalence survey (the Aged Care National Antimicrobial Prescribing Survey), risk and protective factors were determined by multivariate Poisson regression.
Results
In 2017, 292 facilities were surveyed. Infection prevalence was 2.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6%-3.2%), and antimicrobial use prevalence was 8.9% (95% CI, 8.4%-9.4%). Resident-level factors associated with infection prevalence included urinary catheterization and hospital admission within the last 30 days; facility-level factors included state and multipurpose service provision. Resident-level factors associated with antimicrobial prescribing included infection signs and symptoms; facility-level factors included state, nonmetropolitan locality, and not-for-profit status. Availability of guidelines for urinary tract infection (UTI) management was associated with reduced antimicrobial prescribing.
Conclusions
Looking ahead, reports should be peer grouped by significant facility-level factors. Priority should be given to implementing UTI management guidelines and prevention of infection in residents with indwelling urinary catheters. Enhanced monitoring and prevention strategies are required for residents recently admitted to hospital."

This study examined how the public discussed measles during the measles outbreak in the United States during early 2015 that originated in Disneyland Park in Anaheim, CA, through a semantic network analysis of the content of around 1 million tweets using KH coder.
Results
Four frames were identified based on word frequencies and co-occurrence: news update, public health, vaccination, and political. The prominence of each individual frame changed over the corse of the pre-crisis, initial, maintenance, and resolution stages of the outbreak.
Conclusions
This study proposed and tested a method for assessing the frames used in social media discussions about EIDs based on the creation, interpretation, and quantification of semantic networks. Public health agencies could use social media outlets, such as Twitter, to assess how the public makes sense of an EID outbreak and to create adaptive messages in communicating with the public during different stages of the crisis."

Earlobes and fingers of 200 nurses (128 nurses with pierced earlobes and 72 nurses with unpierced earlobes) working at a university hospital were sampled to determine whether cross-transmission of bacteria-colonized pierced earring holes and fingers in nurse is possible.
Results
Of 128 nurses who had pierced earring holes, Staphylococcus aureus was recovered from earlobes of 24 nurses (18.8%) compared with 7 of 72 nurses without pierced earring holes (9.7%) (P = .09). Of those 15 nurses yielding S aureus from both earlobes and fingers, 12 were from nurses who had pierced earring holes compared with 3 nurses without pierced earring holes. Excluding 1 nurse, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and genotypes of S aureus from both earlobe and fingers of each nurse were identical.
Conclusion
Pierced earlobes can be a source of health care-associated infection via cross-transmission of bacteria from earlobe holes to fingers."

Numerous state health departments (SHDs) have validated central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) data, and results from these studies provide important insights into the accuracy of CLABSI reporting to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) and remediable shortcomings in adherence to the CLABSI definition and criteria.
Methods
State CLABSI validation results were obtained from peer-reviewed publications, reports on SHD Web sites, and via personal communications with the SHD health care–associated infections coordinator. Data accuracy measures included pooled mean sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Total CLABSI error rate was computed as the proportion of mismatches among total records reviewed. When available, reasons for CLABSI misclassification reported by SHDs were reviewed.
Results
At least 23 SHDs that have completed CLABSI validations indicated sensitivity (pooled mean, 82.9%), specificity (pooled mean, 98.5%), positive predictive value (pooled mean, 94.1%), and negative predictive value (pooled mean, 95.9%) of CLABSI reporting. The pooled error rate of CLABSI reporting was 4.4%.

CLABSI underreporting remains a major concern; validations conducted by SHDs provide an important impetus for improved reporting. SHDs are uniquely positioned to engage facilities in collaborative validation reviews that allow transparency, education, and relationship building."

Antimicrobial stewardship is recommended as a crucial mechanism to reduce the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. The purpose of this article was to describe implementation of antimicrobial management programs (AMPs) across a large health system of community hospitals.
Methods
The initiative was structured in 4 phases. Although each phase was implemented sequentially, facilities could progress at their own pace. Phase goals needed to be met before moving to the next phase. The 4 phases included preparatory, foundational, clinical care optimization, and refinement. A survey was administered prior to the initiative in 2010, and modified surveys were administered in 2015 and 2017.
Results
Stewardship activities improved in most areas of the AMP initiative in 2015, with substantial improvement by 2017. Important changes included an increase in established programs, from 82% in 2010 to 88% and 96% in 2015 and 2017, respectively. Physician Champions increased from 73% in 2010 to 94% in 2017. Advances were made in the use of evidence-based treatment recommendations, antibiogram development, prospective audit and feedback for antimicrobials, tracking of antibiotic usage metrics, and a cost reduction of 40% from baseline.
Conclusion
A well-designed, phased approach to implementing AMP can help community hospitals and hospital systems recognize substantial clinical and financial benefits."

abstract = "Background
Health care-associated infections pose a significant problem in nursing homes (NHs). The Long-term Care Facility Component of the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) was launched in 2012, and since then, enrollment of NHs into NHSN has been deemed a national priority. Our goal was to understand the characteristics of NHs reporting to the NHSN compared to other NHs across the country.
Methods
To meet this goal, we quantified the characteristics of NHs by NHSN enrollment status and reporting consistency using the Certification and Survey Provider Enhanced Reporting (CASPER) data linked to NHSN enrollment and reporting data.
Results
Of the 16,081 NHs in our sample, 262 (or 1.6% of NHs) had enrolled in NHSN by the end of 2015; these early adopting facilities were more likely to be for-profit and had a higher percentage of Medicare residents. By the end of 2016, enrollment expanded by more than 5-fold to 1,956 facilities (or 12.2% of NHs). In our analysis, the characteristics of those later adopting NHs were more similar to NHs nationally than the early adopters. Specifically, bed size and hospital-based facilities were related to both early and late adoption of NHSN.
Conclusions
The types of NHs that have enrolled in NHSN have changed substantially since the program began. The increased enrollment was likely due to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid (CMS)-funded “C. difficile Infection (CDI) Reporting and Reduction Project” that incentivized Quality Innovation Network-Quality Improvement Organizations (QIN-QIOs) to support NH enrollment and participation in NHSN. Further understanding of a facility's ability to enroll in and maintain reporting to NHSN, and how this relates to infection prevention staffing and infrastructure in NHs and infection rates among NH residents, is needed."

Covering the instrument table during surgery may decrease contamination. We hypothesized that (1) covering the instrument table in an operating room (OR) during static periods of nonuse and dynamic periods of active use would dramatically decrease the bacterial bioburden on the table, and (2) the use of sterile plastic table covers would be equivalent to sterile impervious paper covers in reducing the bioburden in a dynamic environment.
Methods
Bacterial contamination of the instrument table was evaluated by settle plates in static and dynamic ORs. Airborne particulate and bacterial contaminants were sampled throughout the room. Tested groups included instrument tables covered with sterile impervious paper covers, sterile plastic covers, or no covers.
Results
Covering the instrument table during static and dynamic operating room conditions resulted in a significantly decreased bacterial load on the instrument table. No differences were seen between paper and plastic covers.
Conclusions
A significant decrease in bacterial bioburden on the instrument table when the table was covered during static and dynamic periods was observed, suggesting the utility for covering the instrument table during periods of nonuse and during active surgeries."

Methods
We fit 3 models to data from patients undergoing operations at the University of Colorado Hospital between 2013 and 2015: a similar model reported previously in the literature, a comprehensive model with 136 possible predictors, and a combination of those. All models used a generalized linear model with a lasso penalty. Several techniques for handling imbalance in the outcome were also used: Youden's J statistic to optimize the probability cutoff and sampling techniques combined with Youden's J. The models were then tested on data from patients undergoing operations during 2016.
Results
Two hundred thirty of 6,840 patients (3.4%) had an SSI. The comprehensive model fit to the full set of training data performed the best, achieving 90% specificity, 80% sensitivity, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.89.
Conclusions
We identified a model that accurately identified SSIs. The framework presented can be easily implemented by other American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-participating hospitals to develop models for enhancing surveillance of SSIs."

The aim of this study was to describe the risk of self-contamination associated with doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE) and to compare self-contamination with various PPE protocols.
Methods
We tested 10 different PPE donning and doffing protocols, recommended by various health organizations for Ebola. Ten participants were recruited for this study and randomly assigned to use 3 different PPE protocols. After donning of PPE, fluorescent lotion and spray were applied on the external surface of the PPE to simulate contamination, and ultraviolet light was used to count fluorescent patches on the skin.
Results
After testing 30 PPE sequences, large fluorescent patches were recorded after using “WHO coverall and 95” and “North Carolina coverall and N95” sequences, and small patches were recorded after using “CDC coverall and N95” and “Health Canada gown and N95” sequences. Commonly reported problems with PPE use were breathing difficulty, suffocation, heat stress, and fogging-up glasses. Most participants rated PPE high (18/30) or medium (11/30) for ease of donning/doffing and comfort. PPE sequences with powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) and assisted doffing were generally associated with fewer problems and were rated the highest.
Conclusion
This study confirmed the risk of self-contamination associated with the doffing of PPE. PAPR-containing protocols and assisted doffing should be preferred whenever possible during the outbreak of highly infectious pathogens."

Background
Grouping patients who acquired resistant microorganisms within a single area (cohorting) has been used to prevent cross-transmission. We aimed to assess cohorting effectiveness in the absence of an outbreak.
Methods
An interrupted time series study was performed in a general hospital considering patients admitted to wards. In the first year, patients who acquired multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria were isolated without physical transfer. In the second year, cohorting was implemented, and patients with mixed MDR bacteria were transferred to individual rooms in a specific isolation unit. Cultures were requested upon clinician orders, and surveillance or routine cultures were not performed. The effect of cohorting on the incidence density of MDR bacteria acquisition was assessed using segmented regression analysis.
Results
In the first and second years, 2.0 and 2.8 cases per 1,000 patient-days acquired MDR bacteria. The length of hospitalization and mortality rate were similar between phases. There was a linear increase of the monthly incidence densities of MDR bacteria acquisition in the first year (β1: 0.11; 95% confidence interval [CI]: –0.02 to 0.24), though without an immediate impact of cohorting (β2: –1.32; 95% CI: –3.81 to 1.16) or a change in the temporal trend (β3: 0.04; 95% CI: –0.14 to 0.23) from the first to second phase.
Conclusion
Cohorting may not reduce the incidence density of MDR bacteria acquisition in the absence of an outbreak."

Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are a significant contributor to adverse patient outcomes and excess cost of inpatient care. Adjunct ultraviolet-C (UV-C) disinfection may be a viable strategy for reducing HAIs. This study aimed to measure the clinical, operational, and financial impact of a UV-C terminal disinfection intervention in a community hospital setting.
Methods
Using a pre-post study design, we compared the HAI rates of 5 multidrug-resistant bacteria (Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) from 6 culture sites before and after a 12-month facility-wide UV-C intervention. To measure impact of UV-C disinfection on hospital operations, mean inpatient emergency room wait time was calculated. Finally, we conducted a cost saving analysis to evaluate the financial benefits of the intervention.
Results
Overall, 245 HAIs among 13,177 inpatients were observed during a 12-month intervention period, with an incidence rate of 3.94 per 1,000 patient days. This observed HAIs incidence was 19.2% lower than the preintervention period (4.87 vs 3.94 per 1,000 patient days; P = .006). The intervention did not adversely impact emergency department admissions (297.9 vs 296.2 minutes; P = .18) and generated a direct cost savings of $1,219,878 over a 12-month period.
Conclusions
The UV-C disinfection intervention was associated with a statistically significant facility-wide reduction of multidrug-resistant HAIs and generated substantial direct cost savings without adversely impacting hospital operations."

abstract = "Background
A national survey conducted in 2012 revealed that the rates of regular use of many evidence-based practices to prevent device-associated infections were low in Japanese hospitals. We conducted a second survey 4 years later to evaluate changes in infection prevention practices.
Methods
Between July 2016 and January 2017, the instrument used in a survey of Japanese hospitals in 2012 was sent to 1,456 Japanese hospitals. The survey assessed general hospital and infection prevention program characteristics and use of practices specific to preventing catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Independent sample chi-square tests were used to compare prevention practice rates between the first and second surveys.
Results
A total of 685/971 (71%) and 940/1,456 (65%) hospitals responded to the first and second surveys, respectively. For CAUTI, only use of bladder ultrasound scanners (11.1%-18.1%; P < .001) increased. For CLABSI, use of chlorhexidine gluconate for insertion site antisepsis (18.5%-41.1%; P < .001), antimicrobial dressing with chlorhexidine (3.4%-7.1%; P = .001), and central line insertion bundle (22.9%-33.0%; P < .001) increased. For VAP, use of semirecumbent positioning of patients (65.0%-72.3%; P = .002), sedation vacation (31.5%-41.6%; P < .001), oscillating/kinetic beds (4.7%-8.6%; P = .002), and a collective VAP prevention bundle (24.8%-34.8%; P < .001) increased. Fewer than 50% of Japanese hospitals reported conducting CAUTI and VAP surveillance.
Conclusions
Collaborative approaches and stronger incentives promoting infection prevention efforts may be warranted to further increase use of most evidence-based practices to reduce common health care-associated infections in Japan."

Central line–associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) cause substantial morbidity and increase antimicrobial use and length of stay among hospitalized children in the United States. CLABSI occurs more frequently among high-risk pediatric patients, such as those with intestinal failure (IF) who are parenteral nutrition (PN) dependent. Following an increase in CLABSI rates, a quality improvement (QI) initiative was implemented.
Methods
Using QI methodology, an enhanced central venous catheter (CVC) maintenance bundle was developed and implemented on 2 units for pediatric PN-dependent patients with IF. CLABSI rates were prospectively monitored pre- and postimplementation, and bundle element adherence was monitored. Enhanced bundle elements included chlorhexidine-impregnated patch, daily bathing, ethanol locks, 2 nurses for CVC care in a distraction-free zone, peripheral laboratory draws, bundling routine laboratory tests, and PN administration set changes every 24 hours.
Results
Adherence to enhanced bundle elements increased to >90% over 3 months. CLABSI rates averaged 1.41 per 1,000 central line days preimplementation compared with 0.40 per 1,000 device days postimplementation (P = .003), an 85% absolute reduction in CLABSI rates over 12 months.

Results
From 121 identified articles, 5 studies involving 824 patients were included in the review (822 patients included in meta-analysis). No statistical significance in the incidence of UTIs existed between the water group and antiseptics group (RR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.77-1.49; P = .89; I2 = 0%).

Results
Only a minority of patients (24%) comment to medical personnel about maintaining hygiene, while a majority (67%-69%) took active steps to maintain a hygienic environment. The main variables that were found to be associated with patients' making comments were level of religiousness and gender, whereas priorities, namely whether hospital infections were a high priority, and the frequency of the patient's visits to hospital outpatient clinics, were associated with self-initiated action.

Hand hygiene (HH) compliance in health care is usually measured against versions of the World Health Organization's “Your 5 Moments” guidelines using direct observation. Such techniques result in small samples that are influenced by the presence of an observer. This study demonstrates that continuous electronic monitoring of individuals can overcome these limitations.
Methods
An electronic real-time prompting system collected HH data on a musculoskeletal rehabilitation unit for 12 weeks between October 2016 and October 2017. Aggregate and professional group scores and the distributions of individuals’ performance within groups were analyzed. Soiled utility room exits were monitored and compared with performance at patient rooms. Duration of patient room visits and the number of consecutive missed opportunities were calculated.
Results
Overall, 76,130 patient room and 1,448 soiled utility room HH opportunities were recorded from 98 health care professionals. Aggregate unit performance for patient and soiled utility rooms were both 67%, although individual compliance varied greatly. The number of hand wash events that occurred while inside patient rooms increased with longer visits, whereas HH performance at patient room exit decreased. Eighty-three percent of missed HH opportunities occurred as part of a series of missed events, not in isolation.
Conclusions
Continuous collection of HH data that includes temporal, spatial, and personnel details provides information on actual HH practices, whereas direct observation or dispenser counts show only aggregate trends."

Isolating infectious patients is essential to reduce infection risk. Effectiveness depends on identifying infectious patients, transferring them to suitable accommodations, and maintaining precautions.
Methods
Online study to address identification of infectious patients, transfer, and challenges of maintaining isolation in hospitals in the United Kingdom.
Results
Forty-nine responses were obtained. Decision to isolate is made by infection prevention teams, clinicians, and managers. Respondents reported situations where isolation was impossible because of the patient's physical condition or cognitive status. Very sick patients and those with dementia were not thought to tolerate isolation well. Patients were informed about the need for isolation by ward nurses, sometimes with explanations from infection prevention teams. Explanations were often poorly received and comprehended, resulting in complaints. Respondents were aware of ethical dilemmas associated with isolation that is undertaken in the interests of other health service users and society. Organizational failures could delay initaiting isolation. Records were kept of the demand for isolation and/or uptake, but quality was variable.
Conclusion
Isolation has received the most attention in countries with under-provision of accommodations. Our study characterizes reasons for delays in identifying patients and failures of isolation, which place others at risk and which apply to any organization regardless of availability. It also highlights the ethical dilemmas of enforcing isolation."

Clinical decision support (CDS) systems can help investigators use best practices when responding to outbreaks, but variation in guidelines between jurisdictions can make such systems hard to develop and implement. This study aimed to identify (1) the extent to which state-level guidelines adhere to national recommendations for norovirus outbreak response in health care settings and (2) the impact of variation between states on outbreak outcomes.
Methods
State guidelines were obtained from Internet searches and direct contact with state public health officials in early 2016. Outcomes from norovirus outbreaks that occurred in 2015 were compared using data from the National Outbreak Reporting System.
Results
Guidelines were obtained from 41 of 45 (91%) state health departments that responded to queries or had guidelines available on their Web sites. Most state guidelines addressed each of the national recommendations, but specific guidance varied considerably. For example, among 36 states with guidance on numbers of stool specimens to collect, there were 21 different recommendations. Furthermore, having guidelines consistent with national recommendations was associated with fewer outbreaks reported and more outbreaks with confirmed etiology.
Conclusions
This study identified substantial variation in state health care–associated norovirus outbreak response guidelines, which must be considered when developing related CDS systems. More research is needed to understand why this variation exists, how it impacts outbreak outcomes, and where improvements in evidence-based recommendations and communication of national guidance are needed."

Healthcare-associated Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in pregnant/postpartum women is underreported, especially outside of North America. We report a cluster of cases in 2 neighboring secondary care hospitals in South-East England. The objective of this study was to identify the epidemiology and risk factors for infection.
Methods
An investigation into a cluster of cases of confirmed CDI in pregnant/postpartum women was performed over a 12-month period, from June 2016 to June 2017.
Results
Eleven cases, in 10 patients, were identified, including 1 patient who had a relapse. Eight of 10 patients developed symptoms after hospital discharge. All patients had received broad-spectrum antibiotics prior to CDI onset. Environmental vectors, such as labor room mattresses, that were found difficult to effectively decontaminate after heavy contamination with blood, feces, and other body fluids may have been possible reservoirs. An infection control care bundle was successful in preventing further cases.
Conclusions
Antibiotic use and exposure to the organism in a contaminated labor room environment are likely risk factors for healthcare-associated CDI in postpartum women. Active surveillance is necessary to prevent these infections, as these cases often present after hospital discharge."

Although direct human observation of hand hygiene (HH) is considered the gold standard for measuring HH compliance, its accuracy is challenged by the Hawthorne effect.
Objectives
To compare HH compliance using both overt and covert methods of direct observation in different professional categories, hospital settings, and HH indications.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted in 28 units at King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between October 2012 and July 2013. Compliance was defined as performing handrubbing or handwashing during 1 of the World Health Organization 5 Moments for HH indications (ie, opportunities). Overt observation was done by infection preventionists (IPs) who were doing their routine HH observation. Covert observation was done by unrecognized temporarily hired professionally trained observers.
Results
A total of 15,883 opportunities were observed using overt observation and 7,040 opportunities were observed using covert observation. Overall HH compliance was 87.1% versus 44.9% using overt/covert observations, respectively (risk ratio, 1.94; P < .001). The significant overestimation was seen across all professional categories, hospital settings, and HH indications.
Conclusion
There is a considerable difference in HH compliance being observed overtly and covertly in all categories. More work is required to improve the methodology of direct observation to minimize the influence of the Hawthorne effect."

Bladder irrigation can be performed to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), but its efficacy has been not reported in short-term indwelling urinary catheterization. This clinical trial aimed to examine the efficacy of bladder irrigation with normal saline solution in preventing CAUTI in comatose patients admitted to intensive care units.
Materials and methods
Eligible patients were randomized to the experimental group or control group. The experimental group received daily bladder irrigation with 450 cc sterile normal saline, in 3 150-mL doses, for 3 consecutive days. Data on signs of CAUTI, including urine culture, axillary body temperature (primary outcomes), and other urine and blood parameters (secondary outcomes) were obtained at baseline and 5 days later.
Results
Results of group comparisons and logistic regression analysis that controlled for fluid intake showed that the risk of CAUTI decreased by 99% in the experimental group compared with the control group (odds ratio, 0.01; P < .001). Additional findings indicated a decrease in axillary body temperature and improvements in urine appearance, urinary red cells and white cells, and erythrocyte sedimentation rates and white-cell counts in the blood following bladder irrigation.
Conclusion
Daily bladder irrigation with normal saline during 3 days demonstrated efficacy in preventing CAUTI in comatose patients."

Acrylic nails harbor more bacteria than natural nails, and wear is not recommended for health care workers (HCWs). Little is known about the new and popular gel nail products. This study sought to evaluate the bacterial burden of gel nails, standard nail polish, and natural nails on the hands of HCWs.
Methods
The study was conducted at 3 health centers. Nails on the dominant hand of 88 HCWs were painted with gel polish and standard polish. Cultures were obtained on days 1, 7, and 14 of wear and before and after hand hygiene with alcohol hand gel.
Results
A total of 741 cultures were obtained. Bacterial burden increased over time for all nail types (P ≤ .0001). Reductions in the bacterial burden of natural nails and standard polish, but not gel polish, (P = .001, P = .0028, and P = .98, respectively) were seen after hand hygiene. All 3 nail types become more contaminated with bacteria over time. Standard polish and natural nails may be more amenable to hand hygiene than gel polish.
Conclusions
This study did not show an increased number of microorganisms on nails with gel polish; however, gel nails may be more difficult to clean using alcohol hand gel."

The 2015 APIC MegaSurvey was completed by 4,078 members to assess infection prevention practices. This study's purpose was to examine MegaSurvey results to relate infection preventionist (IP) certification status with demographic characteristics, organizational structure, compensation benefits, and practice and competency factors.
Methods
Descriptive statistics were used to examine population characteristics and certification status. Bivariate logistic regression was performed to evaluate relationships between independent variables and certification status. Variables demonstrating statistical significance (P < .05) were included in multivariable logistic regression analyses.
Results
Forty-seven percent of survey respondents had their CIC. IPs were less likely certified if their educational attainment was less than a bachelor's degree, they were aged 18-45 years, they worked in rural facilities, they had <16 years' experience in health care before becoming an IP, and the percentage of job dedicated to infection prevention was <75%. However, certification was associated with CIC benefit paid fully by employer, self-rating as proficient and expert-advanced, and surveillance and epidemiologic investigation competency obtained via professional development and training.
Conclusions
CIC attainment was associated with IP characteristics. Additional research should focus on identifying strategies to increase certification among noncertified IPs because CIC is a measure of proficiency that should be a goal for all IPs."

abstract = "Background
A major limitation to developing evidence-based approaches to infection prevention is the paucity of real-time, quantitative methods for monitoring the cleanliness of environmental surfaces in clinical settings. One solution that has been proposed is adenosine triphosphate (ATP) bioluminescence assays, but this method does not provide information about the source of the ATP.
Materials/Methods
To address this gap, we conducted a study in which ATP bioluminescence was coupled with traditional RODAC sampling and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry to assess which organisms were viable and present. Using this mixed assessment approach, we evaluated cleaning of 5 different types of high-touch surfaces (overhead lights, door handles, anesthesia keyboards, mattresses, and side tables) in operating rooms.
Results
Whether surfaces tested cleaner after turnaround than they did before turnaround depended on the surface type. Before and after cleaning, flat, covered surfaces (mattresses and side tables) were more likely to pass as “clean” by ATP assay than uncovered, irregularly shaped surfaces (overhead lights, door handles, and anesthesia keyboards). Irregularly shaped surfaces were more likely to pass by RODAC assay than by ATP assay after cleaning.
Conclusion
Our results suggest that irregularly shaped surfaces in operating rooms may require enhanced covering, cleaning, and monitoring protocols compared to more regularly shaped surfaces."

Antimicrobial use is one of the largest modifiable risk factors for development of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). We sought to determine if a recent diagnosis of CDI affected the appropriateness of subsequent antimicrobial prescribing.
Methods
This study is a retrospective electronic chart review of the Greater Los Angeles Veterans Administration. Medication administration records were reviewed for all patients with new CDI from 2015-2016 to determine the appropriateness (drug choice, duration, and dosage) of all non-CDI antimicrobials prescribed within 90 days pre- and post-initial CDI (iCDI) positive testing.
Results
Of the 210 patients diagnosed with new-onset iCDI, 140 met inclusion criteria. Of antimicrobial courses prescribed, 40.6% of pre-iCDI were inappropriate compared with 43.1% of post-iCDI, demonstrating no difference in prescribing habits (P = .717). Thirty-three patients developed recurrent CDI (rCDI). After adjustment for other known risk factors, inappropriate antimicrobial use was associated with a significant increased risk of recurrence compared with appropriate use alone (odds ratio [OR], 6.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.45-26.42). Antimicrobial use in general was associated with increased recurrence compared with no antimicrobial use post-iCDI (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.16-5.84); however, after adjustment, it was no longer significant (OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 0.90-5.04).
Conclusions
The appropriateness of antimicrobial prescribing was not affected by the diagnosis of recent CDI. Inappropriate antimicrobial use after iCDI was associated with higher risk of rCDI."

National guidelines recommend intraoperative redosing of prophylactic antibiotics at defined intervals to reduce the risk of surgical site infections. Compliance with these guidelines is poor.
Methods
A quality improvement project—including education, progress reports, and automated redosing reminders in the anesthesia electronic health record—was implemented at a large university-affiliated hospital to increase rates of intraoperative antibiotic redosing for surgeries lasting more than 4 hours. A retrospective, observational study was then conducted. The primary outcome was the compliance rate with intraoperative antibiotic redosing criteria for all surgeries lasting more than 4 hours in the pre- and post-project period. The effect of the intervention was assessed by an interrupted time-series Poisson regression model.
Results
A total of 13,695 surgical procedures were evaluated. Time-series analysis demonstrated that the project was associated with significant improvement of compliance rates (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 1.16; P = .002) with no significant change in underlying improvement trend (IRR: 1.00; P = .22).
Discussion
Few peer-reviewed manuscripts describe effective methods to ensure appropriate antibiotic redosing during prolonged surgeries. We demonstrated that a multipronged approach was very effective at producing immediate and sustained improvements in guideline compliance.
Conclusions
Implementation of a multifaceted intervention improved rates of guideline-concordant redosing of intraoperative prophylactic antibiotics."

Children in child care settings have a high infectious burden. They are frequently exposed to sanitizing and disinfecting agents, whose toxicities have not been studied in these settings. Current guidance on the preferred disinfection agents for child care is vague.
Methods
This article combines 2 different sources of information: the Environmental Protection Agency registration data on the efficacy of hospital-grade disinfectants and a review of the research on the toxicities of the most common of these disinfectants to summarize information that could be used for more evidence-based early care and education disinfection regulations and guidelines.
Results
Coverage of these organisms varied both between disinfectant classes (defined by active ingredient), as well as within classes. The 3 most common active ingredients in the database—quaternary ammonias, bleaches, and hydrogen peroxides—had 251, 63, and 31 products, respectively. Quaternary ammonias and bleaches are both known asthmagens, with the potential for toxic gas release when mixed. Quaternary ammonias may also cause reproductive toxicity. Disinfectant-grade peroxides have relatively low inhalational toxicity.
Conclusions
A clear rationale is needed to establish policies for determining preferable disinfection products for use in child care settings, based on efficacy against relevant pathogens, toxicity, ease of use, and cost. When other factors are equal, the use of peroxide-based disinfectant products is recommended to minimize inhalational toxicity."

We conducted microbiologic samplings and examined the literature and disease-transmission principles to evaluate the scientific feasibility of such an association.
Methods
(i) 197 RSCs were sampled for C. difficile at processing facilities; (ii) RSCs were challenged with high C. difficile densities to evaluate efficacy of automated decontamination; and (iii) 50 RSCs and 50 DSCs were sampled in CDI patient rooms in 7 hospitals. Results were coupled with epidemiologic studies, clinical requirements, and chain-of-infection principles, and tests of evidence of disease transmission were applied.
Results
C. difficile spores were found on 9 of 197 (4.6%) RSCs prior to processing. Processing completely removed C. difficile. In CDI patient rooms, 4 of 50 RSCs (8.0%) and 8 of 50 DSCs (16.0%) had sub-infective counts of C. difficile (P = .27). DSCs were in permanent wall cabinets; RSCs were removed and decontaminated frequently.
Conclusion
With C. difficile bioburden being sub-infective on both DSCs and RSCs, sharps containers being no-touch, and glove removal required after sharps disposal, we found 2 links in the chain of infection to be broken and 5 of 7 tests of evidence to be unmet. We conclude that sharps containers pose no risk of C. difficile transmission."

A total of 6350 HH opportunities were recorded; the results were 34.7%, 35%, and 69.7% for hand hygiene complete adherence rate (HHCAR), hand hygiene partial adherence rate (HHPAR), and hand hygiene adherence rate (HHAR), respectively. The HHCAR in the pre-intervention and post-intervention phases were 3% and 70.1%, respectively. HHCAR was highest among nurses (3.6% in the pre-intervention phase and 80.7% in the post-intervention phase). Other findings were that senior physicians had better HH compliance than junior physicians; in the pre-intervention phase, the HHCAR was better in the evening (4.8%); in the post-intervention phase, the HHCAR was better in the morning (72.1%); women had a higher HHCAR than men; and in the pre-intervention phase, good compliance was seen with Moments 2 and 3 of the World Health Organization's (WHO) Five Moments for Hand Hygiene, whereas in the post-intervention phase, good compliance was seen with Moments 3, 4, and 5. Questionnaire-based data were also analyzed to assess KAP of HH. We found that only 55%-82% of HCWs were aware of the WHO's Five Moments for Hand Hygiene. In the post-intervention phase, we observed a significant improvement in KAP of the study group.
Conclusion
Significant improvement in HH compliance can be achieved through a systematic, multidimensional intervention involving all types of HCWs."

abstract = "Background
Infection preventionists (IPs) and registered nurses (RNs) have an important role to play in antibiotic stewardship programs (ASPs). Recent articles highlight their potential roles in practice, research, education, and policy; however, little is known about their actual ASP engagement. Leaders often have early knowledge of emerging trends and evolving health care worker roles.
Methods
A survey was developed using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Core Elements of Hospital Antibiotic Stewardship Programs to assess health care system infection prevention and control leaders' perceptions of IP and RN engagement in hospital ASPs.
Results
Thirty-five leaders representing all regions of the United States completed the survey. Their organizations tended to have significant ASP leadership support, but lacked ASP policies indicating IP and RN roles and responsibilities. IPs were more likely than RNs to be members of the ASP team and have greater ASP knowledge. Neither discipline was conducting patient education related to proper use of antibiotics, but this was identified as a future ASP role. The 2017 Joint Commission Antimicrobial Stewardship Standard was accelerating ASP implementation.
Conclusions
IPs and RNs are well-positioned to assume greater roles in ASPs, especially in educating patients about the safe and proper use of antibiotics. However, their roles must be clearly identified, defined, and quantified. In so doing, knowledge and skill gaps can be identified and specific educational programs developed to advance their successful engagement in ASPs."

abstract = "Background
Patient empowerment is a component of the World Health Organization's multimodal strategy to improve hand hygiene (HH). Its successful implementation requires knowledge of the perceptions and attitudes of patients and health care workers (HCWs) toward patient empowerment in HH.
Methods
A cross-sectional study, through a self-administered questionnaire of patients and their families and HCWs, was conducted in a 433-bed block of an 850-bed university hospital in Galicia, Spain.
Results
A total of 337 patients and their families and 196 HCWs completed the questionnaire. Among patients and their families, 49.9% were willing to remind HCWs about HH. However, only 31.6% of HCWs (41.8% of physicians and 24.8% of nurses) supported patient participation. The most common reason for patients and their families not being willing to ask caregivers to perform HH was fear of causing annoyance or receiving worse treatment as a consequence (76%). The main reasons that physicians disagreed with patient participation was patients’ lack of knowledge (40%) and possible negative effects on the HCW/patient relationship (40%). Nurses considered this participation unnecessary (58%).
Conclusions
There were significant differences between patients and their families and HCWs regarding support for patient empowerment in promoting HH. In our setting, a cultural change is needed in the HCW/patient relationship to create a facilitating environment."

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is the most common antimicrobial-resistant organism identified in Japanese health care facilities. This study analyzed the clinical and economic burdens attributable to methicillin resistance in S aureus in Japanese hospitals.
Methods
We retrospectively investigated data from 14,905 inpatients of 57 hospitals combined with data from nosocomial infection surveillance and administrative claim databases. The participants were inpatients with admission from April 1, 2014, to discharge on March 31, 2016. The outcomes were evaluated according to length of stay, hospital charges, and in-hospital mortality. We compared the disease burden of MRSA infections with methicillin-susceptible S aureus (MSSA) infections based on patients' characteristics and onset periods.
Results
We categorized 7,188 and 7,717 patients into MRSA and MSSA groups, respectively. The adjusted effects of the MRSA group were 1.03-fold (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.05) and 1.04-fold (95% CI, 1.01-1.06), respectively, with an odds ratio of 1.14 (95% CI, 1.02-1.27).

Methods
A case-control study of women who had a lower-segment CD during the study period was performed at Ireland's Cork University Maternity Hospital. Cases were patients who presented to the hospital with SSI and who met the criteria of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Controls were randomly selected from the discharge register of CDs at a ratio of 2:1. Data were extracted from the medical records. A multivariable stepwise logistic regression model approach was used, and the results were expressed as adjusted odds ratios (aORs).
Results
The SSI rate was 2%. The greatest contribution to risk of SSI was associated with maternal obesity (aOR, 4.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.00-11.32) and hypertensive disorders (aOR, 6.67; 95% CI, 1.54-28.99].

Given the changing nature of infection prevention and control (IPC), appropriate infection preventionist (IP) staffing needs to be established. In this study, we aimed to describe current IP staffing levels and IPC department resources in U.S. acute care hospitals.
Methods
These data came from the 2015 MegaSurvey conducted by the Association of Professionals in Infection Prevention and Epidemiology. Descriptive statistics and bivariate analyses were conducted to examine differences in respondent, facility, and department characteristics by facility size (average inpatient census ≤100 vs >100).
Results
Data from 1623 respondents were included. Most (72%) had single-site responsibilities and dedicated 76%-100% of their job to IPC (68%). The overall median IP staffing was 1.25 IPs per 100 inpatient census (interquartile range = 1.81). Almost half (46%) represented facilities with daily inpatient census ≤100; the average number of IPs in these facilities was 1.1 (standard deviation = 0.7). The reported number of IPs increased steadily with higher patient census. Significant differences were observed in IP staffing, responsibilities, and support to the IPC department between smaller and larger hospitals.
Conclusions
This study represents the current snapshot of IP staffing and IPC resources in acute care hospitals. Findings indicate important differences between large and small facilities in staffing and IPC resources. The field of infection prevention would benefit from a comprehensive assessment of IPC department staffing and resource needs."

Antimicrobial wipes are increasingly used in health care settings. This study evaluates, in a clinical setting, the efficacy of sporicidal wipes versus a cloth soaked in a 1,000 ppm chlorine solution.
Intervention
A double-crossover study was performed on 2 different surgical and cardiovascular wards in a 1,000-bed teaching hospital over 29 weeks. The intervention period that consisted of surface decontamination with the preimpregnated wipe or cloth soaked in chlorine followed a 5-week baseline assessment of microbial bioburden on surfaces. Environmental samples from 11 surfaces were analyzed weekly for their microbial content.
Results
A total of 1,566 environmental samples and 1,591 ATP swabs were analyzed during the trial. Overall, there were significant differences in the recovery of total aerobic bacteria (P < .001), total anaerobic bacteria (P < .001), and ATP measurement (P < .001) between wards and between the different parts of the crossover study. Generally, the use of wipes produced the largest reduction in the total aerobic and anaerobic counts when compared with the baseline data or the use of 1,000 ppm chlorine. Collectively, the introduction of training plus daily wipe disinfection significantly reduced multidrug-resistant organisms recovered from surfaces. Reversion to using 1,000 ppm chlorine resulted in the number of sites positive for multidrug-resistant organisms rising again.
Conclusions
This double-crossover study is the first controlled field trial comparison of using preimpregnated wipes versus cotton cloth dipped into a bucket of hypochlorite to decrease surface microbial bioburden. The results demonstrate the superiority of the preimpregnated wipes in significantly decreasing microbial bioburden from high-touch surfaces."

Infection is a leading cause of hospitalization among home healthcare patients. Nurses play an important role in reducing infection among home healthcare patients by complying with infection control procedures. However, few studies have examined the compliance of home healthcare nurses with infection control practices or the range of sociocultural and organizational factors that may be associated with compliance.
Methods
This study analyzed survey responses from nurses at 2 large, certified home healthcare agencies (n = 359), to explore levels of compliance with infection control practices and identify associated demographic, knowledge, and attitudinal correlates.
Results
Nurses reported a high level of infection control compliance (mean = 0.89, standard deviation [SD] = 0.16), correct knowledge (mean = 0.85, SD = 0.09), and favorable attitudes (mean = 0.81, SD = 0.14). Multivariate mixed regression analyses revealed significant positive associations of attitudinal scores with reported level of compliance (P < .001). However, knowledge of inflection control practices was not associated with compliance. Older (P < .05) and non-Hispanic black (P < .001) nurses reported higher compliance with infection control practices than younger and white non-Hispanic nurses.
Conclusion
These findings suggest that efforts to improve compliance with infection control practices in home healthcare should focus on strategies to alter perceptions about infection risk and other attitudinal factors."

The intensive care unit (ICU) is considered the epicenter of infections, and patients in the ICU are at higher risk of infection because of their vulnerability, age, and lengthy hospitalization.
Methods
The ethnographic design has been used to describe, examine, and evaluate the policies and procedures that are implemented to prevent and control hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) in the medical ICU in King Abdullah University Hospital. In-depth semi-structured interviews with 23 participants supported by nonparticipant observation and document analysis were carried out to collect triangulated data. The themes and subthemes were developed through a software package and hand-coding procedure.
Results
Health care workers were aware but not fully engaged to prevent and control HAIs; nevertheless, they presented themselves as knowledgeable. Staff recognized the importance of involving family members and visitors. However, they had serious concern toward open visitation. The nurse to patient ratio was another challenge of infection prevention and control practices. The findings demonstrated that performing continuous prospective surveillance by highly qualified and trained staff can reduce the risk of endemic HAIs.
Conclusions
The study highlighted the importance of changing behaviors and practices of health care providers and visitors to improve adherence to infection prevention and control policies and practices."

The risk of occupational transmission of bloodborne pathogens to health care workers is primarily associated with needlestick and sharps injuries (NSIs). However, most NSIs are not reported, and most health care workers are not aware of postexposure procedures.
Methods
Data for NSIs reported in our hospital between 2008 and 2016 were reviewed retrospectively.
Results
A total of 546 staff members reported NSIs. Of these, 376 (68.9%) were women. NSIs were more commonly reported by trainee nurses (243 [44.5%]), followed by nurses (121 [22.2%]), cleaning staff (108 [19.8%]), and doctors (49 [9%]). The rate of postexposure interventions was 13% in 2008 and 92.6% in 2016 (P < .0001; χ2 = 82.866). NSI rates also show that the number of applications with NSIs increased over the years. When occupational blood exposure was examined, the number of bloodborne pathogens was 50 (9.3%) cases of hepatitis B virus, 30 (5.6%) cases of hepatitis C virus, 3 cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, 1 case of HIV, and 2 cases of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus coinfection.
Discussion
Over the years, the increase in both the appropriate intervention rate and the number of reports to the hospital infection control committee after NSIs shows that regular training regarding NSIs is effective.
Conclusions
Hospital infection control committees may play a more active role in raising awareness in this regard and thus reducing the rate of unreported NSIs."

In the intensive care unit (ICU), catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is the most common urinary tract infection. Nevertheless, there is no systematic review to investigate the epidemiology of pathogens and antimicrobial resistance of CAUTIs in ICUs.
Methods
Eight electronic databases were searched for eligible studies. A meta-analysis was performed to calculate the CAUTI incidence per 1,000 catheter days, the proportion of pathogen distribution, and the resistance rate with R3.3.2 software.
Results
Seventy-five studies were included. The total weighted CAUTI incidence per 1,000 catheter days was 7.78. Gram-negative bacteria (47.46%), fungi (27.81%), and gram-positive bacteria (19.06%) were isolated. Candida spp (27.4%), Escherichia spp (23.41%), and Enterococcus spp (15.0%) were the most frequent pathogens. Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Candida glabrata were generally resistant to itraconazole, with resistance rates of 42.5%, 53.0%, and 59.7%, respectively. Escherichia spp displayed high rates of resistance to ampicillin (87.3%), ciprofloxacin (71.7%), and norfloxacin (71.2%). Enterococcus spp showed high rates of resistance to erythromycin (83.9%), penicillin (76.7%), and levofloxacin (73.8%).
Conclusions
In ICUs, the CAUTI incidence per 1,000 catheter days is high. CAUTIs were mainly caused by gram-negative bacteria that were resistant to common antibiotics. There is a pressing demand for future research into CAUTI, including effective prevention, an understanding of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms, and development of new antibiotics for patient safety."

Improper infection prevention practice associated with ultrasound probe use has been linked to increased infection risk, outbreaks, and death. Although guidelines for reprocessing and use of probes exist, it is unclear how extensively these have been adopted in practice.
Methods
Infection preventionists from U.S. health care facilities were surveyed (N = 358). The anonymous survey had 31 multiple choice, sliding scale, and text response questions. The survey was developed and deployed and the data were stored in the REDCap system.
Results
A high degree of noncompliance with U.S. guidelines was identified. Surface probes used in invasive procedures were not high-level disinfected or sterilized 15% (intraoperative) to 78% (peripheral line placements) of the time. Of invasive procedures, 5%-47% did not use sterile gel (same procedures, respectively). Of the participants, 20% were aware of instances where an ultrasound probe was used but was not correctly reprocessed. Extensive breaches of infection control guidelines were reported. The rapid expansion in use of ultrasound has brought clinical benefit but may be exposing patients to preventable infection risk.
Conclusions
Infection preventionists are well placed to act as major drivers of change based on their expertise and experience in the management of infection risk across facilities and health systems. They, along with clinicians responsible for probe use and reprocessing, should review practices relating to ultrasound in their facilities. Where practice does not comply with guidelines, policy and training should be updated to ensure patient safety."

Fear surrounds Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) because it is highly infectious. Yet members of the Serious Communicable Diseases Unit (SCDU) at Emory University Hospital (EUH) had to overcome that fear when caring for patients with EVD.
Purpose
The analysis reported here illustrates how the members of EUH's SCDU tacitly enacted high reliability (HR) principles while caring for patients with EVD.
Methods
A qualitative study was conducted to describe the experience of members of the EUH SCDU who worked with EVD patients in 2014. We completed 17 semi-structured interviews involving registered nurses, physicians, and support personnel (eg, laboratory technicians). Interview recordings were transcribed and analyzed using conventional content analysis. Exploring HR principles was not among the questions guiding this exploration, but the participants repeatedly described concepts related to HR.
Results
The goal of the SCDU team was to save patients' lives while protecting their own lives. Rigorous training and meeting high standards were required to make the team. The fear surrounding EVD set in motion the enactment of HR principles. HR principles served to alleviate failures or breakdowns in infection prevention and control, thus keeping patients and staff safe.
Conclusions
These findings illustrate that it is possible to move HR principles from theory to practice in high-risk situations. HR principles were essential to safety and to infection prevention and control."

abstract = "Background
Ensuring aseptic airborne environments for sterile fields and back instrument tables in operating rooms (ORs) is crucial to reducing microbial and particle contamination during surgery. Configurations of in-ceiling air delivery mechanisms impact the effectiveness of the system at eliminating contamination in critical zones.
Methods
The environmental quality indicator method was used to assess airborne environments in ORs equipped with a single large diffuser (SLD), a multidiffuser array (MDA), or a 4-way throw diffuser during dynamic, simulated surgical procedures. Environmental quality indicators measured included particles, microbes, carbon dioxide, velocity, humidity, and temperature at 26 air changes per hour.
Results
SLD ORs performed better than MDA ORs and 4-way throw diffuser ORs at removing microbes and carbon dioxide from the sterile field (P < .05). SLD ORs had higher velocity and lower temperature over the sterile field than the other 2 ORs (P < .05). MDA ORs had lower total particle counts than the other ORs (P < .05). The sterile fields in all ORs were cleaner than the respective back instrument tables (P < .05).
Conclusions
Air delivery systems that eliminate blockages to uniform airflow directly over sterile zones, such as boom mounts and access panels, and deliver unidirectional, downward flow of clean filtered air provided a cleaner airborne environment within the sterile field.

The study objective was to identify potential sociodemographic disparities in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection screening among Baby Boomers in the United States.
Methods
We analyzed cross-sectional data from the 2013-2016 National Health Interview Survey. The outcome was whether a person had an HCV infection screening (yes/no). Key independent variables were race/ethnicity, geographic region, poverty level, education level, and health insurance status. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to examine the factors associated with the receipt of HCV screening.
Results
The study sample included a total of 41,914 United States Baby Boomers, who represented a population size of 69,554,339. In 2016, the HCV screening rate among Baby Boomers was 13.9%. In the multivariate logistic regression, we found that Asians had 27% lower odds of receiving an HCV screening compared to Blacks (odds ratio [OR] = 0.74, P = .02). People who lived in the Northeast, South, and West had a higher likelihood of having an HCV screening than those who lived in the Midwest (OR = 1.33, 1.39, and 1.69, respectively; all P values <.001). Additionally, people with less education, lower income, and private health insurance were significantly less likely to have an HCV screening.
Conclusion
Future studies or interventions are needed to target these disadvantaged populations to improve HCV screening in Baby Boomers."

Simulation health care education is widely used in medical education and has great potential. However, scenario-based simulation health care education for preventing health care–associated infections has not been described.
Methods
A single-center, prospective cohort study was conducted at Tokyo Medical University Hospital (1,015 beds), an acute care teaching hospital, from January 2011 to December 2014. Each training course was held every month and lasted 2 hours. Trainees put on and removed personal protective equipment under scenarios of standard precaution (2 scenarios) and contact precaution with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (1 scenario), while considering the timing of hand hygiene. We determined the correlations between the participation rate in the simulation education and the use of alcohol-based hand disinfection and reduction of catheter-related bloodstream infection.
Results
There were 1,077 trainees. The total participation rate for hospital staff, which increased gradually during the study period, was 76% by the end of the study. The overall correlation between the use of alcohol-based hand disinfection in the hospital and the course participation rate was significant (correlation coefficient, 0.97). An inverse correlation (−0.94) was observed for the relation between the training course participation rate and the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infection.
Conclusions
Our training course had a positive effect on hand hygiene. This study is the first effective scenario-based simulation health care education on hand hygiene and control of health care–associated infection."

Using adenosine triphosphate (ATP) tests to assess manual cleaning of gastroscopes and to determine the associated workload in a busy endoscopy unit.
Methods
Patient-used gastroscopes were sampled before and after cleaning to assess ATP levels, bioburden, and protein. Samples were collected by flushing 20 mL of sterile water through the biopsy port to the distal end. Time spent for reprocessing and performing the ATP test was recorded.
Results
Twenty-four samples were collected from 10 gastroscopes. After manual cleaning, 14/24 (58.3%) samples had no microbial growth (mean, 21 colony-forming units/cm2), and in 22/24 (91.7%) samples the protein was undetectable (mean, 0.04 µg/cm2). ATP test was above the cutoff (200 relative light units [RLU]) in 17/24 (70.8%) samples (mean, 498 RLU). After the second cleaning, 11/17 (64.7%) gastroscopes still failed the ATP test (mean, 321.2 RLU). The mean time spent to perform manual cleaning and ATP tests was 16 and 8 minutes, respectively. Hence, each test increased the length of time for cleaning plus testing cleanliness by 50%.
Conclusion
Further studies regarding the optimal cutoff for ATP tests are needed. ATP tests for cleaning monitoring are easy to perform and provide immediate feedback to the team. However, the increased workload needs to be considered."

Provider-entered indications for antibiotics have been recommended as a tracking tool for antibiotic stewardship programs. The accuracy and utility of these indications are unknown.
Methods
Drug-specific lists of evidence-based indications were integrated into an electronic health system as an ordering hard-stop. We reviewed antibiotic orders with provider-entered indications to determine whether the chosen indication matched the documentation and whether antibiotic use was appropriate.
Results
One hundred fifty-five antibiotic orders were reviewed. Clinical documentation supported the entered indication in 80% of vancomycin orders, 78% of cefepime orders, and 74% of fluoroquinolone orders. The clinical appropriateness for vancomycin, cefepime, and fluoroquinolones were 94%, 100%, and 68%, respectively. When providers chose indications from the list as opposed to choosing “other” and entering free text, antibiotic orders were significantly more likely to be appropriate (odds ratio, 5.8; P = .001) but also less likely to match clinical documentation (odds ratio, 0.25; P = .0043).
Discussion
Provider-chosen indications are, overall, an accurate reflection of the true reason for antibiotic use at our institution. Providers frequently documented reasons for fluoroquinolone use that were not among the provided indications.
Conclusion
Selecting an indication from an evidence-based list as opposed to free-text indications increases the odds that antibiotic agents will be used appropriately."

Outbreaks of health care–associated infections (HAIs) caused by Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) have been associated with medical devices and water-based products. Water is the most common raw ingredient in nonsterile liquid drugs, and the significance of organisms recovered from microbiologic testing during manufacturing is assessed using a risk-based approach. This incident demonstrates that lapses in manufacturing practices and quality control of nonsterile liquid drugs can have serious unintended consequences.
Methods
An epidemiologic and laboratory investigation of clusters of Bcc HAIs that occurred among critically ill, hospitalized, adult and pediatric patients was performed between January 1, 2016, and October 31, 2016.
Results
One hundred and eight case patients with Bcc infections at a variety of body sites were identified in 12 states. Two distinct strains of Bcc were obtained from patient clinical cultures. These strains were found to be indistinguishable or closely related to 2 strains of Bcc obtained from cultures of water used in the production of liquid docusate, and product that had been released to the market by manufacturer X.
Conclusions
This investigation highlights the ability of bacteria present in nonsterile, liquid drugs to cause infections or colonization among susceptible patients. Prompt reporting and thorough investigation of potentially related infections may assist public health officials in identifying and removing contaminated products from the market when lapses in manufacturing occur."

Methods
The program implemented involved establishment of prevention guidelines, hand-hygiene promotion, isolation of patients colonized or infected by such organisms, enforced contact precautions, and terminal cleaning and disinfection of isolation rooms. A microbiology service, previously provided by an external laboratory, was established in the hospital. Detection of bacteria-resistant genes and molecular typing were performed also.
Results
Statistically significant differences were observed between the pre- and post-intervention periods (P = .00198). Control measures were effective in blocking the dissemination of a previously endemic clone of Acinetobacter baumannii. Changes were observed in the dissemination pattern, from a monoclonal to a polyclonal mode. The incidence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus during the surveillance period was low. Only 2 isolates of BLAKPC-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae (distinct profiles), and 5 isolates of BLASPM-positive Pseudomonas aeruginosa (a single cluster), were detected.

All Ontario hospitals are mandated to self-report vancomycin-resistant enterocococi (VRE) bacteremias to Ontario's Ministry of Health and Long-term Care for public reporting purposes. Independent quarterly audits of publicly reported VRE bacteremias between September 2013 and June 2015 were carried out by Public Health Ontario. VRE bacteremia case-reporting errors between January 2009 and August 2013 were identified by a single retrospective audit.
Methods
Employing a quasiexperimental pre–post study design, the relative risk of VRE bacteremia reporting errors before and after quarterly audits were modeled using Poisson regression adjusting for hospital type, case counts reported to the Ministry of Health and Long-term Care, and autocorrelation via generalized estimating equation.
Results
Overall, 24.5% (126 out of 514) of VRE bacteremias were reported in error; 114 out of 367 (31%) VRE bacteremias reported before quarterly audits and 12 out of 147 (8.1%) reported after audits were found to be incorrect. In adjusted analysis, quarterly audits of VRE bacteremias were associated with significant reductions in reporting errors when compared with before quarterly auditing (relative risk, 0.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-0.63). Risk of reporting errors among community hospitals were greater than acute teaching hospitals of the region (relative risk, 4.39; 95% CI, 3.07-5.70).
Conclusions
This study found independent quarterly audits of publicly reported VRE bacteremias to be associated with significant reductions in reporting errors. Public reporting systems should consider adopting routine data audits and hospital-targeted training to improve data accuracy."

Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) contribute to increased morbidity, length of hospital stay, and cost. Despite progress in understanding the risk factors, there remains a need to accurately predict the risk of CLABSIs and, in real time, prevent them from occurring.
Methods
A predictive model was developed using retrospective data from a large academic healthcare system. Models were developed with machine learning via construction of random forests using validated input variables.
Results
Fifteen variables accounted for the most significant effect on CLABSI prediction based on a retrospective study of 70,218 unique patient encounters between January 1, 2013, and May 31, 2016. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the best-performing model was 0.82 in production.
Discussion
This model has multiple applications for resource allocation for CLABSI prevention, including serving as a tool to target patients at highest risk for potentially cost-effective but otherwise time-limited interventions.

Routine hand hygiene effectively removes methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and/or vancomycin resistant Enterococcus (VRE) from the ungloved hands of healthcare workers (HCWs) who are caring for patients under contact precautions, when exposure to bodily fluids is not expected.
Methods
HCWs' ungloved hands were cultured after hand hygiene with alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) or soap-and-water wash after routine clinical care of patients known to be colonized or infected with MRSA or VRE.
Results
Two hundred forty samples from 40 HCWs were tested and found to be culture negative for either MRSA or VRE after contact with patients when 3 pumps of ABHR (0/80) or plain soap-and-water wash (0/80) were used. No VRE was observed in any of the 120 samples collected. Two plates (2/40) grew 1 colony-forming unit of MRSA after 2 pumps of ABHR. Two HCWs with positive plates were cultured negative on retesting.
Conclusion
We showed that appropriate hand hygiene was effective in removing MRSA and VRE even when gloves were not used for routine clinical care, despite contact with patients known to be colonized with MRSA or VRE. A modified approach to glove use for dry contact with patients on contact precautions might improve patient safety within healthcare settings."

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important nosocomial pathogen that commonly colonizes hospital water supplies, including in taps and sinks. We report the transmission of P. aeruginosa from water to patients in a clinical hematology setting.
Methods
P. aeruginosa from water samples were compared to clinical isolates from hematology ward patients, via molecular typing (pulsed field gel electrophoresis).
Results
P. aeruginosa cultured from blood cultures from 3 patients was indistinguishable from water strains, by molecular typing. Based on infection control inspections, the transmission event was surmised to be due to cleaning of equipment, specifically an infusion therapy procedure tray used to transport intravenous drugs to patients, with water from an outlet colonized by P. aeruginosa.
Conclusion
We show the importance of holistic factors, such as disposal of patient waste water, cleaning of tap outlets, and cleaning of medical equipment, in the transmission of P. aeruginosa, and demonstrate that the role of waterborne transmission of this organism in a hematology setting cannot be overlooked. We suggest that appropriate management of water, including both holistic and engineering interventions, is needed to stop transmission of P. aeruginosa from water to patients."

Inadequate environmental disinfection represents a serious risk for health care–associated infections. Technologic advancements in disinfection practices, including no-touch devices, offer significant promise to improve infection control. We evaluated one such device, portable pulsed xenon ultraviolet (PX-UV) units, on microbial burden during an implementation trial across 4 Veterans Affairs hospitals.
Methods
Environmental samples were collected before and after terminal room cleaning: 2 facilities incorporated PX-UV disinfection into their cleaning protocols and 2 practiced manual disinfection only. Specimens from 5 high-touch surfaces were collected from rooms harboring methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or aerobic bacteria colonies (ABC). Unadjusted pre-post count reductions and negative binomial regression modeled PX-UV versus manual cleaning alone.
Results
Seventy samples were collected. Overall, PX-UV reduced MRSA and ABC counts by 75.3% and 84.1%, respectively, versus only 25%-30% at control sites. Adjusting for baseline counts, manually cleaned rooms had significantly higher residual levels than PX-UV sites. Combined analyses revealed an incident rate ratio of 5.32 (P = .0024), with bedrails, tray tables, and toilet handrails also showing statistically superior PX-UV disinfection.
Conclusions
This multicenter study demonstrates significantly reduced disinfection across several common pathogens in facilities using PX-UV devices. Clinical impact of laboratory reductions on infection rates was not assessed, representing a critical future research question. However, such approaches to routine cleaning suggest a practical strategy when integrated into daily hospital operations."

This paper goes beyond detecting specific themes within Zika-related chatter on Twitter, to identify the key actors who influence the diffusive process through which some themes become more amplified than others.
Methods
We collected all Zika-related tweets during the 3 months immediately after the first U.S. case of Zika. After the tweets were categorized into 12 themes, a cross-section were grouped into weekly datasets, to capture 12 amplifier/user groups, and analyzed by 4 amplification modes: mentions, retweets, talkers, and Twitter-wide amplifiers.
Results
We analyzed 3,057,130 tweets in the United States and categorized 4997 users. The most talked about theme was Zika transmission (~58%). News media, public health institutions, and grassroots users were the most visible and frequent sources and disseminators of Zika-related Twitter content. Grassroots users were the primary sources and disseminators of conspiracy theories.

Effective hospital-wide antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programs need multidisciplinary engagement; however, clinicians' attitudes have not been investigated in Thailand where AMS is in early development. The aim of this study was to explore Thai clinicians' (doctors, nurses, and pharmacists) perceptions and attitudes toward AMS.
Methods
A paper-based survey was distributed in a 1,000-bed university hospital in Bangkok, Thailand, between November 9, 2015, and December 21, 2015. A total of 1,087 clinicians participated: 392 doctors, 613 nurses, and 82 pharmacists.
Results
Most participants agreed that improving antimicrobial prescribing would decrease antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and should be a priority of hospital policy. Doctors were less likely to agree with policies that limit antimicrobial prescribing (P < .001) than nurses or pharmacists, and were less likely to be interested in participating in AMS education than other clinicians (P < .001). Pharmacists indicated higher agreement with the statement, recommending that a specialist team provide individualized antimicrobial prescribing advice (P < .01) and that feedback improves antimicrobial selection (P < .001). Nurses were less likely to agree that community antibiotic use (P < .001) or patient pressure for antibiotics contribute to AMR (P < .001).

abstract = "Background
Urinary tract infection (UTI) is thought to be a common complication of stroke and is regarded as a potential risk factor for poor stroke outcomes. However, there is a controversy among predictive factors of stroke-associated UTIs. We aim to estimate the prevalence and predisposing factors of UTIs among patients with stroke.
Methods
PubMed, EMBASE, and Elsevier Science Direct were searched by 2 independent researchers. Sixteen studies with a total of 13,513 patients were included to evaluate the prevalence and predictive factors of stroke-associated UTIs published from the earliest records to March 10, 2017. Pooled effect sizes were calculated using the fixed effect model or random effect model according to I2 and P values.
Results
The pooled prevalence of UTI was 19.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 15%-22%; P < .01). The predisposing factors for UTIs include female sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.93; 95% CI, 1.55-2.41), older age (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.09-1.50), higher modified Rankin Scale score (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.43-2.53), and postvoid residual volume >100 mL (OR, 3.69; 95% CI, 2.09-6.52).
Conclusions
Approximately one-fifth of patients with stroke contracted at least 1 UTI after cerebral apoplexy. Female sex, older age, higher modified Rankin Scale score, and postvoid residual volume >100 mL were associated with higher risk of UTI."

Strict adherence to each step of reprocessing is imperative to removing potentially infectious agents. Multiple methods for verifying proper reprocessing exist; however, each presents challenges and limitations, and best practice within the industry has not been established. Our goal was to evaluate endoscope cleaning verification tests with particular interest in the evaluation of the manual cleaning step. The results of the cleaning verification tests were compared with microbial culturing to see if a positive cleaning verification test would be predictive of microbial growth.
Methods
This study was conducted at 2 high-volume endoscopy units within a multisite health care system. Each of the 90 endoscopes were tested for adenosine triphosphate, protein, microbial growth via agar plate, and rapid gram-negative culture via assay. The endoscopes were tested in 3 locations: the instrument channel, control knob, and elevator mechanism.
Results
This analysis showed substantial level of agreement between protein detection postmanual cleaning and protein detection post–high-level disinfection at the control head for scopes sampled sequentially.
Conclusions
This study suggests that if protein is detected postmanual cleaning, there is a significant likelihood that protein will also be detected post–high-level disinfection. It also infers that a cleaning verification test is not predictive of microbial growth."

To analyze the impact of the International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC) multidimensional approach (IMA) on ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) rates in 11 hospitals within 5 cities of Argentina from January 2014-April 2017.
Methods
A multicenter, prospective, before–after surveillance study was conducted through the use of International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium Surveillance Online System. During baseline, we performed outcome surveillance of VAP applying the definitions of the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention's National Healthcare Safety Network. During intervention, we implemented the IMA, which included a bundle of infection prevention practice interventions, education, outcome surveillance, process surveillance, feedback on VAP rates and consequences, and performance feedback of process surveillance. Bivariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed using a logistic regression model to estimate the effect of the intervention.
Results
We recorded 3,940 patients admitted to 14 intensive care units. At baseline, there were 19.9 VAPs per 1,000 mechanical ventilator (MV)-days—with 2,920 MV-days and 58 VAPs, which was reduced during intervention to 9.4 VAPs per 1,000 MV-days—with 9,261 MV-days and 103 VAPs. This accounted for a 52% rate reduction (incidence density rate, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-0.7; P .001).
Conclusions
Implementing the IMA was associated with significant reductions in VAP rates in intensive care units within Argentina."

We hypothesized that the addition of a novel verbal electronic audio reminder to an educational patient hand hygiene bundle would increase performance of self-managed patient hand hygiene.
Methods
We conducted a 2-group comparative effectiveness study randomly assigning participants to patient hand hygiene bundle 1 (n = 41), which included a video, a handout, and a personalized verbal electronic audio reminder (EAR) that prompted hand cleansing at 3 meal times, or patient hand hygiene bundle 2 (n = 34), which included the identical video and handout, but not the EAR. The primary outcome was alcohol-based hand sanitizer use based on weighing bottles of hand sanitizer.
Results
Participants that received the EAR averaged significantly more use of hand sanitizer product over the 3 days of the study (mean ± SD, 29.97 ± 17.13 g) than participants with no EAR (mean ± SD, 10.88 ± 9.27 g; t73 = 5.822; P ≤ .001).
Conclusions
The addition of a novel verbal EAR to a patient hand hygiene bundle resulted in a significant increase in patient hand hygiene performance. Our results suggest that simple audio technology can be used to improve patient self-management of hand hygiene. Future research is needed to determine if the technology can be used to promote other healthy behaviors, reduce infections, and improve patient-centered care without increasing the workload of health care workers."

Newborns are suctioned with a blue bulb manual suction device to remove naso-oropharyngeal secretions and promote airway clearance. This study identifies and discusses the microbial profile and characterization of the bulb used in newborns on intrapartum and postpartum units.
Methods
This was a descriptive study with convenience sampling of a total of 50 bulbs used in cesarean births, vaginal births, and on the postpartum unit. The bulbs were tested for microbial growth, and the percentages of contaminated bulbs were calculated. The χ2 test was used to compare the proportion of bulbs with microbial growth by route of birth among bulbs sampled from the intrapartum unit.
Results
Microbial profile and characterization identified a total of 57 different gram-positive cocci and rods and gram-negative rods. Among 50 bulbs cultured, bacterial growth was present in 42% of the bulbs, and Escherichia coli was identified in 55% of the gram-negative rod isolates. The χ2 test comparing vaginal and cesarean bulbs showed a statistically significant difference in the percentages of contaminated bulbs for any growth (P = .023) and for any Staphylococcus spp (P = .050).
Conclusions
New empirical evidence confirms the bulb is a potential bacterial reservoir and poses a potential health risk for nosocomial infections for newborns. Further studies are needed to identify bacterial transmission, newborn outcomes, bactericidal bulb cleaning methods, and quality and safe suction practices."

The implementation of the core components of infection prevention and control (IPC) recommended by the World Health Organization faces severe challenges, particularly in developing countries. Given that hospital IPC committees in these countries are the key implementers of IPC, there is a need to evaluate their effectiveness. This study qualitatively evaluated the effectiveness of IPC committees in the southern African country of Lesotho with the aim of identifying themes for policy discourse on improving IPC practice in the country.
Methods
Data gathering was conducted through open interviews with purposefully selected key informant IPC committee members and relevant officials at the Ministry of Health, whereas data analysis was based on grounded theory.
Results
Despite their commitment, IPC committees were largely ineffective because of 5 major barriers, namely poor sense of competence, administrative constraints, inadequate financial support, role uncertainty, and negative staff attitudes. Poor IPC governance was found to be a central barrier to the effectiveness of IPC committees in Lesotho.
Conclusions
The import of this study is that effective IPC governance is key to improving the IPC program in Lesotho. Effective leadership with the necessary competencies is needed to steer the IPC program in the country."

Surgical site infections after joint arthroplasty are devastating complications and are influenced by patient, surgical, and operating room environmental factors.
Methods
In an effort to reduce the incidence of door openings (DOs) during total joint arthroplasty cases, this prospective observational study consisted of 3 phases. Phase 1 determined the baseline incidence of DOs, followed by installation of a mechanical door counter (phase 2). Finally, an educational seminar was presented to all personnel (phase 3) regarding the implications frequent DOs have on patient and surgical outcomes.
Results
The average openings per case (OPC) for each of the 3 phases were 33.5, 34.2, and 27.7, respectively. There was a 17% reduction in OPC between phases 1 and 3 (P = .02). There were no significant differences between knee and hip arthroplasty cases during the 3 phases (P = .21, P = .46, and P = .81, respectively). There was a strong correlation between length of surgery and OPC, with a Pearson coefficient of r = 0.87 during phase 3. To account for differences in average operative time between phases, data were normalized for the length of surgery with the ratio of door openings per minute determined (0.36, 0.34, and 0.32 for each phase, respectively).
Conclusions
We were able to show that simply monitoring door openings during joint arthroplasty was not effective in reducing the occurrences. However, after a novel educational seminar given to all personnel, we were able to significantly reduce the incidence of operating room door openings, reducing a potential risk factor for surgical site infections."

Isolation gowns serve a critical role in infection control by protecting healthcare workers, visitors, and patients from the transfer of microorganisms and body fluids. The decision of whether to use a reusable or disposable garment system is a selection process based on factors including sustainability, barrier effectiveness, cost, and comfort. Environmental sustainability is increasingly being used in the decision-making process. Life cycle assessment is the most comprehensive and widely used tool used to evaluate environmental performance.
Methods
The environmental impacts of market-representative reusable and disposable isolation gown systems were compared using standard life cycle assessment procedures. The basis of comparison was 1,000 isolation gown uses in a healthcare setting. The scope included the manufacture, use, and end-of-life stages of the gown systems.
Results
At the healthcare facility, compared to the disposable gown system, the reusable gown system showed a 28% reduction in energy consumption, a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, a 41% reduction in blue water consumption, and a 93% reduction in solid waste generation.
Conclusions
Selecting reusable garment systems may result in significant environmental benefits compared to selecting disposable garment systems. By selecting reusable isolation gowns, healthcare facilities can add these quantitative benefits directly to their sustainability scorecards."

Since hospital patient privacy curtains can harbor bacteria, are high-touch surfaces, and are cleaned infrequently, they may be involved in pathogen transmission. The aim of this longitudinal prospective study was to understand curtain contamination to inform curtain hygiene protocols, thereby minimizing the role of curtains in pathogen transmission.
Methods
Over 21 days, cultures of 10 freshly laundered curtains (8 test curtains surrounding patient beds and 2 controls in an unoccupied staff room) were taken in the Regional Burns/Plastics Unit. Contact plates were used to sample the curtains near the edge hem where they are most frequently touched. Microbial contamination and the presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were determined.
Results
By day 3, test curtains showed increased microbial contamination (mean colony-forming units [CFU]/cm2 = 1.17) compared to control curtains (mean CFU/cm2 = 0.19). Test curtains became increasingly contaminated over time, with mean CFU/cm2 for days 17 and 21 of 1.86 and 5.11, respectively. By day 10, 1/8 test curtains tested positive for MRSA, and 5/8 were positive by day 14.
Conclusions
Patient privacy curtains became progressively contaminated with bacteria, including MRSA. Between days 10 and 14 after being hung, curtains showed increased MRSA positivity. This may represent an opportune time to intervene, either by cleaning or replacing the curtains."

A national surveillance system for health care-associated infections (HAIs) in Iran is relatively new, and an update on incidence and mortality rates can aid clinicians and stakeholders in development of new guidelines and imperative modifications to be made.
Methods
Data were extracted from the national HAIs surveillance software for more than 7 million hospitalizations during 2015. Data regarding age, gender, deaths, ward of admission, and microbiologic findings were collected and analyzed.
Results
From 491 hospitals, 7,018,393 hospitalizations were reported during 2015; 82,950 patients had been diagnosed with at least 1 HAI, 6,355 of whom died (crude fatality rate, 7.7). Men comprised 51.4% of the patients. The incidence rate was calculated to be 1.18. Urinary tract infections and pneumonia were the most commonly reported infections (27.9% and 23.8%) and 33% of patients were older than age 65 years. Intensive care units had the highest incidence rates, followed by burn units with incidence rates close to 9. Highest percentages of deaths were reported among patients with an HAI in the intensive care unit (20.6%) and those with pneumonia (39.6%).
Conclusion
Although the underreporting of HAIs hinders accurate calculation of incidence, the present study provides a general update. The results can help in modification of national guidelines and appropriate choice of antimicrobial agents in the management of HAIs."

Monitoring results showing poor hand hygiene compliance in a major, busy emergency department prompted a quality improvement initiative to improve hand hygiene compliance.
Purpose
To identify, remove, and reduce barriers to hand hygiene compliance in an emergency department.
Methods
A barrier identification tool was used to identify key barriers and opportunities associated with hand hygiene compliance. Hand hygiene imperatives were developed and agreed on with clinicians, and a framework for monitoring and improving hand hygiene compliance was developed.
Results
Barriers to compliance were ambiguity about when to clean hands, the pace and urgency of work in some areas of the department, which left little time for hand hygiene and environmental and operational issues. Sore hands were a problem for some staff. Expectations of compliance were agreed on with staff, and changes were made to remove barriers. A monitoring tool was designed to monitor progress. Gradual improvement occurred in all areas, except in emergency situations, which require further improvement work.
Conclusions
The context of care and barriers to compliance should be reflected in hand hygiene expectations and monitoring. In the emergency department, the requirement to deliver urgent live-saving care can supersede conventional hand hygiene expectations."

A qualitative study was performed in 33 Thai hospitals. The information from focus group discussions with 39 nurses and face-to-face, in-depth interviews with 50 surgical personnel was analyzed using content analysis.
Results
Major barriers were an unclear policy, inadequate personnel, refusals and resistance from the surgical team, English/electronic SSC, and foreign patients. The key strategies to improve SSC implementation were found to be policy management, training using role-play and station-based deconstruction, adapting SSC implementation suitable for the hospital's context, building self-awareness, and patient involvement.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the most common healthcare-associated gastrointestinal infection. Hospitals are required to report cases of healthcare facility-onset CDI (HO-CDI) using the National Healthcare Safety Network's CDI laboratory-identified (LabID) event definition. The aim of this study was to determine the extent of potential over-reporting due to the exclusion of important clinical data within LabID reporting definitions.
Methods
In 2015, retrospective chart review was performed on 212 HO-CDI cases reported from a large urban medical center. Cases had positive polymerase chain reaction test for the C. difficile toxin B gene from an unformed stool specimen collected >3 days after admission and >8 weeks after most recent LabID event. Cases were categorized into “clinical surveillance” groups: community-acquired infection, recurrence/relapse, asymptomatic colonization, colonization with self-limited symptoms, possible HO-CDI, and probable HO-CDI.
Results
Of the infections, 13.6% were community acquired, 2.8% were recurrent/relapse, 1.9% were asymptomatic colonization, 18.4% were symptomatic colonization, 38.7% were possible HO-CDI, and 24.5% were probable HO-CDI. Within 24 hours of testing, 34.1% of patients had received a stool softener and/or laxative.
Conclusions
Laxative use and failure to identify community-onset infection may contribute to misclassification of HO-CDI. Only 62% of reported cases met clinical surveillance criteria."

abstract = "Objective
To describe a polymicrobial fungal outbreak after Hurricane Sandy.
Design
An observational concurrent outbreak investigation and retrospective descriptive review.
Setting
A regional burn intensive care unit that serves the greater Baltimore area, admitting 350-450 burn patients annually.
Patients
Patients with burn injuries and significant dermatologic diseases such as toxic epidermal necrolysis who were admitted to the burn intensive care unit.
Methods
An outbreak investigation and a retrospective review of all patients with non-candida fungal isolates from 2009-2016 were performed.
Results
A polymicrobial fungal outbreak in burn patients was temporally associated with Hurricane Sandy and associated with air and water permeations in the hospital facility. The outbreak abated after changes to facility design.
Conclusions
Our results suggest a possible association between severe weather events like hurricanes and nosocomial fungal outbreaks. This report adds to the emerging literature on the effect of severe weather on healthcare-associated infections."

At present, the shortest recommended application time of alcoholic handrubs is an application interval of 30 seconds. However, application times shorter than 30 seconds are regularly practiced. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether a 15-second application time achieves a comparable wettability of hands to a 30-second handrub application.
Setting
The wettability of 20 healthy volunteers' hands was compared after 15 seconds or 30 seconds of application time of an ultraviolet-light–active handrub, both before and after training in the application technique. Images of the ventral side and dorsal side of the hands were evaluated by computer software. Both groups' outcomes were analyzed with regard to the spread of the handrub on hands.
Results
There was no difference between the wetted areas of the hands after 15 seconds or 30 seconds of handrub application. A significant difference was observed between the wetted areas of hands in trained volunteers compared with untrained volunteers, irrespective of application time.
Conclusion
Based on our results, a 15-second application time is equal to 30-second application time in terms of wettability of hands. The improvement of wettability after training underlines the necessity to instruct new and untrained health care workers in hand antisepsis. Using fluorescent handrubs may be a feasible method to control and retrain hand hygiene techniques of long-time employees."

There is limited research on the importance of implementation when evaluating the effect of hand hygiene interventions in school settings in developed countries. The aim of this study was to examine the association between an implementation index and the effect of the intervention. The Hi Five Intervention was evaluated in a 3-armed cluster randomized controlled trial involving 43 randomly selected Danish schools.
Methods
Analyses investigating the association between implementation of the Hi Five Intervention and infectious illness days, infectious illness episodes, illness-related absenteeism, and hand hygiene were carried out in a multilevel model (school, class, and child).
Results
The level of implementation was associated with hand hygiene and potentially associated with number of infectious illness days and infectious illness episodes among children. This association was not found for illness-related absenteeism.
Conclusions
Classes that succeeded in achieving a high level of implementation of the Hi Five Intervention had a lower number of infectious illness days and infectious illness episodes, suggesting that the Hi Five Intervention, if implemented adequately, may be relevant as a tool to decrease infectious illness in a Danish school setting."

The purpose of this single-center, ecologic study is to characterize the relationship between facility-wide (FacWide) antibiotic consumption and incident health care facility-onset Clostridium difficile infection (HO-CDI).
Methods
FacWide antibiotic consumption and incident HO-CDI were tallied on a monthly basis and standardized, from January 2013 through April 2015. Spearman rank-order correlation coefficients were calculated using matched-months analysis and a 1-month delay. Regression analyses were performed, with P < .05 considered statistically significant.
Results
FacWide analysis identified a matched-months correlation between ceftriaxone and HO-CDI (ρ = 0.44, P = .018). A unit of stem cell transplant recipients did not have significant correlation between carbapenems and HO-CDI in matched months (ρ = 0.37, P = .098), but a significant correlation was observed when a 1-month lag was applied (ρ = 0.54, P = .014).
Discussion
Three statistically significant lag associations were observed between FacWide/unit-level antibiotic consumption and HO-CDI, and 1 statistically significant nonlagged association was observed FacWide. Antibiotic consumption may convey extended ward-level risk for incident CDI.
Conclusions
Consumption of antibiotic agents may have immediate and prolonged influence on incident CDI. Additional studies are needed to investigate the immediate and delayed associations between antibiotic consumption and C difficile colonization, infection, and transmission at the hospital level."

Extensive data suggests that hand hygiene is a critical intervention for reducing infectious disease transmission in the clinical setting. However, it is unclear whether hand hygiene is effective at cutting down on infectious illnesses in non-clinical workplaces. The aim of this review is to assess the current literature concerning the effects of hand-washing interventions on infectious disease prevention among employees in nonclinical, office-based workplaces.
Methods
In compiling this review, PubMed, Scopus, and Business Source Premier were examined for studies published from 1960 through 2016.
Results
Eleven studies (eight experimental, two observational, one a simulation) were identified as eligible for inclusion. Hand-hygiene interventions at various levels of rigor were shown to reduce self-reported illness symptoms.
Conclusions
Hand hygiene is thought to be more effective against gastrointestinal illness than it is against respiratory illness, but no clear consensus has been reached on this point. Minimal hand-hygiene interventions seem to be effective at reducing the incidence of employee illness. Along with reducing infections among employees, hand-hygiene programs in the workplace may provide additional benefits to employers by reducing the number of employee health insurance claims and improving employee morale. Future research should use objective measures of hand hygiene and illness, and explore economic impacts on employers more fully."

No study in the current literature has scientifically clarified the transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) via personal hygiene tools. We determined risk of household transmission of HBV via nail scissors. Moreover, we assessed whether nails from HBV-infected people contained HBV, and evaluated correlations of HBV DNA levels of serum, nail specimens, and nail scissors.
Methods
Seventy patients testing positive for the surface antigen of the hepatitis B virus (63 positive for HBV DNA) treated for HBV infection and 27 healthy individuals were included. Real-time polymerase chain reaction method was used to detect HBV DNA levels in sera, nail, and nail scissors.
Results
HBV DNA was detected on 27% of nail scissors and in 50% of nail specimens from 63 serum HBV DNA-positive patients. Serum HBV DNA level >105 IU/mL was associated with 71.8% probability of nail scissors being HBV DNA-positive (P < .05). Serum HBV DNA level >107 IU/mL was associated with 71.5% probability of fingernails being HBV DNA-positive (P > .05). Shared-use of nail scissors was correlated with surface antigen of the hepatitis B virus positivity and total hepatitis B core antibody/immunoglobulin G positivity. A high HBV DNA level was detected in nail scissors and low level HBV DNA in the nails of persons with high serum HBV DNA levels.
Conclusions
Nail scissors, shared-use of nail scissors, and duration of shared use play important roles in household transmission of HBV. Level of education within society in this regard should be increased via mass media."

The objective of this article is to assess health care worker (HCW) and patient care factors associated with bacterial contamination of scrubs.
Methods
We performed a cohort study of critical care HCWs. Participants were given 4 sets of new scrubs; each set was sampled 8 times during the 8-month study period on random days in the last 4 hours of the shift. Total colony counts and presence of prespecified pathogenic bacteria were assessed. Generalized estimating equation was used to identify factors associated with contamination.
Results
There were 720 samples obtained from 90 HCWs; 30% of samples were contaminated with pathogenic bacteria. Multivariate analysis showed that providing care for patients with wounds (odds ratio [OR], 1.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-2.62; P < .01) or giving a bath (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 0.96-2.22; P = .07) was associated with higher odds of scrub contamination. A second model showed the average log colony count of bacterial contamination of scrubs was higher when a bath was given (log colony count difference, 0.21; P = .05) but lower among HCWs assigned to care for at least 1 patient on contact precautions (log colony count difference, 0.28; P < .01).
Conclusions
HCW attire was frequently contaminated with bacteria. Providing care for patients with wounds or giving a bath were associated with scrub contamination by pathogenic bacteria. However, the amount of contamination was lower among HCWs who were assigned to care for patients on contact precautions."

Single outbreaks have often been reported in health care settings, but the frequency of outbreaks at a hospital over time has not been described. We examined epidemiologic features of all health care–associated outbreak investigations at an academic hospital during a 5-year period.
Methods
Health care–associated outbreak investigations at an academic hospital (2012-2016) were retrospectively reviewed through data on comprehensive hospital-wide surveillance and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis.
Results
Fifty-one health care–associated outbreaks (annual range, 8-15), including 26 (51%) outbreaks in intensive care units (ICUs), and 263 infected-colonized patients involved in these outbreaks were identified. The frequency of pathogens varied by affected location, specifically multidrug-resistant organisms (20/26 outbreaks, 77% in ICUs vs 2/25 outbreaks, 8% in non-ICUs; P < .0001) and gastroenteritis because of Clostridium difficile, norovirus, or adenovirus (1/26 outbreaks, 4% in ICUs vs 17/25 outbreaks, 68% in non-ICUs; P < .0001). Outbreaks occurred in approximately one-third of all units (37%) with some repeated instances of the same pathogens. Of 16 outbreaks caused by a bacterial pathogen evaluated by PFGE, 12 (75%) included some indistinguishable strains, suggesting person-to-person transmission or a common source.
Conclusions
This study demonstrated epidemiologic characteristics of multiple outbreaks between ICUs and non-ICUs and the value of molecular typing in understanding the epidemiology of health care–associated outbreaks."

We aimed to describe the effectiveness of our standardized protocol for febrile neutropenia (FN), which was targeted to minimize unintended outcomes and reduce antimicrobial consumption.
Methods
The study was performed in a private hospital with 300 beds. We included all adult hematologic and oncologic cancer inpatients admitted between January 1, 2015-December 31, 2015, and January 1, 2016-May 31, 2017. The outcomes of the study were fatality, infections, and adherence to the antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP).
Results
We included 152 FN attacks of 95 adult inpatients from hematology and oncology wards; of these, 43% were women, and the median age was 57 years. The case fatality rate was 30% in the pre-ASP period and decreased to 11% in the post-ASP period (P = .024). The appropriate adding or changing (P = .006) and appropriate continuation or de-escalation or discontinuation of antimicrobials improved (P < .001). In the post-ASP period, Staphylococcus spp infections (from 22% to 8%, P = .02) and gram-negative infections decreased (from 43% to 20%, P = .003). In the multivariate analysis, appropriate continuation or de-escalation or discontinuation was increased in the post-ASP period (odds ratio [OR], 4.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.82-10.41; P = .001), and gram-positive infections were decreased (OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.11-0.95, P = .041). Vancomycin and fluoroquinolone use decreased significantly.

abstract = "Background
Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) affect millions of patients every year. Pathogen transmission via fomites and healthcare workers (HCWs) contribute to the persistence of HAIs in hospitals. A critical parameter needed to assess risk of environmental transmission is the pathogen transfer efficiency between fomites and fingers. Recent studies have shown that pathogen transfer is not symmetric. In this study,we evaluated how the commonly used assumption of symmetry in transfer efficiency changes the dynamics of pathogen movement between patients and rooms and the exposures to uncolonized patients.
Methods
We developed and analyzed a deterministic compartmental model of Acinetobacter baumannii describing the contact-mediated process among HCWs, patients, and the environment. We compared a system using measured asymmetrical transfer efficiency to 2 symmetrical transfer efficiency systems.
Results
Symmetric models consistently overestimated contamination levels on fomites and underestimated contamination on patients and HCWs compared to the asymmetrical model. The magnitudes of these miscalculations can exceed 100%. Regardless of the model, relative percent reductions in contamination declined after hand hygiene compliance reached approximately 60% in the large fomite scenario and 70% in the small fomite scenario.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates how healthcare facility-specific data can be used for decision-making processes. We show that the incorrect use of transfer efficiency data leads to biased effectiveness estimates for intervention strategies. More accurate exposure models are needed for more informed infection prevention strategies."

The domestic response to the West Africa Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic from 2014-2016 provides a unique opportunity to distill lessons learned about health sector planning and operations from those individuals directly involved. This research project aimed to identify and integrate these lessons into an actionable checklist that can improve health sector resilience to future high-consequence infectious disease (HCID) events.
Methods
Interviews (N = 73) were completed with individuals involved in the domestic EVD response in 4 cities (Atlanta, Dallas, New York, and Omaha), and included individuals who worked in academia, emergency management, government, health care, law, media, and public health during the response. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed qualitatively. Two focus groups were then conducted to expand on themes identified in the interviews. Using these themes, an evidence-informed checklist was developed and vetted for completeness and feasibility by an expert advisory group.
Results
Salient themes identified included health care facility issues—specifically identifying assessment and treatment hospitals, isolation and treatment unit layout, waste management, community relations, patient identification, patient isolation, limitations on treatment, laboratories, and research considerations—and health care workforce issues—specifically psychosocial impact, unit staffing, staff training, and proper personal protective equipment.

Methods
We describe characteristics and reporting patterns of facilities enrolled in the first 3 years of the surveillance system and rate estimates for CDI, UTI, and MRSA data submitted between 2013 and 2015.
Results
From 2013-2015, 279 LTCFs were enrolled and eligible to report to the NHSN with variability in reporting from year to year. Crude rate estimates pooled over these 3 years from reporting facilities were 0.98 incident LTCF-onset CDI cases per 10,000 resident days, 0.59 UTI cases per 1,000 resident days, and 0.10 LTCF-onset MRSA cases per 1,000 resident days.
Conclusions
These initial data demonstrate the capability of the NHSN LTCF Component as a national surveillance system for monitoring infections in LTCFs. Further investigation is needed to understand factors associated with successful enrollment and reporting. As participation increases, data from a larger group of LTCFs will be used to establish national baselines and track prevention goals."

There is a growing recognition of the need to partner with nurses to promote effective antibiotic stewardship. In this study, we explored the attitudes of nurses and infection preventionists toward 5 nurse-driven antibiotic stewardship practices: 1) questioning the need for urine cultures; 2) ensuring proper culturing technique; 3) recording an accurate penicillin drug allergy history; 4) encouraging the prompt transition from intravenous (IV) to oral (PO) antibiotics; and 5) initiating an antibiotic timeout.
Methods
Nine focus groups and 4 interviews with 49 clinical nurses, 5 nurse managers, and 7 infection preventionists were conducted across 2 academic pediatric and adult hospitals.
Results
Nurse-driven antibiotic stewardship was perceived as an extension of the nurses' role as patient advocate. Three practices were perceived most favorably: questioning the necessity of urinary cultures, ensuring proper culturing techniques, and encouraging the prompt transition from IV to PO antibiotics. Remaining recommendations were perceived to lack relevance or to challenge traditionally held nursing responsibilities. Prescriber and family engagement were noted to assist the implementation of select recommendations. Infection preventionists welcomed the opportunity to assist in providing nurse stewardship education.
Conclusions
Nurses appeared to be enthusiastic about participating in antibiotic stewardship. Efforts to engage nurses should address knowledge needs and consider the contexts in which nurse-driven antibiotic stewardship occurs."

abstract = "Background
Group B Streptococcus (GBS) remains a leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. This study aimed to determine the prevalence, antimicrobial susceptibility, serotypes, and molecular characterization of GBS colonized in neonates.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted using a multistage sampling method. Swabs for GBS identification were taken from infants' ear, oral cavity, and umbilicus immediately after birth. All GBS isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, resistance genes, serotyping, multilocus sequence typing, and virulence genes.
Results
Of the 1,814 neonates, 1.3% tested positive for GBS, with 66.7% tested as multidrug resistant. All GBS isolates were susceptible to penicillin, but rates of resistance to tetracycline and erythromycin were high (70.8%), with the predominant resistance genes being tetM and ermB. The predominant serotype was III, followed by Ia and Ib, and the most common genotypes were sequence type (ST) 19, ST10, and ST485. Notably, we found that ST19 and ST17 isolates were associated with serotype III, resistant to tetracycline, erythromycin, and clindamycin, and carrying ermB, tetM, and rib; ST10 and ST12 isolates were associated with serotype Ib, resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin, and carrying ermB and alphaC; and ST485 isolates were associated with serotype Ia and carrying mefA/E, tetM, and epsilon.
Conclusions
These findings indicate a high prevalence of multidrug-resistant GBS and specific phenotype-genotype combinations for GBS clones."

abstract = "Background
Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) occur frequently in neurological intensive care units (neuro-ICUs); however, data differentiating associations with various diagnostic categories and resulting burdens are limited. This prospective cohort study reported incidence rates, pathogen distribution, and patient-related outcomes of HAIs in a neuro-ICU population from April 2010 to March 2016.
Methods
Laboratory results and specific clinical indicators were used to categorize infections as per National Healthcare Safety Network nosocomial infection surveillance definitions. Patient outcomes studied included length of stay and mortality.
Results
There were 6,033 neuro-ICU admissions resulting in 20,800 neuro-ICU days over the 6-year study period. A total of 227 HAIs were identified for a rate of 10.9/1,000 ICU days. Device-associated infections accounted for 80.6% of HAIs, with incidence rates (per 1,000 device days) being 18.4 for ventilator-associated pneumonia; 4.9 for catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs); 4.0 for ventriculostomy-associated infections; and 0.6 for central line-associated blood stream infections (CLABSIs). Of the various diagnostic categories, subdural hematoma and intracerebral/intraventricular hemorrhage were associated with the highest pooled HAIs, with incidence rates of 21.3 and 21.1 per 1,000 neuro-ICU days, respectively. Prolonged neuro-ICU length of stay was strongly associated with all HAIs.
Conclusions
This large-scale surveillance study provides estimates of the risk of common HAIs in neurocritical care patients and their effect on hospitalization. Preventive strategies kept rates of infection very low, in particular CAUTI, CLABSI, and Clostridium difficile infections, and inhibited the emergence of resistant organisms."

Medical students in their clinical years play an important role in healthcare delivery, yet poor levels of hand hygiene (HH) compliance in this population raise the risk for propagating nosocomial infections. To date, there has been a lack of dedicated interventions showing sustainable improvements in HH in this population.
Methods
A multicenter, cross-sectional study was conducted among 450 medical students in their clinical years (third to fifth years). A self-administered, pre-validated questionnaire based on the World Health Organization's “Knowledge” and “Perception” questionnaires was used to explore HH knowledge, attitudes, practices, and desired interventions.
Results
Self-reported HH compliance was found to be low (56.8%), and moderate HH knowledge (61.8%) was observed among all study respondents. Public university students expressed greater knowledge than students in private and semi-private universities. Superior HH practices were associated with better individual HH attitudes, positive perceived HH attitudes in other healthcare workers (HCWs), and higher HH knowledge scores. The highest-rated interventions for improving HH compliance included role-modeling by HCWs, display of “clear HH instructions,” and “ensuring availability of hand sanitizers.”
Conclusion
Our results call for a multifaceted approach to improve HH compliance among medical students, by ensuring adequate HH supplies/hand sanitizers, providing HH training in curricula, and effecting a cultural change mediated by professional modeling and open communication."

An automated protocol was designed within our electronic medical record (EMR) to help curb the Clostridium difficile problem at our institution. The protocol will identify patients at high risk for C difficile, improve the timing of testing of patients infected on admission, and enhance the appropriateness of C difficile testing throughout the patient's hospitalization.
Methods
Admitted patients with 2 of the following 3 criteria were labeled as high risk for C difficile: admission to a medical institution in the preceding 90 days, administration of antibiotics in the preceding 90 days, or a history of C difficile. High-risk patients with diarrhea in the first 3 days of admission are identified in the EMR, and prompt testing for C difficile is done. After day 3, if diarrhea develops, a series of questions is presented to help test the appropriate patients for C difficile.
Results
A statistically significant reduction in rates of hospital-onset C difficile was achieved after implementation of the protocol.
Conclusions
Implementation of an automated protocol for targeted testing of high-risk patients for C difficile was successful at reducing rates of hospital-onset C difficile by improving timing and appropriateness of testing."

Australia has established guidelines on cleaning for reusable ultrasound probes and accompanying equipment. This is a preliminary study investigating cleanliness standards of patient-ready ultrasound equipment in 5 separate health care facilities within a major city.
Methods
The cleanliness was assessed using rapid adenosine triphosphate (ATP) testing used with a sampling algorithm which mitigates variability normally associated with ATP testing. Each surface was initially sampled in duplicate for relative light units (RLUs) and checked for compliance with literature recommended levels of cleanliness (<100 RLUs). Triplicate sampling was undertaken where necessary. A cleaning intervention step (CIS) followed using a disposable detergent wipe, and the surface was retested for ATP.
Results
There were 253 surfaces tested from the 5 health care facilities with 26% (66/253) demonstrating either equivocal or apparent lack of cleanliness. The CIS was conducted on 148 surfaces and demonstrated that for >91% (135/148) of surfaces, the cleaning standards could be improved significantly (P > .001). For 6% (9/148) of devices and surfaces, the CIS needed to be repeated at least once to achieve the intended level of cleanliness (<25 RLUs).
Conclusions
This study indicates that ATP testing is an effective, real-time, quality assurance tool for cleanliness monitoring of ultrasound probes and associated equipment."

Bacterial culture is the accepted standard to measure the adequacy of high-level disinfection (HLD) of duodenoscopes. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) bioluminescence assays have been suggested as an alternative method of evaluating the quality of reprocessing. We systematically reviewed published research describing the correlation between ATP and bacterial cultures.
Methods
The primary outcome was the correlation or concordance between concomitantly sampled ATP and bacterial contamination obtained from the instrument channel and/or elevator mechanism of the duodenoscope. A secondary outcome included the reduction in ATP measurements between paired samples before and after stages of duodenoscope reprocessing.
Results
Ten studies were included in the analysis. Four studies reported the relationship between concomitantly sampled ATP and cultures. Three studies reported receiver operating characteristic curves (1 study additionally reported a Wilcoxon rank sum test), and 1 study reported Spearman correlation coefficients and paired dichotomous measurements of ATP and bacterial contamination. All analyses suggested a poor relationship between the 2 measures. Studies measuring ATP before and after manual cleaning and before and after HLD reported a reduction in ATP after the reprocessing stage.
Conclusion
Current research does not support the direct substitution of ATP for bacterial culture surveillance of duodenoscopes. Serial ATP measurement may be a useful tool to evaluate the adequacy of manual cleaning and for training of endoscopic reprocessing staff."

Although it is well known that hand hygiene is the most effective measure to prevent health care–associated infections, hand hygiene adherence is low in Quebec, as it is elsewhere. For this study, an innovative framework was used to explore the clinical practice of nurses regarding hand hygiene and the factors that influence it: positive deviance, or the idea that there are people who find better solutions to problems than their peers. This study investigated positive deviance at the level of the care team to shed light on group dynamics.
Methods
We conducted focused ethnographies on 2 care units—a medical-surgery unit and a palliative care unit—at a Montreal university hospital. Data collection consisted mainly of systematic observations and individual interviews with nurses.
Results
The results show that positive deviance related to hand hygiene is instigated by social cohesion within a care team, created, in this study, by the mobilizing leadership of the head nurse in the medical-surgery unit and the prevailing humanist philosophy in the palliative care unit.
Conclusions
In health care, it can be useful to apply the positive deviance approach to care teams instead of individuals to better understand the ideologic and structural differences linked to better hand hygiene performance by the nurses."

Past studies have shown that infectious aerosols created during toilet flushing result in surface contamination of the restroom. The goals of this study were to quantify viral contamination of surfaces in restrooms after flushing and the impact of disinfectants added to the toilet bowl prior to flushing on reducing surface contamination.
Methods
The degree of contamination of surfaces in the restroom was assessed with and without the addition of coliphage MS2 to the toilet bowl before flushing. The bowl water and various surfaces in the restroom were subsequently tested for the presence of the virus.
Results
The toilet bowl rim, toilet seat top, and toilet seat underside were contaminated in all trials without a disinfectant added to the bowl water before flushing. All disinfectants significantly reduced concentrations on surfaces when the contact time was ≥15 minutes. Hydrogen peroxide resulted in very little reduction of virus in the toilet bowl (<1 log10). Peracetic acid and quaternary ammonium had the greatest log reductions on virus in the organic matter in the toilet.
Conclusions
Toilet flushing resulted in extensive contamination of surfaces within the restroom. Addition of disinfectant to the toilet bowl prior to flushing reduced the level of contamination in the bowl and fomites after flushing."

Objective
In this study, we sought to investigate the factors that affect patient compliance to antimicrobial therapy in a Chinese teaching hospital to enhance patient compliance and to prevent abuse and misuse of antibiotics by patients.
Methods
A questionnaire survey was conducted among patients willing to answer all the questions who were prescribed antimicrobial drugs orally, and for whom at least half of the duration of therapy was not under the supervision of a doctor or nurse. Data analyses were performed using Kruskal-Wallis test and multivariate logistic regression.
Results
A total of 720 patients participated in the survey; of these, 714 patients provided complete data and were included in the analysis. Up to 86.97% of patients showed noncompliance to antimicrobial therapy (total compliance score < 8), whereas 13.03% of patients showed good compliance (total compliance score = 8). On multivariate analyses, understanding of the treatment was an important factor associated with compliance.
Conclusions
A range of factors were associated with compliance to antimicrobial therapy, including understanding of the treatment, gender, age, home address, education level, and family income."

Poor hand hygiene by health care workers is a major cause of nosocomial infections. This research evaluated the ability of an electronic monitoring system with real-time prompting capability to change hand hygiene behaviors.
Methods
Handwashing activity was measured by counting dispenser activations on a single nursing unit before, during, and after installation of the system. The effect of changing the prompt duration on hand hygiene performance was determined by a cluster-randomized trial on 3 nursing units with 1 acting as control. Sustainability of performance and participation was observed on 4 nursing units over a year. All staff were eligible to participate.
Results
Between June 2015 and December 2016, a total of 459,376 hand hygiene opportunities and 330,740 handwashing events from 511 staff members were recorded. Dispenser activation counts were significantly influenced by use of the system (χ2[3] = 75.76; P < .0001). Hand hygiene performance dropped from 62.61% to 24.94% (odds ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.34-0.38) when the prompting feature was removed. Staff participation had a negative trajectory of –0.72% (P < .001), whereas change in average performance was –0.18% (P < .001) per week for the year.
Conclusions
Use of electronic monitoring with real-time prompts of 20 seconds' duration nearly doubles handwashing activity and causes handwashing to occur sooner after entering a patient room. These improvements are sustainable over a year."

Manual cleaning and disinfection of the operating room (OR) environment may be inadequate due to human error. No-touch technologies, such as pulsed-xenon ultraviolet light (PX-UV), can be used as an adjunct to manual cleaning processes to reduce surface contamination in the OR. This article reports the cumulative results from 23 hospitals across the United States that performed microbiologic validation of PX-UV disinfection after manual cleaning.
Methods
We obtained samples from 732 high-touch surfaces in 136 ORs at 23 hospitals, after manual terminal cleaning, and again after PX-UV disinfection (n = 1464 surface samples). Samples were enumerated after incubation, and the results are reported as total colony-forming units (CFU).
Results
The average CFU after manual cleaning ranged from 5.8 to 34.37, and after PX-UV, from 0.69 to 6.43. With manual cleaning alone, 67% of surfaces were still positive for CFUs; after PX-UV disinfection, that number decreased to 38% of all sampled surfaces—a 44% reduction. When comparing manual cleaning to PX-UV, the reduction in CFU count was statistically significant.
Conclusion
When used after the manual cleaning process, the PX-UV device significantly reduced contamination on high-touch surfaces in the OR."

Although disinfectants are used for eradication of bacteria from environmental surfaces, their antibiofilm efficacy is often not considered in determining the choice of disinfectant.
Aim
This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of 2 commonly used disinfectants, sodium hypochlorite and ethanol, against the planktonic and biofilm state of Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates.
Materials and methods
Effect of 0.6% sodium hypochlorite and 70% ethanol was determined on the planktonic and biofilm states of 10 strong and weak biofilm formers through estimation of changes in colony forming unit counts and absorbance values. The morphologic changes were observed by scanning electron microscopy.
Results
Significant difference in the efficacy of sodium hypochlorite and ethanol was observed against the biofilm (P = .004) as well as planktonic (P = .000) states of S aureus. However, no significant difference was observed in their activity against strong and weak biofilm formers. On electron microscopy, sodium hypochlorite was found to induce significant formation of craters and irregular depressions on the surface of strong biofilm formers.
Conclusions
Sodium hypochlorite demonstrated superior efficacy in controlling both planktonic and biofilm states of growth in S aureus. Furthermore, the characteristic morphologic changes observed in strong biofilm formers hint at its biofilm-specific activity."

In many countries, aseptic procedures are undertaken by nurses in the general ward setting, but variation in practice has been reported, and evidence indicates that the principles underpinning aseptic technique are not well understood.
Methods
A survey was conducted, employing a brief, purpose-designed, self-reported questionnaire.
Results
The response rate was 72%. Of those responding, 65% of nurses described aseptic technique in terms of the procedure used to undertake it, and 46% understood the principles of asepsis. The related concepts of cleanliness and sterilization were frequently confused with one another. Additionally, 72% reported that they not had received training for at least 5 years; 92% were confident of their ability to apply aseptic technique; and 90% reported that they had not been reassessed since their initial training. Qualitative analysis confirmed a lack of clarity about the meaning of aseptic technique.
Conclusion
Nurses' understanding of aseptic technique and the concepts of sterility and cleanliness is inadequate, a finding in line with results of previous studies. This knowledge gap potentially places patients at risk. Nurses' understanding of the principles of asepsis could be improved. Further studies should establish the generalizability of the study findings. Possible improvements include renewed emphasis during initial nurse education, greater opportunity for updating knowledge and skills post-qualification, and audit of practice."

Clostridium difficile is a prominent nosocomial pathogen and is the most common causative organism of health care–associated diarrhea. To our knowledge, no studies have investigated the impact of real-time notification of culture results with rapid antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) intervention in the setting of C difficile infection (CDI). The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of real-time notification of detection of toxigenic C difficile by DNA amplification results in patients with confirmed CDI.
Methods
This is a single-center, retrospective cohort study at a 433-bed tertiary medical center in central Kentucky. The study consisted of 2 arms: patients treated for CDI prior to implementation of real-time provider notification and patients postimplementation. The primary outcome was time to initiation of effective antimicrobial therapy.
Results
The median time to initiation of effective antimicrobial therapy decreased from 5.75 hours in the preimplementation cohort to 2.05 hours in the postimplementation cohort (P = .001). ASP intervention also resulted in a shorter time from detection of CDI to order entry of effective antimicrobial therapy in the patient's electronic medical record (3.0 vs 0.6 hours; P = .001).

abstract = "Background
Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are common nosocomial infections. In 2015, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began imposing financial penalties for institutions where CAUTI rates are higher than predicted. However, the surveillance definition for CAUTI is not a clinical diagnosis and may represent asymptomatic bacteriuria. The objective of this study was to compare rates of urinary catheterization and CAUTI before and after the implementation of a bundled intervention.
Methods
This retrospective review evaluated trauma patients from January 2013-January 2015. The bundled intervention optimized the urinary catheterization process and culturing practices to reduce false positives. The CAUTI rate was defined as a positive surveillance CAUTI divided by total catheter days multiplied by 1,000 days.
Results
A total of 6,236 patients were included (pre: n = 5,003; post: n = 1,233). Fewer patients in the post bundle group received a urinary catheter (pre: 25% vs post: 16%; P < .001). After bundle implementation, the CAUTI rate reduced over one third (pre: 4.07 vs post: 2.56; incidence rate ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.19-2.07).
Conclusions
Although the number of patients exposed to urinary catheters and catheter days was decreased, optimization of culturing practices was essential to prevent the CAUTI rate from increasing from a reduced denominator. Implementation of a CAUTI prevention bundle works synergistically to improve patient safety and hospital performance."

Cannulated surgical instruments may retain biologic debris after routine cleaning and sterilization. Residual debris after cleaning is assumed to be sterile; however, there is no experimental basis for this assumption. The purpose of this study was to determine the sterility of retained biodebris found within cannulated surgical instruments after autoclave sterilization.
Materials and Methods
Fifteen cannulated drill bits were used to drill pig scapulae to create a plug of bone that was exposed to a mixture of Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus for 60, 120, or 180 minutes prior to sterilization. The drill bits were autoclave sterilized using standard settings. The “sterilized” bone cores were then incubated in solution and streak-plated on blood agar.
Results
All 3 positive controls were positive for the experimental bacteria. Two negative controls were positive for contaminant bacteria. A B. cereus strain was recovered from 1 of the experimental group drill bits in the 180-minute group. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis confirmed that the recovered B. cereus strain was identical to the experimental inoculate.
Conclusion
Retained biodebris in cannulated drills may not be sterile after standard autoclave sterilization. In addition, delay of surgical instrument reprocessing may increase the risk of resistant contamination."

Transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) to health care personnel (HCP) is a major concern. This study aimed to review cases of MERS-related events, such as development of MERS-like symptoms or exposure to patients.
Methods
A MERS screening clinic (MSC) for HCP was setup in the National Medical Center during the MERS outbreak in 2015. Clinical and laboratory data from HCP who visited the MSC were retrospectively reviewed. Additionally, these data were compared with the results of postoutbreak questionnaire surveys and interviews about MERS-related symptoms and risk-related events.
Results
Of the 333 HCP who participated in MERS patient care, 35 HCP (10.5%) visited the MSC for MERS-like symptoms. No one was infected with MERS, and the most common symptom was fever (68.6%) followed by cough (34.3%). However, 106 of 285 postoutbreak survey participants experienced at least 1 MERS-related symptom and 26 reported exposure to patients without appropriate personal protective equipment, whereas only 4 HCP visited the MSC to report exposure events.
Conclusions
Although a considerable number of HCP experienced MERS-related symptoms or unprotected exposure during MERS patient care, some did not take appropriate action. These findings imply that for infection control strategy to be properly performed, education should be strengthened so that HCP can accurately recognize the risk situation and properly notify the infection control officer."

Environmental service workers may be exposed to pathogens during the cleaning of pathogen-containing bodily fluids.
Methods
Participants with experience cleaning hospital environments were asked to clean simulated, fluorescein-containing vomitus using normal practices in a simulated patient room. Fluorescein was visualized in the environment and on participants under black lights. Fluorescein was quantitatively measured on the floor, in the air, and on gloves and shoe covers.
Results
In all 21 trials involving 7 participants, fluorescein was found on the floor after cleaning and on participants' gloves. Lower levels of floor contamination were associated with the use of towels to remove bulk fluid (ρ = −0.56, P = .01). Glove contamination was not associated with the number or frequency of contacts with environmental surfaces, suggesting contamination occurs with specific events, such as picking up contaminated towels. Fluorescein contamination on shoe covers was measured in 19 trials. Fluorescein was not observed on participants' facial personal protective equipment, if worn, or faces. Contamination on other body parts, primarily the legs, was observed in 8 trials. Fluorescein was infrequently quantified in the air.
Conclusions
Using towels to remove bulk fluid prior to mopping is part of the recommended cleaning protocol and should be used to minimize residual contamination. Contamination on shoes and the floor may serve as reservoirs for pathogens."

Hand hygiene is one of the most important interventions in the quest to eliminate healthcare-associated infections, and rates in healthcare facilities are markedly low. Since hand hygiene observation and feedback are critical to improve adherence, we created an easy-to-use, platform-independent hand hygiene data collection process and an automated, on-demand reporting engine.
Methods
A 3-step approach was used for this project: 1) creation of a data collection form using Google Forms, 2) transfer of data from the form to a spreadsheet using Google Spreadsheets, and 3) creation of an automated, cloud-based analytics platform for report generation using R and RStudio Shiny software.
Results
A video tutorial of all steps in the creation and use of this free tool can be found on our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFatMR1rXqU&t. The on-demand reporting tool can be accessed at: https://crsp.louisville.edu/shiny/handhygiene.
Conclusions
This data collection and automated analytics engine provides an easy-to-use environment for evaluating hand hygiene data; it also provides rapid feedback to healthcare workers. By reducing some of the data management workload required of the infection preventionist, more focused interventions may be instituted to increase global hand hygiene rates and reduce infection."

Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) have been proposed as a solution for the global burden of antibiotic resistance, despite the lack of evidence on the subject.
Objective
To analyze the role of ASPs in reducing bacterial resistance to antibiotics in hospital settings.
Data sources
A review in PubMed, Scopus, LILACS, and SciELO databases was performed. The period analyzed was January 1, 2012-January 4, 2017.
Eligibility criteria
Studies that related ASPs to bacterial resistance.
Data extraction
All studies that did not focus on ASPs were removed. Antifungal and antiviral programs were excluded.
Results
Only 8 studies had quasi-experimental designs, and none were controlled trials. ASP strategies and microorganism-antibiotic pairs evaluated varied widely. Seven studies were classified as presenting clearly positive results, 3 had limited positive results, 7 had doubtful results, 4 had negative results, and 5 had noninterpretable results. The implementation of new infection control practices occurred in 7 studies.
Limitations
There are yet few studies on this matter, and most of them have inadequate study designs. Great heterogeneity between study features was detrimental to drawing evidence-based conclusions.
Conclusions
There is no solid evidence that ASPs are effective in reducing antibiotic resistance in hospital settings. We uphold the need for more studies with appropriate study designs, standardized ASP interventions targeting common microorganism-antibiotic pairs, and avoiding simultaneous implementation of infection control practices."

abstract = "Background
This article describes a large nonprofit health care system's approach at quantifying the actual number of infection preventionist (IP) and relative support staff required to build and sustain effective infection prevention programs.
Methods
A list of all physical locations within the organization requiring infection prevention coverage were identified via survey, including department-level detail for 34 hospitals, 583 ambulatory sites, and 26 in-home and long-term care programs across 5 states. Required IP activities for each physical location were also tallied by task. Type of activity, frequency (times per year), hours per activity, and total number of locations in which each activity should occur were determined. From this, the number of hours per week of infection prevention labor resources needed was calculated.
Results
Quantitative needs assessment revealed actual labor need to be 31%-66% above current benchmarks of 0.5-1.0 IP per 100 occupied beds. When aggregated across the organization, the comprehensive review results yielded a new benchmark of 1.0 infection prevention full-time equivalent per 69 beds if ambulatory, long-term care, or home care are included.
Conclusions
Size, scope, services offered, populations cared for, and type of care settings all impact the actual need for IP coverage, making the survey benchmarks available in the literature invalid. A comprehensive assessment of health care organization composition and structure is necessary prior to determining the IP staffing needs for that organization."

Endoscopy-associated infection transmission is frequently linked to inadequate reprocessing. Residual organic material and moisture may foster biofilm development inside endoscopes. This study evaluated the effectiveness of endoscope drying and storage methods and assessed associations between retained moisture and contamination.
Methods
Endoscope reprocessing, drying, and storage practices were assessed at 3 hospitals. Researchers performed visual examinations and tests to detect fluid and contamination on patient-ready endoscopes.
Results
Fluid was detected in 22 of 45 (49%) endoscopes. Prevalence of moisture varied significantly by site (5%; 83%; 85%; P < .001). High adenosine triphosphate levels were found in 22% of endoscopes, and microbial growth was detected in 71% of endoscopes. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Citrobacter freundii, and Lecanicillium lecanii/Verticillium dahliae were found. Retained fluid was associated with significantly higher adenosine triphosphate levels (P < .01). Reprocessing and drying practices conformed with guidelines at 1 site and were substandard at 2 sites. Damaged endoscopes were in use at all sites.
Conclusions
Inadequate reprocessing and insufficient drying contributed to retained fluid and contamination found during this multisite study. More effective methods of endoscope reprocessing, drying, and maintenance are needed to prevent the retention of fluid, organic material, and bioburden that could cause patient illness or injury."

Large outbreaks of infection by Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been reported. This research compares characteristics of such outbreaks.
Objectives
Determination of risk factors for the occurrence and appropriate infection control measures.
Data Sources
The Outbreak Database, PubMed, and reference lists of identified articles were used. Key words included nosocomial and (outbreak or epidemic) and (aeruginosa or baumannii).
Study Eligibility Criteria
Articles were included if they describe distinct outbreak(s) caused by A baumannii or P aeruginosa and were published between 2000 and 2015. There were no further restrictions with respect to language or type of article.
Results
One hundred fifty outbreaks by A baumannii and 131 outbreaks by P aeruginosa were included, including multidrug-resistant strains in 113 Acinetobacter and 49 Pseudomonas outbreaks. Acinetobacter outbreaks were mainly reported from intensive care units, after use of antibiotics, during mechanical ventilation, and presented with a mortality rate of 47% compared with 23% by Pseudomonas. Resistance did not alter mortality by either species. Most infection control measures were implemented or enforced more often in Acinetobacter outbreaks.
Conclusions
These findings should support staff in infection control departments and on wards if an outbreak is suspected. Better adherence to the Outbreak Reports and Intervention Studies of Nosocomial Infection guidelines in outbreak reporting is necessary. A precise definition of multidrug resistance for Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas is lacking."

Safe and effective decontamination and reuse of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) has the potential to significantly extend FFR holdings, mitigating a potential shortage due to an influenza pandemic or other pandemic events. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) has been shown to be effective for decontaminating influenza-contaminated FFRs. This study aims to build on past research by evaluating the UVGI decontamination efficiency of influenza-contaminated FFRs in the presence of soiling agents using an optimized UVGI dose.
Methods
Twelve samples each of 15 N95 FFR models were contaminated with H1N1 influenza (facepiece and strap), then covered with a soiling agent—artificial saliva or artificial skin oil. For each soiling agent, 3 contaminated FFRs were treated with 1 J/cm2 UVGI for approximately 1 minute, whereas 3 other contaminated FFRs remained untreated. All contaminated surfaces were cut out and virus extracted. Viable influenza was quantified using a median tissue culture infectious dose assay.
Results
Significant reductions (≥3 log) in influenza viability for both soiling conditions were observed on facepieces from 12 of 15 FFR models and straps from 7 of 15 FFR models.
Conclusions
These data suggest that FFR decontamination and reuse using UVGI can be effective. Implementation of a UVGI method will require careful consideration of FFR model, material type, and design."

Clostridium difficile–associated diarrhea (CDAD) is an important disease with rising incidence and mortality in western countries. However, studies about CDAD in China are limited. The aims of this study are to investigate the epidemiology and risk factors of CDAD in a university hospital located in Eastern China.
Methods
Diarrhea samples of all adult inpatients were collected for C difficile culture prospectively from August 2013-April 2014. Suspected colonies were identified by biochemical identification cards. Confirmed C difficile isolates were further analyzed for the presence of toxin genes and typed by polymerase chain reaction ribotyping. Patient demographics, presumed risk factors, clinical manifestations, and laboratory findings were collected through inpatient medical record systems retrospectively.
Results
In total, 45 stains of toxigenic C difficile were isolated from 315 nonrepetitive diarrhea samples. The isolation rate was 14.29% (45/315). No RT027/ST1 strain was found. An outbreak of CDAD occurred in the digestive ward and was finally found to be caused by ST35 strains during this study. Coloclysis and diabetes were found to be independent risk factors of CDAD, besides the common risk factors previously reported.
Conclusions
CDAD is not uncommon in Chinese hospitals. C difficile ST35 as a new strain causing outbreaks should be noticed. Coloclysis and diabetes are new independent risk factors for CDAD, and further study is needed."

Methods
Patients included adults undergoing general anesthesia. Gram-negative isolates (N = 2,682) were collected from anesthesia work area reservoirs in 274 randomly selected operating room case pairs. Nine hundred and forty-five isolates were included in this study. Chi square tests were used to examine the association of anesthesia work area reservoirs with KAPE genera isolation.
Results
Acinetobacter pathogens were more likely to be isolated from anesthesia provider hands (risk ratio [RR], 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.10; corrected P = .004) and less likely to be isolated from patients (RR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.08-0.50; corrected P < .0001).

A recent study reported a reduction in probable/definite central venous catheter (CVC)-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) in neutropenic high-risk patients using CVC dressings with a chlorhexidine-containing gel pad.
Methods
Based on published data, a health-economic analysis was performed to analyze the economic effect of using CVC dressings with a chlorhexidine-containing gel pad compared to non-chlorhexidine control dressings. A micro-costing approach was used to determine CRBSI-related direct treatment cost factors.
Results
Between February 2012 and September 2014, 356 patients (178 patients in both groups) were analyzed. Distribution of probable and definite CRBSI in the chlorhexidine group and control group were 12 (7%) vs 18 (10%) and 9 (5%) vs 21 (12%), respectively (P = .011).

The most important cost driver in both groups was treatment on general ward (€4275 [US$ 5173], interquartile range [IQR]: €592 - €6504 [US$ 716 - US$ 7871] vs €4560 [US$ 5518], IQR: €1227 - €8567 [US$ 1485 - US$ 10,367]; P = .120), resulting in median overall direct treatment costs of €13,881 (US$ 16,798) [IQR: €10,922 - €25,457 (US$ 13,217 - US$ 30,807) vs €13,929 [US$ 16,856] [IQR: €11,295 - €23,561 (US$ 13,669 - US$ 28,512); P = .640]).
Conclusion
Our study shows similar results in overall direct treatment costs, meaning that higher acquisition costs of chlorhexidine-containing dressings did not translate into higher costs. Expenses were primarily outweighed by a lower rate of probable/definite CRBSI and reduced associated costs."

The public often turn to social media for information during emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) outbreaks. This study identified the major approaches and assessed the rigors in published research articles on EIDs and social media.
Methods
We searched 5 databases for published journal articles on EIDs and social media. We then evaluated these articles in terms of EIDs studied, social media examined, theoretical frameworks, methodologic approaches, and research findings.
Results
Thirty articles were included in the analysis (published between January 1, 2010, and March 1, 2016). EIDs that received most scholarly attention were H1N1 (or swine flu, n = 15), Ebola virus (n = 10), and H7N9 (or avian flu/bird flu, n = 2). Twitter was the most often studied social media (n = 17), followed by YouTube (n = 6), Facebook (n = 6), and blogs (n = 6). Three major approaches in this area of inquiry are identified: (1) assessment of the public's interest in and responses to EIDs, (2) examination of organizations' use of social media in communicating EIDs, and (3) evaluation of the accuracy of EID-related medical information on social media.
Conclusions
Although academic studies of EID communication on social media are on the rise, they still suffer from a lack of theorization and a need for more methodologic rigor."

abstract = "Background
Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are the most common healthcare-acquired condition. The attributable cost of CAUTIs is frequently cited to be approximately $1,000. However, there is a paucity of recent literature that confirms this estimate. The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review of the literature that estimates the attributable cost of CAUTIs in the United States.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted using Pubmed. Studies conducted between the years 2000 and 2017, conducted at a facility within the United States, and that used novel patient-level cost data were included. Attributable cost estimates were adjusted for inflation to 2016 U.S. dollars using the medical care component of the Consumer Price Index.
Results
Only 4 articles met our inclusion criteria. Adjusted to 2016 U.S. dollars, the attributable costs of a CAUTI as reported in these studies were: $876 (inpatient cost to the hospital for additional diagnostic tests and medications); $1,764 (inpatient cost to Medicare for non-intensive care unit [ICU] patients); $7,670 (inpatient and outpatient costs to Medicare); $8,398 (inpatient cost to the hospital for pediatric patients); and $10,197 (inpatient cost to Medicare for ICU patients).
Conclusions
The cost of a CAUTI ranges widely depending on population, patient acuity, and cost perspective. Attributable costs likely exceed $1,000. Additional research is needed to assess the full economic effect of CAUTIs."

Prolonged use of indwelling catheters is associated with hospital-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs). Literature is scarce about the factors influencing urinary catheter removal and maintenance in children. This study aims to describe the determinants of urinary catheter removal in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) patients.
Methods
Cross-sectional survey of 171 physicians and nurses working at 2 tertiary PICUs in Montreal, Canada. We used focus groups and literature review to design the survey questions and 3 clinical scenarios. We analyzed our results using descriptive statistics and multivariate multinomial regression.
Results
There were 131 (77%) participants who answered the survey. Factors prompting urinary catheter removal (P < .01) included recent extubation, superficial sedation level, fever, and history of previous UTI. Presence of shock (P < .01) and fluid overload (P < .05) were associated with maintenance of catheters. Physicians were more likely to remove urinary catheters than nurses in all scenarios.
Conclusions
We identified a consistent set of variables that drive the removal of indwelling catheters in PICUs. Studies are needed to determine whether incorporating these determinants into infection control interventions will reduce urinary catheter use and catheter-associated UTIs in critically ill children."

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) causes a significant burden of illness in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) worldwide. Identifying infants colonized with MRSA has become an important infection control strategy to interrupt nosocomial transmission.
Objective
Assess risk factors for MRSA colonization in NICUs via a systematic review and meta-analysis.
Data sources
MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library databases were searched from inception through September 2015.
Study selection
Studies reporting risk factors for MRSA colonization using noncolonized controls in subspecialty level III or IV NICUs were included.
Data extraction
Two authors independently extracted data on MRSA colonization risk factors, study design, and MRSA screening methodology.
Results
Eleven articles were included in the systematic review, with 10 articles analyzed via meta-analysis. MRSA colonization was associated with gestational age <32 weeks (odds ratio [OR], 2.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35-5.27; P = .01) and birth weight <1,500 g (OR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.25-5.55; P = .01). Infant sex (P = .21), race (P = .06), inborn status (P = .09), and delivery type (P = .24) were not significantly associated with colonization.
Conclusions
Very preterm and very-low birth weight infants were identified as having an increased risk for MRSA colonization on meta-analysis. Multifaceted infection prevention strategies should target these high-risk infants to reduce MRSA colonization rates in NICUs."

The Researching Effective Approaches to Cleaning in Hospitals (REACH) study tested a multimodal cleaning intervention in Australian hospitals. This article reports findings from a pre/post questionnaire, embedded into the REACH study, that was administered prior to the implementation of the intervention and at the conclusion of the study.
Methods
A cross-sectional questionnaire, nested within a stepped-wedge trial, was administered. The REACH intervention was a cleaning bundle comprising 5 interdependent components. The questionnaire explored the knowledge, reported practice, attitudes, roles, and perceived organizational support of environmental services staff members in the hospitals participating in the REACH study.
Results
Environmental services staff members in 11 participating hospitals completed 616 pre- and 307 post-test questionnaires (n = 923). Increases in knowledge and practice were seen between the pre-and post-test questionnaires. Minimal changes were observed in attitudes regarding the role of cleaning and in perceived organizational support.
Conclusion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to report changes in knowledge, attitudes, and perceived organizational support in environmental services staff members, in the context of a large multicenter clinical trial. In this underexplored group of hospital workers, findings suggest that environmental services staff members have a high level of knowledge related to cleaning practices and understand the importance of their role."

In January 2015, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)/National Health Safety Network (NHSN) changed the definition of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI). We evaluated the outcomes of a robust CAUTI prevention program when we performed surveillance using the old definition (before 2015) versus the new definition (after 2015). This is the first study to evaluate how the change in CDC/NHSN definitions affected the outcomes of a CAUTI reduction program.
Methods
Baseline was from January 2012 to September 2014; the intervention period was from October 2014 to February 2016. Staff nurses were trained to be liaisons of infection prevention (Link Nurses) with clearly defined CAUTI prevention goals and with ongoing monthly activities. CAUTI incidence per 1000 catheter days was compared between the baseline and intervention periods, using the 2 definitions.
Results
With the new definition, CAUTIs decreased by 33%, from 2.69 to 1.81 cases per 1000 catheter days (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.48-0.93; P < .016). With the old definition, CAUTIs increased by 12%, from 3.38 to 3.80 cases per 1000 catheter days (IRR = 1.12; 95% CI: 0.88-1.43; P = .348).
Conclusion
We aggressively targeted CAUTI prevention, but a reduction was observed only with the new definition. Our findings stress the importance of having a reasonably accurate surveillance definition to monitor infection prevention initiatives."

abstract = "Background
This study was designed to determine whether removing bacteria from the air with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UV-C) at the room level would reduce infection rates.
Methods
We reviewed infection data for 12 months before and after UV-C installation in the special care unit (SCU) of a long-term acute care hospital. All patients admitted to the SCU during the study time frame were included. Microbiologic impactor air sampling was completed in August 2015. Shielded UV-C units were installed in 16 patient rooms, the hallway, and the biohazard room. Air sampling was repeated 81 days later.
Results
After UV-C installation, airborne bacteria (colony forming units [CFU] per cubic meter of air) in patient rooms were reduced an average of 42% (175 vs 102 CFU/m3). Common health care–associated infections (HAIs) (Clostridium difficile [8 cases annually vs 1 case, P = .01] and catheter-associated urinary tract infection [20 cases annually vs 9 cases, P = .012]) were reduced significantly as were overall infections, in number of cases (average 8.8 per month vs 3.5, P < .001), and infection rate (average monthly rate 20.3 vs 8.6, P = .001), despite no reported changes to the amount or type of cleaning done, infection control protocols, or reporting procedures. Other infections, traditionally considered contact transmissible (central line–associated bloodstream infection and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), also declined noticeably.
Conclusions
Continuous shielded UV-C reduced airborne bacteria and may also lower the number of HAIs, including those caused by contact pathogens. Reduced infections result in lessened morbidity and lower costs. Health care facilities might wish to consider continuous shielded UV-C at the room level as a possible addition to their infection prevention and control protocols."

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is increasingly prevalent, severe, and costly. Adherence to infection prevention practices remains suboptimal. More effective strategies to implement guidelines and evidence are needed.
Methods
Interprofessional focus groups consisting of physicians, resident physicians, nurses, and health technicians were conducted for a quality improvement project evaluating adherence to the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) nationally mandated C difficile prevention bundle. Qualitative analysis with a visual matrix display identified barrier and facilitator themes guided by the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety model, a human factors engineering approach.
Results
Several themes, encompassing both barriers and facilitators to bundle adherence, emerged. Rapid turnaround time of C difficile polymerase chain reaction testing was a facilitator of timely diagnosis. Too few, poorly located, and cluttered sinks were barriers to appropriate hand hygiene. Patient care workload and the time-consuming process of contact isolation precautions were also barriers to adherence. Multiple work system components serve as barriers to and facilitators of adherence to the VA CDI prevention bundle among an interprofessional group of health care workers. Organizational factors appear to significantly influence bundle adherence.
Conclusion
Interprofessional perspectives are needed to identify barriers to and facilitators of bundle implementation, which is a necessary first step to address adherence to bundled infection prevention practices."

The Ebola virus disease outbreak highlighted the lack of consistent guidelines and training for workers outside of hospital settings. Specifically, emergency medical services (EMS) workers, who are frequently the first professionals to evaluate patients, often do not have advanced notice of patient diagnosis, and have limited time in their national curricula devoted to highly infectious disease (HID) identification and containment. All of these can place them at increased risk. To explore the depth of US EMS practitioners' HID training and education, a pilot gap analysis survey was distributed to determine where the aforementioned can be bolstered to increase occupational safety.
Methods
Electronic surveys were distributed to EMS organization members. The survey collected respondent willingness to encounter HID scenarios; current policies and procedures; and levels of knowledge, training, and available resources to address HIDs.
Results
A total of 2,165 surveys were initiated and collected. Eighty percent of frontline personnel were aware that their agency had an HID standard operating guideline. Almost 85% of respondents correctly marked routes of exposure for select HIDs. More than half of respondents indicated no maximum shift times in personal protective equipment.
Discussion
This research suggests EMS practitioners could benefit from enhanced industry-specific education, training, and planning on HID mitigation and management.
Conclusion
Strengthening EMS preparedness in response to suspected or confirmed HID cases may not only improve patient outcomes, but also worker and community safety."

Inclusion criteria were defined as description of de novo implementation of an ICLN system, strengthening of an existing ICLN system, or analysis of an ICLN system.
Results
In 10 publications, facilitators and barriers were identified for mode of selection of ICLN candidates, characteristics and responsibilities of ICLNs, composition of a training curriculum, educational strategies, and external influencing factors. Experienced nurses with an interest in infection control seemed appropriate candidates. The importance of psychological skills in addition to technical knowledge was emphasized. A clear definition of responsibilities was important. Viable tasks for ICLNs included surveillance and teaching activities and the implementation of prevention measures. Ongoing teaching was superior to a single course. Management support was pivotal for success.

With the rising use of midline catheters (MCs), validation of their safety is essential. Our study aimed to evaluate the incidence of bloodstream infections (BSIs) and other complications related to the use of MCs and central venous catheters (CVCs).
Methods
A retrospective cohort study was performed at a tertiary care hospital in Detroit, Michigan, from March-September 2016. Adult patients with either MC or CVC were included. Outcomes assessed were catheter-related BSI (CRBSI), mechanical complications, hospital length of stay, readmission within 90 days of discharge (RA), and mortality. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS software.
Results
A total of 411 patients with MC and 282 patients with CVC were analyzed. More CRBSIs were seen in patients with CVC (10/282) than MC (1/411) (3.5% vs 0.2%, respectively; P = .0008). More mechanical complications were seen in patients with MC (2.6%) than CVC (0.3%; P = .03). Patients with CVC had a higher crude mortality (17.3% vs 5.3%; P < .0001), RA (58% vs 35%; P ≤ .0001), line-related RA (2.8% vs 0.2%; P = .0041), and transfer to intensive care unit after line placement (9% vs 5%; P = .01). CVC was a significant exposure for a composite of mortality, CRBSI, mechanical issues, thrombosis, and readmission because of a line-related complication (odds ratio, 3.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.8-5.8).
Conclusions
Our findings show use of MC is safer than CVC, but larger studies are needed to confirm our findings."

The aim of the study was to identify risk factors for sepsis morbidity in a rural hospital population.
Methods
We used a case-control study design. Patients included adult admissions to a rural health system between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2015. Case selection was by electronic medical record search for codes of the ICD-9-CM. Cases were validated against Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment criteria. Multiple logistic regression modeling was performed to determine which predefined variables were significantly associated with sepsis diagnosis.

A total of 220 patients were studied (110 cases and 110 controls). Cases had an in-hospital mortality of 20% compared with 0% of the controls. Indwelling medical device use during hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 3.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.44-6.30; P = .003), coronary heart disease (adjusted OR, 2.59; 95% CI, 1.13-5.97; P = .03), and type of health insurance (adjusted OR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.13-4.93; P = .02) were independently associated with sepsis diagnosis after adjusting for potential confounders.
Conclusions
This study underscores the need for implementation and maintenance of infection control measures during management of patients with indwelling medical devices at a rural hospital."

Hospital-acquired urinary tract-related bloodstream infections are rare but often lethal. Recent epidemiology of this condition among the United States veteran population is poorly described.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective review of hospital-acquired urinary tract-related bloodstream infections of adult inpatients admitted to 4 Veterans Affairs hospitals over 15 years. Electronic medical records were used to obtain clinical, demographic, and microbiologic information. Descriptive statistical analyses were conducted using chi-square tests of association. Test for trend was performed by genus of organism and for case fatality rate over time.
Results
While the most commonly isolated organisms were Staphylococcus spp. (36.5%), the incidence of infections caused by Escherichia and Klebsiella increased over time (P = .02 and P = .03, respectively). The overall in-hospital case fatality rate was 24.2% in 499 patients. The case fatality rate was 25.8% for patients with Staphylococcus infections and 20.7% for patients with enterococcal infections.
Conclusions
Hospital-acquired urinary tract-related bloodstream infection is commonly due to Staphylococcus spp. and is related to the high fatality among United States veterans. Focused infection control efforts could decrease the incidence of this fatal infection."

The use of long sleeves by nonscrubbed personnel in the operating room has been called into question. We hypothesized that wearing long sleeves and gloves, compared with having bare arms without gloves, while applying the skin preparation solution would decrease particulate and microbial contamination.
Methods
A mock patient skin prep was performed in 3 different operating rooms. A long-sleeved gown and gloves, or bare arms, were used to perform the procedure. Particle counters were used to assess airborne particulate contamination, and active and passive microbial assessment was achieved through air samplers and settle plate analysis. Data were compared with Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U, and P < .05 was considered to be significant.
Results
Operating room B demonstrated decreased 5.0- µm particle sizes with the use of sleeves, while operating rooms A and C showed decreased total microbes only with the use of sleeves. Despite there being no difference in the average number of total microbes for all operating rooms assessed, the use of sleeves specifically appeared to decrease the shed of Micrococcus.
Conclusion
The use of long sleeves and gloves while applying the skin preparation solution decreased particulate and microbial shedding in several of the operating rooms tested. Although long sleeves may not be necessary for all operating room personnel, they may decrease airborne contamination while the skin prep is applied, which may lead to decreased surgical site infections."

Speaking up by healthcare professionals (HCPs) is an important resource to reduce risks to patient safety. Due to complex tradeoffs, HCPs are often reluctant to voice their concerns. A survey investigated HCPs' likelihood to speak up.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey study among HCPs in 5 Swiss hospitals addressed speaking-up behaviors, safety climate, and likelihood to speak up about poor hand hygiene practice described in a vignette. Likelihood to speak up was analyzed using a multilevel regression model.
Results
Of surveyed HCPs (n = 1217), 56% reported that they would speak up to a colleague with poor hand hygiene practice. Nurses as compared to doctors rated the situation as more realistic (5.25 vs 4.32, P < .001), felt more discomfort with speaking up (4.00 vs 3.34, P < .001), and reported a slightly lower likelihood of speaking up (4.41 vs 4.77, P < .001). Clinical function (hierarchy) was strongly associated with speaking-up behavior (P < .001). Higher risk of harm to the patient (P < .001) and higher frequencies of past speaking-up behaviors (P = .006) were positively associated with the likelihood to speak up. Higher frequencies of past withholding voice (P = .013) and higher levels of resignation (P = .008) were both associated with a lower likelihood to speak up.
Conclusions
Infection control interventions should empower HCPs to speak up about non-adherence with prevention practices by addressing authority gradients and risk perceptions and by focusing on resignation."

Although evidence-based practices are known to improve the quality of care, making it cost-efficient and improving clinical results, barriers to transferring research into clinical practice have hindered this process.
Aims
To evaluate critical care nurses' knowledge of, adherence to, and barriers toward institution-specific ventilator bundle.
Material and methods
In 2015, we conducted an institution-specific, cross-sectional study in a 26-bed adult mixed medical-surgical intensive care unit (ICU) in Finland using quantitative survey of knowledge and self-reported adherence with qualitative gathering of barrier data. A pre-validated multiple-choice Ventilator Bundle Questionnaire was distributed to all registered nurses who were direct care providers (n = 155).
Results
The final response rate was 55.5% (n = 86), and 47.2% (n = 34) of respondents had more than 10 years of ICU experience. The levels of knowledge and self-reported adherence were 71.1% and 65.8% of the total score, respectively. The level of knowledge was higher among respondents who had received in-service education about ventilator bundle compared with respondents who had not received in-service education (27.0 vs 24.0 [P = .012]). Less experienced nurses reported significantly higher adherence than nurses with more ICU experience (29.0 vs 25.0 [P = .034]). The correlation between knowledge and adherence scores was low (ρ 0.48 [P < .001]). The most well-known and adhered-to guidelines described patient positioning, daily chlorhexidine-based oral care, and strict hand hygiene. The least-known guidelines and those least adhered to described respiratory equipment, management of sedation and analgesia, and practices prior to and during endotracheal suctioning. The main barriers were related to the nurse respondents (e.g., lack of education [25.9%]), environment (e.g., role ambiguities [36.4%] and inadequate resources [21.1%]), and patients (e.g., patient discomfort [4.8%] and fear of adverse effects [4.6%]).
Conclusions
Self-reported adherence did not correlate with knowledge and was not related to work experience. Most of the barriers toward evidence-based guidelines indicated a need for changes that are beyond the control of individual nurses."

abstract = "Background
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a pathogenic S aureus strain characteristic associated with increased patient morbidity and mortality. The health care system needs to understand MRSA transmissibility in all settings to improve basic preventive measures to generate sustained reductions in invasive MRSA infections. Our primary aim was to compare intraoperative transmissibility of MRSA versus methicillin-sensitive S aureus (MSSA) isolates.
Methods
S aureus isolates (N = 173) collected from 274 randomly selected operating room environments (first and second case of the day in each operating room, a case pair) at 3 hospitals underwent systematic-phenotypic and genomic processing to identify clonally related transmission events. Confirmed transmission events were defined as at least 2 S aureus isolates obtained from ≥2 distinct intraoperative reservoirs sampled within or between cases in a study unit that were epidemiologically and clonally related. We explored the relationship between clonal transmission and methicillin resistance with Poisson regression analysis.
Results
We identified 58 clonal transmission events. MRSA isolates were associated with increased risk of clonal transmission compared with MSSA isolates (adjusted incidence risk ratio [IRR], 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-2.49; P = .010; unadjusted IRR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.23-2.77; P = .003, respectively).
Conclusions
MRSA isolates are associated with increased risk of intraoperative transmission. Future work should examine the impact of the attenuation of intraoperative MRSA transmission on the incidence of invasive MRSA infections."

Effective hand hygiene prevents healthcare-associated infections. This systematic review evaluates the evidence for the World Health Organization's (WHO) technique in reducing the microbial load on the hands of healthcare workers (HCWs).
Methods
This study was conducted in accordance with Joanna Briggs Protocol 531. Index and free-text terms for technique, HCW, and microbial load were searched in CINAHL, Medline, Web of Science, Mednar, Proquest, and Google Scholar. Inclusion criteria were articles in English that evaluated the WHO 6-step hand hygiene technique for healthcare staff. Two reviewers independently performed quality assessment and data extraction.
Results
All 7 studies found that the WHO technique reduced bacterial load on HCW hands, but the strongest evidence came from 3 randomized controlled trials, which reported conflicting evidence. One study found no difference in the effectiveness of the WHO 6-step technique compared to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 3-step technique (P = .08); another study found the WHO 6-step technique to be more effective (P = .02); and the third study found that a modified 3-step technique was more effective than the 6-step technique (P = .021).
Conclusions
This review provides evidence of the effectiveness of the WHO technique but does not identify the most effective hand hygiene technique. Questions to be addressed by further research are identified. Meanwhile, current practices should continue."

The hallmark of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) disease is the ability to cause major health care-associated nosocomial outbreaks with superspreading events leading to massive numbers of cases and excessive morbidity and mortality. In this report, we describe a patient who presented with acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis and became a MERS-CoV superspreader, igniting a recent multihospital outbreak in Riyadh.
Material and Results
Between May 31 and June 15, 2017, 44 cases of MERS-CoV infection were reported from 3 simultaneous clusters from 3 health care facilities in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, including 11 fatal cases. Out of the total reported cases, 29 cases were reported from King Saud Medical City. The cluster at King Saud Medical City was ignited by a single superspreader patient who presented with acute renal failure. After 14 hours in the open area of the emergency department and 2 hemodialysis sessions he was diagnosed with MERS-CoV. One hundred twenty contacts who had direct unprotected exposure were screened. Among those contacts, 9 out of 107 health care workers (5 nurses, 3 physicians, and 1 paramedic) and 7 out of 13 patients tested positive for MERS-CoV.
Conclusions
This hospital outbreak demonstrated the difficulties in diagnosing pneumonia in patients with renal and cardiac failure, which leads to delayed suspicion of MERS-CoV and hence delay in applying the proper infection control procedures. In MERS-CoV endemic countries there is an urgent need for developing rapid point-of-care testing that would assist emergency department staff in triaging suspected cases of MERS-CoV to ensure timely isolation and management of their primary illness and prevent major MERS-CoV outbreaks."

Methods
A prospective observational study was conducted in 2 PICUs at Cairo University Hospitals to determine the incidence and outcome of GNB infections over 1 year. Variables of interest included age, gender, isolated organism, susceptibility to antibiotics, and final outcome.
Results
During the study period, 1420 patients were admitted to the PICU; of these, 291 developed GNB infections. The median age of the studied GNB patients was 50 months (interquartile range [IQR], 22-80 months). The mortality rate was 37.1%. Organisms were isolated from blood in the majority (86.6%) of patients, with Klebsiella (36.0%) being the most frequently isolated organism. Among patients with GNB infection, 235 patients, one had a multidrug-resistant (MDR) infection. The length of hospital stay was statistically significantly longer in the MDR group (25 days; IQR, 20-30) than in the non-MDR group (15 days; IQR, 10-20) (P < .01). Mortality was similar in both groups (37.4% vs 35.7% in the MDR and non-MDR groups, respectively; P = .88).

In developed countries, scabies is observed sporadically or as institutional outbreaks in hospitals and other health facilities. In the family context, outbreaks generally involve a limited number of cases.
Methods
A local health authority in Emilia-Romagna (Northern Italy) carried out an epidemiologic investigation on a family outbreak of scabies that included an unusually high number of cases. Its possible connection with a nosocomial case in a long-term care facility (LTCF) and outbreak management are discussed.
Results
Among the household members, 8 confirmed cases occurred (attack rate, 87.5%). Another case was reported in a patient of an LTCF where one of the family cases worked as a sociosanitary operator. In total, 244 contacts were placed under surveillance. The control strategy focused on a mass information campaign addressed to all contacts and the training of health care personnel. In addition, specific prophylaxis (permethrin 5%) was performed in 108 high-risk contacts and LTCF patients and staff.
Conclusions
The control measures were successful in preventing the spread of the outbreak. However, misdiagnosis and the tendency of people to hide the symptoms caused the late recognition and underestimation of the cases, contributing to delayed control measures and increasing the economic and human resources required for outbreak management."

The global burden of health care–associated infection (HAI) is well recognized; what is less well known is the impact HAI has on patients. To develop acceptable, effective interventions, greater understanding of patients' experience of HAI is needed. This qualitative systematic review sought to explore adult patients' experiences of common HAIs.
Methods
Five databases were searched. Search terms were combined for qualitative research, HAI terms, and patient experience. Study selection was conducted by 2 researchers using prespecified criteria. Critical Appraisal Skills Programme quality appraisal tools were used. Internationally recognized Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were applied. The Noblit and Hare (1988) approach to meta-synthesis was adopted.
Results
Seventeen studies (2001-2017) from 5 countries addressing 5 common types of HAI met the inclusion criteria. Four interrelated themes emerged: the continuum of physical and emotional responses, experiencing the response of health care professionals, adapting to life with an HAI, and the complex cultural context of HAI.
Conclusions
The impact of different HAIs may vary; however, there are many similarities in the experience recounted by patients. The biosociocultural context of contagion was graphically expressed, with potential impact on social relationships and professional interactions highlighted. Further research to investigate contemporary patient experience in an era of antimicrobial resistance is warranted."

Methods
The Texas Healthcare Information Collection Public Use Data File was used to investigate trends in the diagnosis of SUOs over a 5-year period from January 1, 2010-December 31, 2014.
Results
CS-associated SUOs affected 9.24 women for every 1,000 CSs. During the study period, a large decrease in the rate of SUOs occurred (R2 = 0.60). This was potentially influenced by a large decrease in the rate of endometritis (R2 = 0.41). Decreases in the diagnosis of and readmission for CS wound disruption were not as large (R2 = 0.06 and R2 = 0.03, respectively). A large increase in CS-associated sepsis (R2 = .32) was identified. Administrative coded data used to identify SUOs in this study may have utility for the identification of serious unintended outcomes associated with CS at the population level.
Conclusions
Increases in length of stay and utilization of critical care were noted among women affected by CS-associated SUOs. Additional study is needed to determine factors that increase the likelihood of the development of SUO and to evaluate the preventability of these events."

The objective of this study was to evaluate 2 commercial products for C&D effectiveness on common household surfaces in seniors' homes.
Methods
Two C&D visits were conducted in 46 seniors' homes. One visit applied a bleach-containing cleaning product and the other applied an environmentally preferable product. Before and after C&D, the study team performed organic soil bioluminometer measurements on surfaces and collected cotton swab and wipe samples for total bacteria count, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium difficile identification.
Results
Both products removed microorganisms from tested surfaces. S aureus was found in 7 households, 1 strain of which was methicillin-resistant. Both products removed S aureus from all surfaces. Bleach-containing products removed somewhat more soil than environmentally preferable products, although results were statistically significant for only 1 surface.
Conclusions
The study showed similar, not identical, C&D performance for 2 cleaning products with potentially different consequences for respiratory health. Additional research is needed to develop robust recommendations for safe, effective C&D in home care."

The objective of this study is to determine the impact of interhospital patient transfers on the risk of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI).
Methods
The number of interhospital patient transfers and CDI cases for 11 academic and 40 large community hospitals (LCHs) were available from 2010-2015. These data were used to compute a CDI score for each sending facility as a measure of CDI pressure on the receiving facility. This CDI score was included as a variable in a multilevel mixed-effect Poisson regression model of CDI cases. Other covariates included year, CDI testing strategy, antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP), and criteria used for patient isolation. Hospital-specific random effects were estimated for the baseline rate of CDI (intercept) and ASP effect (slope).
Results
The CDI score ranged from 0-103, with a mean score ± SD of 20.4 ± 21.8. Every 10-point increase in the CDI score was associated with a 4.5% increase in the incidence of CDI in the receiving academic hospital (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9-8.5) and 3.6% increase in the receiving LCHs (95% CI, 0.3-7). The random components of the model varied significantly, with a strong negative correlation of −0.85 (95% CI, −0.94 to −0.65).

Our results suggest interhospital patient transfers increase the risk of CDI. ASPs appear to reduce this risk; however, these ASP effects demonstrate significant heterogeneity across hospitals."

The recent emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases have made the knowledge and practice of standard infection control precautions in developing countries more important than ever. However, schools of nursing in Jordan do not have a prescribed curriculum in Standard Precautions.
Purpose
To test the effectiveness of using of an online education module and a learning contract on knowledge and compliance with infection control Standard Precautions among undergraduate nursing students in Jordan.
Methods
A sample of 256 undergraduate nursing students participated in an online education module in infection control Standard Precautions. A pretest–posttest design tested effectiveness using an online questionnaire (Questionnaires for Knowledge and Compliance with Standard Precautions) before and after the online instruction.
Results
Initially, subjects reported low levels of knowledge and compliance with Standard Precaution practices and relatively few (15.2%) had high scores. Compliance with Standard Precautions was somewhat better (27%). Significant differences in the mean scores of knowledge and compliance between pretest and posttest were found.
Conclusion
Online instruction offers a consistent and effective method to include Standard Precautions into nursing education. Organizations that oversee nursing in Jordan have the option to strengthen all nursing curricula by mandating a standardized infection control curricula across all schools of nursing."

Despite absence of evidence, in practice, asymptomatic bacteriuria is perceived as a risk factor for surgical site infection (SSI) among patients with cardiac surgery. We aimed to identify whether an association exists between the preoperative presence of asymptomatic bacteriuria or urinary tract infection and SSI in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery.
Methods
This is an analytical study with a retrospective cohort of patients undergoing coronary revascularization or valve replacement surgery. We identified cases of bacteriuria, urinary tract infection, and cardiovascular SSI and adjusted the results according to exposure to antibiotics and known risk factors for SSI using a multivariate logistic regression analysis.
Results
A total of 840 patients were included in the study, of whom 33 (3.9%) had asymptomatic bacteriuria and 13 (1.5%) had urinary tract infections. The incidence of SSI was 9.5% (80 patients), with 2.3% of cases having mediastinitis. In the multivariate analysis, asymptomatic bacteriuria (relative risk, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-2.56; P = .74) and urinary tract infection (relative risk, 2.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-10.69; P = .20) were not risk factors for SSI. Traditional risk factors were found to increase the risk of SSI.
Conclusions
The presence of bacteriuria is not a risk factor for presenting SSI in cardiovascular surgery. Screening with urinalysis or urine culture would not be recommended for patients undergoing cardiac surgery."

Hand hygiene plays an important role in the prevention of Clostridium difficile (CD) infection (CDI). Patient hand hygiene (PHH) may be a potentially underused preventative measure for CDI. Patient mobility and acuity along with a lack of education present obstacles to PHH for the hospitalized patient. Surveys of patients at our institution showed a need for increased PHH opportunities. The objective of this study was to increase PHH and to examine if PHH affected CDI at our hospital.
Methods
A biphasic, quasi-experimental study was performed to increase PHH through education for staff and to provide education, assistance, and opportunities to the patient for hand cleaning. PHH practice was assessed by patient surveys and analyzed by χ2 test. PHH effect on CDI was determined by following health care facility–onset CD laboratory–identified events data analyzed by National Healthcare Safety Network standardized infection ratios (SIRs).
Results
PHH opportunities improved significantly (P < .0001) after staff and patient education. CD SIRs deceased significantly for 6 months (P ≤ .05) after the PHH intervention.
Conclusions
PHH opportunities can be increased by providing education and opportunities for patients to clean their hands. PHH should be considered a relevant preventative measure for CDI in hospitalized patients."

abstract = "Background
The timely identification of a cluster is a critical requirement for infection prevention and control (IPC) departments because these events may represent transmission of pathogens within the health care setting. Given the issues with manual review of hospital infections, a surveillance system to detect clusters in health care settings must use automated data capture, validated statistical methods, and include all significant pathogens, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, patient care locations, and health care teams.
Methods
We describe the use of SaTScan statistical software to identify clusters, WHONET software to manage microbiology laboratory data, and electronic health record data to create a comprehensive outbreak detection system in our hospital. We also evaluated the system using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidelines.
Results
During an 8-month surveillance time period, 168 clusters were detected, 45 of which met criteria for investigation, and 6 were considered transmission events. The system was felt to be flexible, timely, accepted by the department and hospital, useful, and sensitive, but it required significant resources and has a low positive predictive value.
Conclusions
WHONET-SaTScan is a useful addition to a robust IPC program. Although the resources required were significant, this prospective, real-time cluster detection surveillance system represents an improvement over historical methods. We detected several episodes of transmission which would have eluded us previously, and allowed us to focus infection prevention efforts and improve patient safety."

Cost-effectiveness analyses are an important methodology in assessing whether a health care technology is suitable for widespread adoption. Common models used by economists, such as decision trees and Markov models, are appropriate for noninfectious diseases where treatment and exposure are independent. Diseases whose treatment and exposure are dependent require dynamic models to incorporate the nonlinear transmission effect. Two different types of models are often used for dynamic cost-effectiveness analyses: compartmental models and individual models. In this methodology-focused literature review, we describe each model type and summarize the literature associated with each using the example of health care-associated infections (HAIs).
Methods
We conducted a review of the literature to identify dynamic cost-effectiveness analyses that examined interventions to prevent or treat HAIs. To be included in the review, studies needed to have each of 3 necessary components: involve economics, such as cost-effectiveness analysis and evidence of economic theory, use a dynamic transmission model, and examine HAIs.
Results
Of the 9 articles published between 2005 and 2016 that met criteria to be included in our study, 3 used compartmental models and 6 used individual models.
Conclusions
Very few published studies exist that use dynamic transmission models to conduct economic analyses related to HAIs and even fewer studies have used these models to perform cost-effectiveness analyses."

Little is known about the direct economic burden associated with health care–associated infection (HAI) in patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery in China. This study aims to fill this knowledge gap.
Methods
This study was a prospective monitoring case-control study. The direct economic burden was presented as the median of the 1:1 pair differences of various hospitalization fees and hospital length of stay. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to explore the differences in the direct economic burden.
Results
Out of 448 patients, 38 had acquired HAIs, with the infection incidence being 8.93%. The total direct economic burden of HAIs was $1,589.30 (P < .05). Among various infection sites, deep surgical site infection had the highest direct economic burden of $8,654.44, followed by multisite infections ($5,946.52). When it comes to various hospitalization costs, the cost for Western medicine ($846.13) constituted the highest proportion of economic burden followed by treatment cost ($145.73) and bed charge ($126.75). On average, the length of hospital stay in the infection group was 6 days longer than that in the control group (P < .05).

There has been an increased focus in recent years on antimicrobial resistance of bacteria isolated from clinical samples. However, resistance of bacteria from hospital environments has been less frequently investigated.
Methods
According to hygienic standard for disinfection in hospitals, samples were collected from hospital inanimate surfaces and the hands of health care workers after daily cleaning. An automatic microorganism analyzer was used to identify bacteria and test for antimicrobial susceptibility. Polymerase chain reaction was used to detect antimicrobial resistance genes.
Results
The detection rate of bacteria in general wards was significantly higher than that in intensive care units. The isolates were predominantly gram-negative (GN) bacteria, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae being the most common. P aeruginosa isolates from other surfaces were much higher than those from medical instruments. E cloacae was isolated more frequently from the hands of other staff than medical staff. Most P aeruginosa and K pneumoniae were resistant to sulfonamides and β-lactam antimicrobials. Only 1 strain of P aeruginosa and 1 strain of K pneumoniae showed multiple antimicrobials resistance.
Conclusions
The GN bacteria isolated from hospital environments demonstrate variable resistance to antimicrobials."

abstract = "Background
Surveillance of health care–associated infections (HAIs) plays a key role in the hospital infection control program and reduction of HAIs. In India, most of the surveillance of HAIs is reported from private sector hospitals that do not depict the situation of government sector hospitals. Other studies do not confirm with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) surveillance criterion, or deal with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) instead of ventilator-associated event (VAE). The aim of this study was to identify the incidences of 3 device-associated HAIs (DA-HAIs) (VAE, central line–associated bloodstream infection [CLABSI], and catheter-associated urinary tract infection [CAUTI]) by active surveillance using CDC's NHSN surveillance criteria and to identify the pathogens associated with these DA-HAIs.
Methods
This was a prospective surveillance study (January 2015-December 2016) conducted in an intensive care unit (ICU) of a large, tertiary care, government hospital situated in Delhi, India. Targeted surveillance was done as per the CDC's NHSN 2016 surveillance criteria.
Results
There were 343 patients admitted to the ICU that were included in the study. The surveillance data was reported over 3,755 patient days. A DA-HAIs attack rate of 20.1 per 100 admissions and incidence of 18.3 per 1,000 patient days was observed. The duration of use for each device for patients with DA-HAIs was significantly longer than for patients without DA-HAIs. The device utilization ratios of central line, ventilator, and urinary catheters were 0.57, 0.85, and 0.72, respectively. The crude excess length of stay for patients with DA-HAI was 13 days, and crude excess mortality rate was 11.8%. VAE, CLABSI, and CAUTI rates were 11.8, 7.4, and 9.7 per 1,000 device days, respectively. Among 69 DA-HAIs reported, pathogens could be identified for 49 DA-HAI cases. Klebsiella spp was the most common organism isolated, accounting 28.5% for all DA-HAI cases, followed by Enterococcus spp (24.4%). The most common organisms causing VAE, CAUTI, and CLABSI were Acinetobacter (6/15, 40%), Enterococcus spp (11/31, 35.4%), and Candida spp (5/19, 26.3%), respectively. Most of the gram-negative organisms were carbapenem resistant; however, none of the isolates were colistin resistant.
Conclusions
To reduce the risk of infection in hospitalized patients, DA-HAI surveillance is of primary importance because it effectively describes and addresses the importance and characteristics of the threatening situation created by DA-HAIs. The present surveillance shows high rates of ICU-onset DA-HAIs and high resistance patterns of organisms causing HAIs, representing a major risk to patient safety."

Neonatal sepsis is the most frequent health care-associated infection in neonatal units. This study aimed to analyze articles on the clinical usefulness of catheter-drawn blood samples and catheter tip cultures for the diagnosis of intravascular catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) in neonates.
Methods
A systematic search was performed for studies published from 1987-2017, without language restriction. Observational studies carried out in neonates with CRBSI diagnosed using catheter-drawn blood samples or catheter tip cultures were included.
Results
A total of 412 articles were identified in the databases and 10 articles were included. The 7 studies that evaluated central venous catheter tip cultures and cultures of catheter fragments presented sensitivities ranging from 58.5%-100% and specificities ranging from 60%-95.7%. Three studies that evaluated catheter-drawn blood cultures, paired with peripheral blood cultures, reported sensitivity and specificity of 94% and 71% when evaluated for the differential time to positivity. When quantitative evaluation was performed, the sensitivity and specificity were 80% and 99.4%.
Conclusions
Most of the studies analyzed cultures from the central venous catheter tip and catheter fragments for the diagnosis of CRBSI in neonatal populations. The results of this review suggest that the analysis of the catheter-drawn blood samples and catheter tip cultures, paired with peripheral blood cultures, are efficient methods for the diagnosis of CRBSI in neonates."

Nonventilator hospital-acquired pneumonia (NV-HAP) is among the most common hospital-acquired infections. The purpose of our study was to quantify the incidence and influence of NV-HAP in the United States using a national dataset.
Methods
The 2012 US National Inpatient Sample dataset was used to compare an NV-HAP group to 4 additional group cohorts: pneumonia on admission, general hospital admissions, matched on mortality and disease severity, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The main outcome was NV-HAP incidence. The secondary outcome was to compare hospital length of stay, total hospital charges, and mortality between the NV-HAP group and the 4 additional group cohorts.
Results
The overall incidence of NV-HAP was 1.6%, which represents a rate of 3.63 per 1,000 patient-days. NV-HAP was associated with increased total hospital charges, a longer hospital length of stay, and greater likelihood of death in comparison to all groups except patients with VAP.
Conclusion
NV-HAP is an underappreciated and serious patient safety issue, resulting in significant increases in cost, length of stay, and mortality. Efforts toward prevention of NV-HAP should be raised to the same level of concern as VAP prevention."

Contact tracing is the systematic method of identifying individuals potentially exposed to infectious diseases. Electronic medical record (EMR) use for contact tracing is time-consuming and may miss exposed individuals. Real-time location systems (RTLSs) may improve contact identification. Therefore, the relative effectiveness of these 2 contact tracing methodologies were evaluated.
Methods
During a pertussis outbreak in the United States, a retrospective case study was conducted between June 14 and August 31, 2016, to identify the contacts of confirmed pertussis cases, using EMR and RTLS data in the emergency department of a tertiary care medical center. Descriptive statistics and a paired t test (α = 0.05) were performed to compare contacts identified by EMR versus RTLS, as was correlation between pertussis patient length of stay and the number of potential contacts.
Results
Nine cases of pertussis presented to the emergency department during the identified time period. RTLS doubled the potential exposure list (P < .01). Length of stay had significant positive correlation with contacts identified by RTLS (ρ = 0.79; P = .01) but not with EMR (ρ = 0.43; P = .25).
Conclusions
RTLS doubled the potential pertussis exposures beyond EMR-based contact identification. Thus, RTLS may be a valuable addition to the practice of contact tracing and infectious disease monitoring."

Five half-mask elastomeric respirator models and 3 powered air-purifying respirator models were contaminated with influenza virus and artificial skin oil on multiple surfaces. RPDs were then manually treated with 1 of 2 methods: cleaned or cleaned and disinfected. Presence of viable influenza was determined via swab sampling and a median tissue culture infectious dose assay.
Results
Across 41 RPD surfaces, a mean log reduction in viable influenza of 4.54 ± 0.97 log10 median tissue culture infectious dose was achieved for all treated surfaces, which included both cleaned and cleaned and disinfected surfaces.
Conclusions
The methods defined as part of this study are effective for eliminating viable influenza in the presence of artificial skin oil on most of the RPD surfaces tested. Material type and RPD design should be considered when implementing RPD reprocessing protocols."

We sought to determine hospital length of stay (LOS) and cost burden associated with hospital admissions among pregnant women with HIV monoinfection, tuberculosis (TB) monoinfection, or HIV-TB coinfection in the United States.
Methods
Analysis covered the period from 2002-2014 using data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Relevant ICD-9-CM codes were used to determine HIV and TB status. Costs associated with hospitalization were calculated and adjusted to 2010 dollars using the medical care component of the Consumer Price Index.
Results
We found modest annual average reduction in HIV, TB, and HIV-TB coinfection rates over the study period. The mean LOS was lowest among mothers free of HIV or TB disease and highest among those with HIV-TB coinfection. The average LOS among mothers diagnosed with TB monoinfection was 60% higher than for those with HIV monoinfection. The cost associated with pregnancy-related hospital admissions among mothers with HIV was approximately 30% higher than disease-free mothers, and the cost more than doubled among patients with TB monoinfection or HIV-TB coinfection.

Non-sterile gloves primarily serve as a barrier protection for health care workers (HCWs). However, pathogens may often contaminate the skin of HCWs during glove removal; therefore, pathogens may be further transmitted and cause nosocomial infections.
Methods
A field study was conducted comparing contamination rates when using standard gloves or a new modified product equipped with an additional flap (doffing aid) for easier removal. Gloves were removed after bathing gloved hands in an artificial fluorescent lotion. The number of contamination spots was then visually examined using ultraviolet light.
Results
There were 317 individuals who participated in this study: 146 participants (104 nurses and 42 physicians) used standard gloves, whereas 171 participants (118 nurses and 53 physicians) used the modified product. Use of the modified gloves instead of the standard product (15.8% vs 73.3%, respectively; P < .001) and being a physician rather than a nurse (29.5% vs 47.7%, respectively; P = .003) were the only independent risk factors for reduction of contamination.
Conclusions
This study shows that the modified product could, at least in vitro, significantly reduce the rate of hand and wrist contamination during removal compared with standard gloves. By this, it may significantly improve the overall quality of patient care when used on the wards directly at the patient's site."

abstract = "Background
This report describes a double outbreak of OXA-48–producing Enterobacteriaceae (OXA-48-PE) and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MRAB) in an intensive care unit (ICU) and the effectiveness of measures implemented, including decontamination with vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP).
Methods
Affected patients were isolated in a confined area and cared for by dedicated personnel. Four percent chlorhexidine soap was used for patient daily hygiene. All patients are subjected to contact precautions. An in-depth cleaning of the ICU was performed with a chlorine solution, followed by decontamination with VHP. Environmental samples were taken before and after the decontamination.
Results
From July-October 2015, 13 patients were colonized or infected by OXA-48-PE and 18 by MRAB in the ICU. The cumulative incidence of OXA-48-PE and MRAB was 3.48% and 4.81%, respectively. In the period after the intervention, they were 0.8% and 0%, respectively (P < .001). Before the VHP biodecontamination, 4.5% of environmental samples were positive for OXA-48-PE and none for MRAB. After biodecontamination, 1.4% of samples were positive for OXA-48-PE.
Conclusions
This study emphasizes the importance of environmental hygiene in the control of outbreaks caused by microorganisms of high environmental impact. The rapid effect after the VHP treatment suggests an influence of this measure in eradication."

abstract = "Background
Many outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have occurred in health care settings and involved health care workers (HCWs). We describe the occurrence of an outbreak among HCWs and attempt to characterize at-risk exposures to improve future infection control interventions.
Methods
This study included an index case and all HCW contacts. All contacts were screened for MERS-CoV using polymerase chain reaction.
Results
During the study period in 2015, the index case was a 30-year-old Filipino nurse who had a history of unprotected exposure to a MERS-CoV–positive case on May 15, 2015, and had multiple negative tests for MERS-CoV. Weeks later, she was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis and MERS-CoV infection. A total of 73 staff were quarantined for 14 days, and nasopharyngeal swabs were taken on days 2, 5, and 12 postexposure. Of those contacts, 3 (4%) were confirmed positive for MERS-CoV. An additional 18 staff were quarantined and had MERS-CoV swabs. A fourth case was confirmed positive on day 12. Subsequent contact investigations revealed a fourth-generation transmission. Only 7 (4.5%) of the total 153 contacts were positive for MERS-CoV.
Conclusions
The role of HCWs in MERS-CoV transmission is complex. Although most MERS-CoV–infected HCWs are asymptomatic or have mild disease, fatal infections can occur and HCWs can play a major role in propagating health care facility outbreaks. This investigation highlights the need to continuously review infection control guidance relating to the role of HCWs in MERS-CoV transmission in health care outbreaks, especially as it relates to the complex questions on definition of risky exposures, who to test, and the frequency of MERS-CoV testing; criteria for who to quarantine and for how long; and clearance and return to active duty criteria."

Health care–associated infections (HAIs) are largely preventable, but are associated with considerable health care burden. Given the significant cost of HAIs, many health care institutions have implemented bundled interventions to reduce HAIs. These complex behavioral interventions require considerable effort; however, individual behaviors and motivations crucial to successful and sustained implementation have not been adequately assessed. We evaluated health care worker motivations to reduce HAIs.
Methods
This was a phenomenologic qualitative study of health care workers in different roles within a university hospital, recruited via a snowball strategy. Using constructs from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research model, face-to-face semi-structured interviews were used to explore perceptions of health care worker motivation to follow protocols on HAI prevention.
Results
Across all types of health care workers interviewed, patient safety and improvement in clinical outcomes were the major motivators to reducing HAIs. Other important motivators included collaborative environment that valued individual input, transparency and feedback at both organizational and individual levels, leadership involvement, and refresher trainings and workshops. We did not find policy, regulatory considerations, or financial penalties to be important motivators.
Conclusions
Health care workers perceived patient safety and clinical outcomes as the primary motivators to reduce HAI. Leadership engagement and data-driven interventions with frequent performance feedback were also identified as important facilitators of HAI prevention."

The use of gloves for every patient contact (ie, universal gloving) has been suggested as an infection prevention adjunct and alternative to contact precautions. However, gloves may carry organisms unless they are changed properly. In addition, hand hygiene is required before donning and after removing gloves, and there are scarce data regarding glove changing and hand hygiene in a universal gloving setting.
Methods
This nonrandomized observational before-after study evaluated the effect of education and feedback regarding hand hygiene. Compliance with hand hygiene and glove use was directly observed in a universal gloving setting at a 10-bed intensive care unit in a Japanese tertiary care university teaching hospital.
Results
A total of 6,050 hand hygiene opportunities were identified. Overall, hand hygiene compliance steadily increased from study period 1 (16.1%) to period 5 (56.8%), although there were indication-specific differences in the baseline compliance, the degree of improvement, and the reasons for noncompliance. There were decreases in the compliance with universal gloving and the incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Conclusion
It is difficult to properly perform glove use and hand hygiene in a universal gloving setting, given its complexity. Direct observation with specific feedback and education may be effective in improving compliance."

The recent Ebola outbreak led to the development of Ebola virus disease (EVD) best practices in clinical settings. However, after the care of EVD patients, proper medical waste management and disposal was identified as a crucial component to containing the virus. Category A waste—contaminated with EVD and other highly infectious pathogens—is strictly regulated by governmental agencies, and led to only several facilities willing to accept the waste.
Methods
A pilot survey was administered to determine if U.S. medical waste facilities are prepared to handle or transport category A waste, and to determine waste workers' current extent of training to handle highly infectious waste.
Results
Sixty-eight percent of survey respondents indicated they had not determined if their facility would accept category A waste. Of those that had acquired a special permit, 67% had yet to modify their permit since the EVD outbreak. This pilot survey underscores gaps in the medical waste industry to handle and respond to category A waste. Furthermore, this study affirms reports a limited number of processing facilities are capable or willing to accept category A waste.
Conclusions
Developing the proper management of infectious disease materials is essential to close the gaps identified so that states and governmental entities can act accordingly based on the regulations and guidance developed, and to ensure public safety."

Although extensive varicella vaccination coverage has been reported in many countries, breakthrough varicella (BV) still occurs in healthy children. We performed a meta-analysis to understand whether 2 varicella vaccine doses are needed in children and, if so, to determine the best time to vaccinate.
Methods
The BV incidence rates after 1 or 2 doses of varicella vaccine were pooled using random effects, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to estimate the risk factors after vaccination.
Results
A total of 27 original articles were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled average BV incidence rate in children vaccinated with 1 dose was 8.5 cases per 1,000 person years (PY) (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.3-13.7; random effects model) and 2.2 cases per 1,000 PY (95% CI, 0.5-9.3; random effects model) in children vaccinated with 2 doses. The pooled trend of the annual BV incidence rate from the first to eighth year fluctuated, with a peak annual incidence rate of 35.3 cases per 1,000 population in the fourth year. The meta-regression showed that design type, type of vaccine, and their interaction accounted for approximately 71.74% of the heterogeneity in the average BV incidence rate after 1 vaccine dose.
Conclusions
Two doses of varicella vaccine are more effective than a single dose, and 3-4 years between the first and second vaccinations may achieve higher efficacy."

Surgical antibiotic prophylaxis (SAP) is a critical area to optimize to reduce the escalation of antimicrobial resistance. This article explores the ways by which interpersonal relationships influence SAP decision making.
Methods
Twenty surgeons and anesthetists participated in in-depth semistructured interviews on SAP prescribing. Results were analyzed using the framework approach.
Results
Analysis revealed 3 ways by which interpersonal relationships influence SAP: relationship dynamics between the surgeon and the anesthetist determine appropriateness of SAP, particularly operative risk ownership; perceived hierarchies within, and between, surgical and anesthetist specialties influence antibiotic prescribing decisions; and surgical distance from the antimicrobial stewardship team, which influences use of antimicrobial stewardship principles.
Conclusions
Interventions to optimize SAP are more likely to be effective in enacting sustained change if they consider the interpersonal and social contexts, including issues of familiarity and cohesiveness, hierarchical patterns, and sense of place within a team. Significant relational dynamics in SAP decision making are centered around risk; that is, personal/reputational risk to different professional groups and ownership of risk for individual patient outcomes. Risk must therefore be considered for sustainable SAP optimization interventions."

The World Health Organization seeks to achieve the goal of viral hepatitis elimination by 2030 and lack of general knowledge about viral hepatitis seems to be a barrier to reaching this goal. This study was designed to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) regarding hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections among Iranian health sciences students in 12 Iranian medical sciences universities using a national survey.
Methods
This survey was conducted during the second Hepatitis Awareness Campaign, which was held during the Iranian National Hepatitis Week (October 22-28, 2016). Students who visited our booths and were willing to participate in our survey were selected using convenience sampling and their HBV- and HCV-related KAP were evaluated.
Results
Two thousand one hundred fifty-six health sciences students with mean age of 21.24 years participated in our survey. The mean KAP scores were 7.35 (out of 10), 4.88 (possible score, –20 to +20), and 5.67 (out of 9). Students with experience of accidental exposures to blood (21.6%) had better KAP scores compared with the students without such experiences. The mean KAP scores were associated with subjects' year of education, field of study, university, and province (P < .05).
Conclusions
Our study showed that HBV- and HCV-related KAP in a sample of Iranian health sciences students was not satisfying. The results also demonstrated priority of needing intervention regarding KAP in some subject areas, lower years of education, and some universities compared with others."

Methods
Newly diagnosed CRGN infections in hospitalized children younger than age 18 years were prospectively recorded and all patients infected with a CSGN pathogen in the same unit within 48 hours of diagnosis were included in a control group between April 1, 2014, and December 31, 2014.
Results
Twenty-seven patients with CRGN infections and 28 patients with CSGN infections were enrolled in this study. Ventilator-associated pneumonia was the most common type of infection in both groups. Prior exposure to carbapenems (relative risk [RR], 11.368; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.311-98.589), prolonged hospitalization (RR, 5.100; 95% CI, 1.601-16.242) were found to be independent risk factors for acquiring CRGN infections. Septic shock was significantly more frequent in the CRGN group (RR, 9.450; 95% CI, 1.075-83.065). The in-hospital mortality was higher in the CRGN group (RR, 7.647; 95% CI, 1.488-39.290).

Surgical site infection (SSI) is a common complication in spinal surgery, imposing a high burden on patients and society. However, information about its characteristics and related risk factors is limited. We designed this prospective, multicenter study to address this issue.
Methods
: From January 2015 through February 2016, a total of 1764 patients who had spinal trauma or degenerative spinal diseases were treated with instrumented surgeries and followed up for 1 year with complete data. Data on all patients were abstracted from electronic medical records, and SSIs were prospectively inspected and diagnosed by surgeons in our department. Any disagreement among them was settled by the leader of this study. SPSS 19.0 was used to perform the analyses.
Results
A total of 58 patients (3.3%, 58 of 1764) developed SSI; 1.1% had deep SSI, and 2.2% had superficial SSI. Of these, 60.6% (21 of 33) had a polymicrobial cause. Most of them (51 of 58) occurred during hospitalization. The median occurrence time was 3 days after operation (range: 1–123 days). SSI significantly prolonged hospital stays, by 9.3 days on average. The univariate analysis revealed reason for surgery as the only significant risk factor. The multivariate analysis, however, revealed 8 significant risk factors, including higher BMI, surgical site (cervical), surgical approach (posterior), surgery performed in summer, reasons for surgery (degenerative disease), autograft for fusion and fixation, and higher preoperative platelet level.
Conclusion
Identification of these risk factors aids in stratifying preoperative risk to reduce SSI incidence. In addition, the results could be used in counseling patients and their families during the consent process."

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) occurs frequently in inpatient settings; however, community-onset cases have been reported more frequently in recent years. This study evaluated hospital-onset and community-onset CDI in the national Veterans Health Administration (VHA) population over a 12-year period.
Methods
This was a retrospective cohort study of all adult VHA beneficiaries with CDI between October 1, 2002, and September 30, 2014. Data were obtained from the Veterans Affairs Informatics and Computing Infrastructure. CDI was categorized into community-associated CDI (CA-CDI); community-onset, health care facility-associated CDI; and health care facility-onset CDI (HCFO-CDI). Each type was described longitudinally and was assessed as an independent risk factor for health outcomes using multivariable logistic regression.
Results
Overall, 30,326 patients with a first CDI episode were included. HCFO-CDI was the predominant type (60.2%), followed by CO-HCFA-CDI (20.6%) and CA-CDI (19.2%). The proportion of patients with HCFO-CDI decreased from 73.5% during fiscal year 2003 to 53.2% during fiscal year 2014, whereas CA-CDI increased from 8.3% to 26.7%.

Reducing health care-associated infections (HAIs), such as catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), is a critical performance improvement target in nursing homes. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Safety Program for Long-term Care: Health Care-Associated Infections/Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection, a national performance improvement program, was designed to promote implementation of a CAUTI prevention program through state-based or regional collaboratives in more than 500 nursing homes across the United States.
Methods
Qualitative interviews were conducted with 8 purposefully selected organizational leads (who led implementation activities for a group of facilities) and 8 facility leads (who led implementation activities at a given facility) to understand implementation successes and challenges and experiences of participants involved in the program. Key themes were identified using a rapid analysis approach.
Results
Key themes related to general perceptions, changes due to program participation, and factors influencing program implementation were identified. In general, the program was viewed positively by organizational and facility leads with changes in catheter care practices, staff empowerment, and improvements in knowledge identified as benefits. Implementation challenges included the time required for program start-up as well as issues with staff and physician support, logistic barriers, and staffing turnover.
Conclusions
Despite some challenges, the observed program success and positive views of those participating suggest that collaboratives are an important strategy for providing nursing homes with enhanced expertise and support to prevent HAIs and ensure resident safety."

abstract = "Background
National blood exposure (BE) surveys are valuable to health care facilities striving to reduce percutaneous sharps injuries (SIs) or mucocutaneous (MC) exposures among their health care workers (HCWs). In the Exposure Survey of Trends in Occupational Practice (EXPO-S.T.O.P.) 2015 we surveyed hospital BE incidence among members of the Association of Occupational Health Professionals in Healthcare.
Methods
A 23-item electronic survey requested 2015 data on total SI and MC; SI in nurses, doctors, and surgery; staffed beds; teaching status; full time equivalent staff (FTE), nurse FTE, average daily census (ADC), and adjusted patient days (APD).
Results
One hundred eighty-one hospitals in 34 states reported 9,343 BE (71% SI and 29% MC exposures). SI rates were 25.2/100 ADC (17.5 in nonteaching hospitals and 30.4 in teaching hospitals), 2.1/100 FTE (significantly less than that in 2001), 3.2/100 nurse FTE, 0.36/1,000 APD, and 38% occurred during surgery. MC exposure incidence rates were 10.5/100 ADC (8.6 in nonteaching hospitals and 11.7 in teaching hospitals), 0.86/100 FTE, and 0.14/1000 APD.
Conclusions
BE incidence rates have fallen slowly but significantly since 2001, but the reduction is far less than hoped. Occupied beds (ie, ADC) has become a less-useful denominator. We estimate more than 300,000 HCWs sustain SIs annually in hospital and nonhospital settings. Greater resources are needed for more frequent and correct use of safety devices, training to competency, and root-cause investigation of all SIs."

Surgical site infections are common, especially in developing countries. Nevertheless, up to 60% of surgical site infections can be prevented with appropriate perioperative care, which includes among other measures using suitable surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis (SAP).
Methods
After a short interview with patients and retrospective review of medical charts, compliance with 6 SAP parameters was assessed for appropriateness; those parameters are indication, choice, dose, time of administration, intraoperative redosing interval, and duration of prophylaxis in 1,173 operations.
Results
Overall compliance was poor; nevertheless, certain components showed high compliance rates, such as indication and choice of antibiotics. The most frequent error noted was extended administration of prophylactic antibiotics, which was observed in 88.2% of the study population. Emergency operations were associated with a lower risk of noncompliance in administering the correct dose at the correct time (odds ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.47-0.83 and odds ratio, 0.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.3, respectively). On the other hand, women who underwent an emergency operation were associated with a 6-fold higher risk of receiving prophylactic therapy following surgery.
Conclusions
The present study demonstrated the existence of a surprisingly low level of overall compliance with the hospital-adapted SAP guidelines. Factors implicated in noncompliance were investigated, and the present results create a starting point to improve the current practice."

Neurosurgical site infection (SSI) is a complication related to craniotomy, which may lead to severe morbidity and higher hospital costs during the postoperative period.
Methods
Retrospective cohorts, case-control studies, or prospective investigations addressing risk factors of SSI updated until January 2017 were systematically searched in 2 databases (PubMed and Embase). The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate quality of the included studies, heterogeneity was assessed by I2 tests, and a funnel plot and Egger test were used for the evaluation of publication bias.
Results
There were 26 studies in total enrolled in this review. The results showed that the risk factors which had relation with SSI were other infection (odds ratio [OR], 5.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.8-10.49), number of operations (>1) (OR, 2.352; 95% CI, 1.142-4.847), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak (OR, 7.817; 95% CI, 2.573-23.751), CSF drainage (OR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.58-4.11), duration of operation (>4 hours) (as for retrospective cohort studies) (OR, 1.766; 95% CI, 1.110-2.809), venous sinus entry (OR, 4.015; 95% CI, 1.468-10.982), American Society of Anesthesiologists score (>2) (OR, 1.398; 95% CI, 1.098-1.78), sex (male) (as for prospective investigations) (OR, 1.474; 95% CI, 1.013-2.145), and surgical reasons (nontraumatic) (OR, 2.137; 95% CI, 1.106-4.129).
Conclusions
According to the current analysis, all the factors mentioned were the risk factors for SSI after craniotomy. Patients with these risk factors should be paid more attention to prevent SSI. More evidence provided by high-quality studies is still needed to further investigate the risk factors of SSI."

Health care–associated infections (HAIs) are a public health problem that increase health care costs. This article aimed to systematically review the literature and meta-analyze studies investigating risk factors (RFs) independently associated with HAIs in hospitalized adults.
Methods
Electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS) were searched to identify studies from 2009-2016. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) or odds ratios (ORs) or mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and compared across the groups. This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement.
Results
Of 867 studies, 65 met the criteria for review, and the data of 18 were summarized in the meta-analysis. The major RFs independently associated with HAIs were diabetes mellitus (RR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.27-2.44), immunosuppression (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.04-1.47), body temperature (MD, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.41-0.83), surgery time in minutes (MD, 34.53; 95% CI, 22.17-46.89), reoperation (RR, 7.94; 95% CI, 5.49-11.48), cephalosporin exposure (RR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.30-2.42), days of exposure to central venous catheter (MD, 5.20; 95% CI, 4.91-5.48), intensive care unit (ICU) admission (RR, 3.76; 95% CI, 1.79-7.92), ICU stay in days (MD, 21.30; 95% CI, 19.81-22.79), and mechanical ventilation (OR, 12.95; 95% CI, 6.28-26.73).
Conclusions
Identifying RFs that contribute to develop HAIs may support the implementation of strategies for their prevention, therefore maximizing patient safety."

abstract = "Background
The objective of the study was to assess health care providers' (HCPs) knowledge and attitude toward antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and implement an antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) in a long-term acute care hospital (LTACH).
Methods
A questionnaire on antibiotic use and resistance was administered to HCP in an LTACH in Detroit, Michigan, between August 2011 and October 2011. Concurrently, a retrospective review of common antibiotic prescription practices and costs was conducted. Then, a tailored ASP was launched at the LTACH followed by 2-phase postimplementation assessment aiming at evaluating the impact of the ASP on antibiotic expenditure.
Results
Of all respondents (N = 26), 65% viewed AMR as a national problem, but only 38% perceived AMR as a problem at their facility. Most respondents were familiar with infections caused by resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and extended-spectrum β-lactamase; however, only 35% expressed confidence in treating infected patients. In the preimplementation phase, 15% of antimicrobial doses were inappropriate and 10 of 13 de-escalation opportunities were missed, resulting in additional $23,524.00 expenditure. In the first postimplementation phase, there was a 42% and 58% decrease in the use of daptomycin and tigecycline, respectively, resulting in $55,000 savings. In the second postintervention phase, total antimicrobial cost for treating a cohort of 28 patients in 2016 and 2017 was $26,837.85 and $22,397.15, respectively.
Conclusions
Introduction of an ASP in an LTACH improves antimicrobial prescribing practices, reduces cost, and is sustainable."

Residents in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are increasingly found to be an important reservoir of multidrug-resistant gram-negative (MRGN) bacteria.
Aims
We aimed to determine colonization by MRGN bacteria over 6 months in LTCFs and geriatric wards in Graz, Austria, and to evaluate risk factors for such colonization.
Methods
During August 2015, we conducted a point-prevalence survey at LTCFs and geriatric wards of the Geriatric Health Centers of the City of Graz. Inguinal and perianal swabs were taken from 137 patients and screened for MRGN using standard procedures. Six months after the initial investigation all colonized patients were sampled again and use of antibiotics, hospital admissions, and mortality was registered. Genetic relatedness of MRGN bacteria was evaluated.
Results
We detected 12 patients harboring MRGN isolates (prevalence, 8.7%). Overall inguinal colonization was 5.1%. After 6 months, only 2 out of 12 patients were still colonized. Presence of a urinary catheter was associated with a higher risk of MRGN colonization (odds ratio [OR], 17.5; 95% CI, 1.6-192). Chronic wounds and gastrostomy were also risk factors of MRGN colonization (OR, 10.7; 95% CI, 1.6-69.3 and OR, 18.3; 95% CI, 2.4-139.4, respectively). There was no difference in mortality between colonized and noncolonized patients.
Conclusions
Prevalence of colonization with MRGN bacteria was low in patients in LTCFs and geriatric wards in Graz, Austria."

abstract = "Background
The east-to-west spread of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) represents an opportunity to explore strategies to limit spread in nonendemic areas. We evaluated CRE emergence and regional support for containment strategies.
Methods
A 17-question cross-sectional survey was administered to infection prevention programs in Orange County, CA (31 hospitals serving 3 million residents), between January and September 2014. Questions addressed newly detected hospital- and community-onset CRE cultures (2008-2013), current CRE control strategies, and support for prevention strategies for a hypothetical regional intervention.
Results
Among 31 hospitals, 21 (68%, representing 17 infection prevention programs) completed the survey. CRE was scarcely detected between 2009-2010; within 4 years, 90% of hospitals reported CRE, with 2.5-fold higher community-onset than hospital-onset CRE. Between 2011 and 2013, annual CRE incidence increased 4.7-fold (1.4-6.3 cases/10,000 admissions). Support for a regional CRE prevention bundle was unanimous. Although 22% bathed patients positive for CRE with chlorhexidine gluconate and 11% actively screened for CRE, 86% and 57%, respectively, would consider these strategies in a regional intervention.
Conclusions
CRE epidemiology in Orange County parallels early progression previously seen in now-endemic areas, representing an opportunity to consider interventions to prevent endemic spread. Many facilities would consider proactive strategies, such as chlorhexidine bathing, in the setting of a regional collaborative."

Because nonventilator hospital-acquired pneumonia (NV-HAP) is understudied, our purpose was to determine the incidence, overall burden, and level of documented pneumonia preventive interventions of NV-HAP in 24 U.S. hospitals.
Methods
This retrospective chart review extracted NV-HAP cases as per the 2014 ICD-9-CM codes for pneumonia not present on admission and the 2013 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case definition. Patient demographic data, outcomes, and documented preventive interventions were also collected.
Results
We found 1,300 NV-HAP patients who acquired NV-HAP (rate, 0.12-2.28 per 1,000 patient days) across the 21 hospitals that completed the data collection. Most NV-HAP infections (70.8%) were acquired outside of intensive care units (ICUs); 18.8% required transfer into the ICU. In the 24 hours prior to diagnosis, most of the patients did not have fundamental hospital care associated with pneumonia prevention.
Conclusions
This multicenter, nationwide study highlights the significant burden of NV-HAP in the U.S. acute care hospital setting. We found that NV-HAP occurred on every hospital unit, including in younger, healthy patients. This indicates that although some patients are clearly at higher risk, all patients carry some NV-HAP risk. Therapeutic interventions aimed at NV-HAP prevention are frequently not provided for patients in acute care hospitals."

Good hand hygiene (HH) prevents health care-associated infections. We compared psychosocial and organizational factors associated with HH compliance and perceived need for improvement among physicians, nurses, and allied health professionals (AHPs).
Methods
We conducted a mixed-methods study in a 1,600-bed adult tertiary-care hospital in Singapore. Seven focus group discussions were conducted and data were analyzed using thematic analysis. The subsequent cross-sectional survey involved 1,064 staff members. Principal components analysis was performed to derive the latent factor structure that was applied in multivariable analyses.
Results
All staff members acknowledged that HH was an integral part of their work, but were noncompliant due to competing priorities. Physicians were forgetful but appreciated reminders. Nurses were intrinsically motivated for HH. After adjusting for gender, staff category, seniority, and dermatitis history, having positive knowledge-attitudes-behaviors (odds ratio [OR], 1.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-1.69), personal motivators-enablers (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.38-1.86), and emotional motivators (OR, 1.62; 95% CI 1.40-1.88) were positively associated with good HH compliance.

Clinical findings have shown effectiveness and safety of selective digestive decontamination (SDD) for eradication of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) in high-risk carriers. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of SDD guided by CRE surveillance in the intensive care unit (ICU).
Methods
Outcomes of surveillance-guided SDD (test-guided SDD) and no screening (control) in the ICU were compared by Markov model simulations. Model outcomes were CRE infection and mortality rates, direct costs, and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) loss. Model inputs were estimated from clinical literature. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the robustness of base case results.
Results
Test-guided SDD reduced infection (4.8% vs 5.0%) and mortality (1.8% vs 2.1%) rates at a higher cost ($1,102 vs $1,074) than the control group in base case analysis, respectively. Incremental cost per QALY saved (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER]) by the test-guided SDD group was $557 per QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that test-guided SDD was effective in saving QALYs in 100% of 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations, and cost-saving 59.1% of time. The remaining 40.9% of simulations found SDD to be effective at an additional cost, with ICERs accepted as cost-effective per the willingness-to-pay threshold.
Conclusions
Surveillance-guided SDD appears to be cost-effective in reducing CRE infection and mortality with QALYs saved."

A multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was developed that targeted 6 bacteria genes that were amplified in 3 mixes. The method was validated by interlaboratory tests involving 5 reference laboratories. Colonoscopy devices (n = 111) were sampled in 10 Italian hospitals. Culture-based microbiology and metagenomic tests were performed to verify PCR data.
Results
The sampling method was easily applied in all 10 endoscopy units and the optimized DNA extraction and amplification protocol was successfully performed by all of the involved laboratories. This PCR-based method allowed identification of both contaminated (n = 59) and fully reprocessed endoscopes (n = 52) with high sensibility (98%) and specificity (98%), within 3-4 hours, in contrast to the 24-72 hours needed for a classic microbiology test. Results were confirmed by next-generation sequencing and classic microbiology.
Conclusions
A novel approach for monitoring reprocessing of colonoscopy devices was developed and successfully applied in a multicenter survey. The general principle of tracing biological fluids through microflora DNA amplification was successfully applied and may represent a promising approach for hospital hygiene."

Surgical glove perforation may expose both patients and staff members to severe complications. This study aimed to determine surgical glove perforation rate and the factors associated with glove defect.
Material and methods
This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted between January and March 2017 at a Tunisian university hospital center in 3 different surgical departments: urology, maxillofacial, and general and digestive. The gloves were collected and tested to detect perforations using the water-leak test as described in European Norm NF EN 455-1. For percentage comparisons, the χ2 test was used with a significance threshold of 5%.
Results
A total of 284 gloves were collected. Of these, 47 were found to be perforated, a rate of 16.5%. All perforations were unnoticed by the surgical team members. The majority of perforated gloves (61.7%) were collected after urology procedures (P = .00005), 77% of perforated gloves were detected when the duration of the procedure exceeded 90 minutes (P = .001), and 96% were from brand A, which were the thicker gloves (P = .015).
Conclusions
This study highlighted an important problem neglected by surgical teams. The findings reaffirm the importance of double-gloving and changing gloves in surgeries of more than 90 minutes' duration."

Health care-associated opportunistic pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium persist on dry environments and can contribute to organism transmission through contact. These organisms can be monitored on surfaces by culture, molecular methods, or metabolic assays. This study was designed to determine the kinetics of bacterial persistence on acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, a plastic commonly used in the manufacture of bedrails.
Materials and methods
Polymerase chain reaction for genomic DNA was used to confirm the presence of bacteria cells on this plastic irrespective of viability. Bacterial viability was measured by culture, ATP quantification, and a metabolic assay at time points up to and longer than 1 year.
Results
Polymerase chain reaction confirmed the presence of bacteria on the plastic for the entire time period studied. However, S aureus culturability was reduced after 3 and 7 weeks; neither organism was culturable after 1 year. At 7 weeks, ATP levels were reduced for both organisms, paralleling S aureus culturability but indicating that ATP quantification did not predict E faecium culturability. S aureus-reducing potential was reduced after 7 weeks, whereas E faecium-reducing potential reached the level of fresh inoculum after 12 hours in broth culture. Low but significant levels of metabolic activity were detected for each organism after 1 year.
Conclusions
S aureus and E faecium cells may retain viability on plastic for longer than 1 year."

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a critical patient safety issue. Consistent and regular performance of appropriate practices is effective in preventing CDI. Variation in adherence to these practices can impede their effective implementation and weaken CDI prevention.
Methods
Using the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) framework we convened a focus group of 10 nurses to identify barriers and facilitators to compliance with a CDI prevention bundle that includes (1) prompt diagnostic testing, (2) empirical isolation for patients with suspected CDI, (3) consistent and appropriate contact isolation, (4) hand hygiene, and (5) disinfection of the patient room and objects in the room. On completion of transcript coding, analyses were performed based on bundle intervention and the work system element of the SEIPS model.
Results
A total of 58 excerpts were coded. Work system barriers or facilitators were associated with nearly every bundle intervention. The work system elements raised in over half of the excerpts were task (n = 31) (eg, amount of additional effort required to don and doff gloves and gowns) and organization (n = 30) (eg, recognition by all staff of the severity of CDI). Contact isolation was the most frequently discussed bundle intervention (n = 24).
Conclusions
The SEIPS systems engineering framework is useful to evaluate infection prevention practices for CDI and identify opportunities for improvement. Addressing the work system barriers and facilitators identified in this study is essential to effective implementation of infection prevention interventions, specifically for CDI."

Patient empowerment is recognized as an important component of a multimodal strategy to improve hand hygiene adherence. We examined the attitudes of adult patients and parents of pediatric patients toward a new patient empowerment tool (PET) at our hospital. We also surveyed physicians to determine their perceptions about the PET.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey was performed of hospitalized children's parents and adult patients in a 531-bed tertiary care teaching hospital in West Virginia. Surveys were anonymous and self-administered. A separate survey was administered via e-mail to resident and attending physicians from the departments of internal medicine, pediatrics, and family medicine.
Results
Most parents and adult patients felt it was their role to speak up if a provider did not perform hand hygiene, but a smaller number actually felt comfortable using the PET. Only 54.9% of physicians felt that patients should be involved in reminding providers to perform hand hygiene. Overall, physicians indicated that they would prefer a patient to use words rather than the PET to remind them to perform hand hygiene.
Conclusions
In our study, parents and adult patients supported use of the PET, but physicians were less supportive. As the patient empowerment movement grows, we should work to improve physician acceptance of patient involvement if it is to be successful."

Medical adhesives effectively hold closed approximated skin edges of wounds from surgical incisions, including punctures from minimally invasive surgery. In addition, they have been reported to be antibacterial against gram-positive bacteria.
Methods
Using membrane filtration to capture all organisms after contact with 2-octyl cyanoacrylate product for 3 minutes, we quantified the number of survivors. Controls were performed to rule out that the noted level of kill was caused by carryover product in the test system.
Results
We found that the product kills >7 logs of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The mechanism of action for the antibacterial effect is described as a function of very low water content.
Conclusions
As an antibacterial agent, the risk of nosocomial infection is greatly diminished, and an uneventful clinical result is facilitated. Bacterial growth cannot occur in the formulation and on contact death rapidly ensues as cellular water diffuses from the cell into the product."

Extensively resistant Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged and spread worldwide as a significant cause of health care-associated infections and outbreaks. It also causes life-threatening infections among neonates, including bacteremia. The aim of this study was to investigate an outbreak of A baumannii bacteremia (ABB) among neonates.
Materials and methods
A retrospective, case-control study was conducted from July 2014 to July 2015 in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Risk factors associated with ABB in univariate and multivariate analysis with logistic regression was performed. Molecular typing by pulsed field gel electrophoresis was used to confirm relatedness of bacteremic A baumannii strains.
Results
During the 5-year period (2011-2016), 68 patients in our NICU were diagnosed with BSI due to A baumannii. The case-control study included 41 case patients within the outbreak caused by a major epidemic clone and 108 control patients. Risk factors (by univariate analysis) associated with ABB were intubation, 14-day mortality, and use of peritoneal dialysis and an umbilical catheter. Multivariate analysis identified 14-day mortality (odds ratio, 5.75; 95% confidence interval, 2.58-12.79) and umbilical catheter use (odds ratio, 2.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-5.4) as independent risk factors for ABB.
Conclusions
This outbreak of bacteremia due to resistant A baumannii affected 41 infants and was associated with 58% mortality. Control of the outbreak was achieved by implementing long-term sustained infection control measures within the unit."

Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs) frequently wear gloves when they care for patients in standard precautions. If CNAs use gloves inappropriately, they may spread pathogens to patients and the environment, potentially leading to health care–associated infections (HAIs).
Methods
Using a descriptive structured observational design, we examined the degree of inappropriate health care personnel glove use in a random sample of 74 CNAs performing toileting and perineal care at 1 long-term care facility.
Results
During the 74 patient care events, CNAs wore gloves for 80.2% (1,774/2,213) of the touch points, failing to change gloves at 66.4% (225/339) of glove change points. CNAs changed gloves a median of 2.0 times per patient care event. A median of 1.0 change occurred at a change point. CNAs failed to change their gloves at a glove change point a median of 2.5 times per patient care event. Most (61/74; 82.4%) patient care events had >1 contaminated touch point. Over 44% (782/1,774) of the gloved touch points were defined as contaminated for a median of 8.0 contaminated glove touch points per patient care event. All contaminated touches were with gloved hands (P < .001).
Conclusions
Inappropriate glove use was frequently observed in this study. Contaminated gloves may be a significant cause of cross-contamination of pathogens in health care environments. Future research studies should evaluate strategies to improve glove use to reduce HAIs."

Environmental reservoir is an important source of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MRAB) outbreaks. The role of postoutbreak environmental surveillance for guiding sustained infection control effort has not been examined.
Methods
Enhanced environmental disinfection and regular environmental surveillance of ward communal areas after an outbreak were performed in a university-affiliated hospital. To assess the usefulness of environmental culture in predicting patients with MRAB, weekly surveillance of communal areas was continued for 3 months after the outbreak in intervention wards. The incidence of MRAB in intervention and nonintervention wards (control) was compared, whereas the other infection control measures remained identical.
Results
Postoutbreak weekly surveillance of communal areas showed that identification of newly diagnosed MRAB patients was significantly correlated with preceding environmental contamination with MRAB (P = .001). The incidence of nosocomial MRAB infection was significantly lower in the intervention compared with nonintervention wards (0.55 vs 2.28 per 1,000 patient days, respectively; P = .04). All MRAB isolated from the environmental and patients' samples belonged to multilocus sequence typing ST457 and were blaOXA23-like positive.
Conclusions
Environmental surveillance may serve as a surrogate marker for the presence of MRAB carriers. Implementation of timely infection control measures should be guided by environmental culture for MRAB to minimize the risk of MRAB outbreak."

Intraoperative sampling of airborne particulates is rarely performed in the OR because of technical difficulties associated with sampling methodologies and a common belief that airborne contamination is infrequently associated with surgical site infections (SSIs). Recent studies suggest that viable airborne particulates are readily disseminated throughout the OR, placing patients at risk for postoperative SSI. In 2017, virtually all surgical disciplines are engaged in the implantation of selective biomedical devices, and these implants have been documented to be at high risk for intraoperative contamination. Approximately 1.2 million arthroplasties are performed annually in the United States, and that number is expected to increase to 3.8 million by the year 2030. The incidence of periprosthetic joint infection is perceived to be low (<2.5%); however, the personal and fiscal morbidity is significant. Although the pharmaceutic and computer industries enforce stringent air quality standards on their manufacturing processes, there is currently no U.S. standard for acceptable air quality within the OR environment. This review documents the contribution of air contamination to the etiology of periprosthetic joint infection, and evidence for selective innovative strategies to reduce the risk of intraoperative microbial aerosols."

Several single-center studies have suggested that eliminating contact precautions (CPs) for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) control in nonoutbreak settings has no impact on infection rates. We performed a systematic literature review and meta-analysis on the impact of discontinuing contact precautions in the acute care setting.
Methods
We searched PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and Embase through December 2016 for studies evaluating discontinuation of contact precautions for multidrug-resistant organisms. We used random-effect models to obtain pooled risk ratio estimates. Heterogeneity was evaluated with I2 estimation and the Cochran Q statistic. Pooled risk ratios for MRSA and VRE were assessed separately.
Results
Fourteen studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the final review. Six studies discontinued CPs for both MRSA and VRE, 3 for MRSA only, 2 for VRE only, 2 for extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Escherichia coli, and 1 for Clostridium difficile infection. When study results were pooled, there was a trend toward reduction of MRSA infection after discontinuing CPs (pooled risk ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.70-1.02; P = .07) and a statistically significant reduction in VRE infection (pooled risk ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.72-0.94; P = .005).
Conclusions
Discontinuation of CPs for MRSA and VRE has not been associated with increased infection rates."

There are limited controlled data demonstrating contact precautions (CPs) prevent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) infections in endemic settings. We evaluated changes in hospital-acquired MRSA and VRE infections after discontinuing CPs for these organisms.
Methods
This is a retrospective study done at an 800-bed teaching hospital in urban Detroit. CPs for MRSA and VRE were discontinued hospital-wide in 2013. Data on MRSA and VRE catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), central line–associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), surgical site infections (SSIs), and hospital-acquired MRSA bacteremia (HA-MRSAB) rates were compared before and after CPs discontinuation.
Results
There were 36,907 and 40,439 patients hospitalized during the two 12-month periods: CPs and no CPs. Infection rates in the CPs and no-CPs periods were as follows: (1) MRSA infections: VAP, 0.13 versus 0.11 (P = .84); CLABSI, 0.11 versus 0.19 (P = .45); SSI, 0 versus 0.14 (P = .50); and CAUTI, 0.025 versus 0.033 (P = .84); (2) VRE infections: CAUTI, 0.27 versus 0.13 (P = .19) and CLABSI, 0.29 versus 0.3 (P = .94); and (3) HA-MRSAB rates: 0.14 versus 0.11 (P = .55), respectively.

We explored unit-based HAI leadership rounds led by 2 hospital leaders at a large academic hospital. Leadership rounds were observed on 19 units, recorded, and coded to identify themes. Themes were linked to the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and used to guide interviews with frontline staff members.
Results
Staff members disclosed unit-specific problems and readily engaged in problem-solving with top hospital leaders. These themes appeared over 350 times within 22 rounds. Findings revealed that leaders used words that demonstrated fallibility and modeled curiosity, 2 factors associated with learning climate and psychologic safety. These 2 themes appeared 115 and 142 times, respectively. The flexible nature of the rounds appeared to be conducive for reflection and evaluation, which was coded 161 times.

The objective of this study was to investigate risk factors for multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) infection within patients from a tertiary care hospital in Northern India. This case-control study examined MDRO infection risk factors, including diet, health history, and medical device use. We administered a diet questionnaire to collect data on usual diet and collected data on other risk factors from chart review. All participants were inpatients identified through hospital microbiology reports. A total of 39 MDRO patient cases and 91 controls were included.
Methods
Descriptive statistics, univariate analysis, and multivariate logistic regression were performed to evaluate the association between risk factors and MDRO infection.
Results
All cases had gram-negative MDRO infections. Univariate analyses found length of hospital stay, connective tissue disease, hospitalization in the last 12 months, hospitalization of a family member, in-hospital antibiotic use, antibiotic use in the last 12 months, and feeding tube, central venous line, and urinary catheter use to be significantly different between cases and controls. Logistic regression showed a >3-fold increase in the odds of infection with antibiotic use in the last 12 months (odds ratio [OR], 3.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-8.91) and urinary catheter use (OR, 3.63; 95% CI, 1.14-11.58). Differences in dietary preferences and fruit, vegetable, and fiber consumption were not significantly associated with infection.
Conclusions
Antibiotic use is a major driver of MDRO infections. Our findings suggest that interventions optimizing antibiotic stewardship and reducing device use should be a priority to prevent MDRO infections."

abstract = "Background
The use of intravascular catheters is often complicated by phlebitis, which is associated with increased morbidity and extended duration of hospitalization. We conducted a study to investigate the impact of needleless intravenous access devices on the rate of phlebitis in peripheral venous catheters (PVCs).
Methods
We prospectively recruited patients in 2 phases. The first group was treated with a regular cap, and the second group was treated with a needleless connector. The incidence of catheter-related phlebitis (CRP) was recorded as the primary end point.
Results
A total of 620 PVCs using regular caps were inserted into 340 patients and CRP rates were recorded. In the second phase of the study, 169 PVCs using needleless connectors were inserted into 135 patients. In the group treated with the regular cap, the CRP rate was 60% compared with 7% in the group treated with the needleless cap (P < .001). Consequently, the number of catheter replacements was decreased from 1.9 on average to 1.3 (P < .001). In both phases, patients who developed phlebitis had a statistically significant longer mean hospitalization period (P < .001), as were patients in the regular cap group (P < .01).
Conclusions
The use of needleless connectors was found to be associated with a significant reduction of CRP in peripheral veins in a surgery department setting. The decreased morbidity resulted in a lower number of catheter replacements and duration of hospitalization."

Electronic surveillance of infectious diseases involves rapidly collecting, collating, and analyzing vast amounts of data from interrelated multiple databases. Although many developed countries have invested in electronic surveillance for infectious diseases, the system still presents a challenge for resource-limited health care settings.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review by performing a comprehensive literature search on MEDLINE (January 2000-December 2015) to identify studies relevant to electronic surveillance of infectious diseases. Study characteristics and results were extracted and systematically reviewed by 3 infectious disease physicians.
Results
A total of 110 studies were included. Most surveillance systems were developed and implemented in high-income countries; less than one-quarter were conducted in low-or middle-income countries. Information technologies can be used to facilitate the process of obtaining laboratory, clinical, and pharmacologic data for the surveillance of infectious diseases, including antimicrobial resistance (AMR) infections. These novel systems require greater resources; however, we found that using electronic surveillance systems could result in shorter times to detect targeted infectious diseases and improvement of data collection.
Conclusions
This study highlights a lack of resources in areas where an effective, rapid surveillance system is most needed. The availability of information technology for the electronic surveillance of infectious diseases, including AMR infections, will facilitate the prevention and containment of such emerging infectious diseases."

Athletic centers have been locations for the transmission of community-acquired infections. This study assessed the capacity of copper alloys to reduce the bacterial burden associated with high-touch athletic center equipment. Copper alloy weights and grips were rotated with rubber coated and stainless steel controls in an undergraduate college athletic center over a 16-month period. The athletic center is used by college athletic teams, student body, and local community.
Methods
The primary outcome was to compare bacterial burdens on copper and control grips by swabbing surfaces. Significance was determined using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test with significance assessed at P < .05. Secondary outcomes included characterizing bacterial communities on surfaces and conducting antibiotic susceptibility testing using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method.
Results
Control athletic center components carried bacterial loads 94% larger than those found on copper alloy components. Bacterial community characterization revealed Staphylococcus to be the most common bacterial genus found on grip surfaces. Antibiotic resistance testing of the Staphylococcus isolates revealed that all isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and linezolid, whereas 35% of copper alloy isolates and 44% of control isolates were resistant to erythromycin.
Conclusions
Copper alloys can mitigate the bacterial burden on high-touch surfaces. Strategically placing copper alloys in areas of high human contact can augment infection control efforts and potentially decrease community-acquired infections in athletic centers."

Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter is a growing concern and has been identified as a serious threat by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, there is little information on MDR Acinetobacter in individuals with spinal cord injuries and disorders (SCI/Ds). Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify risk factors for, and assess outcomes of, MDR Acinetobacter in veterans with SCI/Ds.
Methods
This was a retrospective cohort study from January 1, 2012-December 31, 2013, using national Veterans Affairs medical encounter and microbiology data.
Results
A total of 773 Acinetobacter cultures were identified in 571 patients, of which 58.9% were MDR. Inpatient culture, sputum and other specimen type, receipt of antibiotics within 90 days before culture date, and pressure ulcers were identified as independent predictors of MDR Acinetobacter. Highest odds of MDR Acinetobacter were seen with previous antibiotic use (odds ratio, 7.27; 95% confidence interval, 2.59-20.54). Thirty-day mortality was 5.3% in this study. Multidrug resistance, previous mechanical ventilation 90 days before the culture, and cancer were all independent risk factors for 30-day mortality.
Conclusions
There should be increased efforts to highlight the importance of antimicrobial stewardship to improve infection control to help limit spread of Acinetobacter in health care settings."

Digital tools for hand hygiene do not share data, limiting their potential to support multimodal programs. The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, United Kingdom, worked with GOJO (in the United States), MEG (in Ireland), and SureWash (in Ireland) to integrate their systems and pilot their combined use in a clinical setting.
Methods
A 28-bed medical oncology unit piloted the system for 5 weeks. Live data from the tools were combined to create a novel combined risk status metric that was displayed publicly and via a management Web site.
Results
The combined risk status reduced over the pilot period. However, larger and longer duration studies are required to reach statistical significance. Staff and especially patient reaction was positive in that 70% of the hand hygiene training events were by patients. The digital tools did not negatively impact clinical workflow and received positive engagement from staff and patients. The combined risk status did not change significantly over the short pilot period because there was also no specific hand hygiene improvement campaign underway at the time of the pilot study.
Conclusions
The results indicate that integrated digital tools can provide both rich data and novel tools that both measure impact and provide feedback to support the implementation of multimodal hand hygiene campaigns, reducing the need for significant additional personnel resources."

From July 2010-April 2013, Leipzig University Hospital experienced the largest outbreak of a Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase 2 (KPC-2)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-2-Kp) strain observed in Germany to date. After termination of the outbreak, we aimed to reconstruct transmission pathways by phylogenetics based on whole-genome sequencing (WGS).
Methods
One hundred seventeen KPC-2-Kp isolates from 89 outbreak patients, 5 environmental KPC-2-Kp isolates, and 24 K pneumoniae strains not linked to the outbreak underwent WGS. Phylogenetic analysis was performed blinded to clinical data and based on the genomic reads.
Results
A patient from Greece was confirmed as the source of the outbreak. Transmission pathways for 11 out of 89 patients (12.4%) were plausibly explained by descriptive epidemiology, applying strict definitions. Five of these and an additional 15 (ie, 20 out of 89 patients [22.5%]) were confirmed by phylogenetics. The rate of phylogenetically confirmed transmissions increased significantly from 8 out of 66 (12.1% for the time period before) to 12 out of 23 patients (52.2% for the time period after; P < .001) after implementation of systematic screening for KPC-2-Kp (33,623 screening investigations within 11 months). Using descriptive epidemiology, systematic screening showed no significant effect (7 out of 66 [10.6%] vs 4 out of 23 [17.4%] patients; P = .465). The phylogenetic analysis supported the assumption that a contaminated positioning pillow served as a reservoir for the persistence of KPC-2-Kp.
Conclusions
Effective phylogenetic identification of transmissions requires systematic microbiologic screening. Extensive screening and phylogenetic analysis based on WGS should be started as soon as possible in a bacterial outbreak situation."

Study objectives were to track the transfer of microbes on soft surfaces in health care environments and determine the efficiency of an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)–registered soft surface sanitizer in the health care environment.
Methods
Soft surfaces at 3 health care facilities were sampled for heterotrophic plate count (HPC) bacteria, Staphylococcus spp, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Escherichia coli followed by a tracer study with a virus surrogate seeded onto volunteer hands and commonly touched surfaces. The occurrence of microbial contaminants was determined along with microbial reductions using the soft surface sanitizer. Soft surfaces were swabbed pre- and postintervention.
Results
Tracer viruses spread to 20%-64% and 13%-41% of surfaces in long-term health care facilities and physicians' offices, respectively. Only 1 pathogen, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, was recovered. The waiting room chairs had the highest concentration of HPC bacteria before disinfection (145.4 ± 443.3 colony forming units [cfu]/cm2), and the privacy curtains had the lowest (39.5 ± 84.2 cfu/cm2). Reductions of up to 98.5% were achieved with the sanitizer in health care settings and up to 99.99% under controlled laboratory conditions.
Conclusions
Soft surfaces are involved in the spread of microbes throughout health care facilities. Routine application of an EPA-registered sanitizer for soft surfaces can help to reduce the microbial load and minimize exposure risks."

Caesarean sections (CSs) are associated with a high infection risk. Surgical site infection (SSI) incidence is among the markers of effectiveness of infection prevention efforts. The aim of this study was to analyze risk factors for SSI, incidence, and microbiology in patients who underwent CS.
Methods
The study was conducted during 2013-2015 using active infection surveillance in 5 Polish hospitals according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control surveillance network known as HAI-Net. For each procedure, the following data were registered: age, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, procedure time, elective or emergency procedure, use of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis, microbiology, the treatment used, and other information.
Results
SSI incidence was 0.5% and significant differences were noted among hospitals (between 0.1% and 1.8%), for different American Society of Anesthesiologists scales (between 0.2% and 4.8%) and different values of standardized SSI risk index (between 0.0% and 0.8%). In 3.1% of procedures, with no antibiotic prophylaxis, SSI risk was significantly higher. Deep infections dominated: 61.5% with superficial infections in only approximately 30% of cases and 2.6% of infections were detected postdischarge without readmissions.
Conclusions
Results showed high incidence of SSI in Poland without perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis, and secondly, ineffective surveillance according to CS status, considering outpatient obstetric care. Without postdischarge surveillance, it is not possible to recognize the epidemiologic situation, and further, to set priorities and needs when it comes to infection prophylaxis, especially because such low incidence may indicate no need for improvement in infection control."

We report an outbreak of Burkholderia cenocepacia bacteremia and infection in 11 patients predominately in intensive care units caused by contaminated ultrasound gel used in central line insertion and sterile procedures within 4 hospitals across Australia.

Burkholderia cenocepacia was first identified in the blood culture of a patient from the intensive care unit at the Gold Coast University Hospital on March 26, 2017, with 3 subsequent cases identified by April 7, 2017. The outbreak response team commenced investigative measures.
Results
The outbreak investigation identified the point source as contaminated gel packaged in sachets for use within the sterile ultrasound probe cover. In total, 11 patient isolates of B cenocepacia with the same multilocus sequence type were identified within 4 hospitals across Australia. This typing was the same as identified in the contaminated gel isolate with single nucleotide polymorphism-based typing, demonstrating that all linked isolates clustered together.
Conclusion
Arresting the national point-source outbreak within multiple jurisdictions was critically reliant on a rapid, integrated, and coordinated response and the use of informal professional networks to first identify it. All institutions where the product is used should look back at Burkholderia sp blood culture isolates for speciation to ensure this outbreak is no larger than currently recognized given likely global distribution."

Although not all health care-associated infections (HAIs) are preventable, reducing HAIs through targeted intervention is key to a successful infection prevention program. To identify areas in need of targeted intervention, robust statistical methods must be used when analyzing surveillance data. The objective of this study was to compare and contrast statistical process control (SPC) charts with Twitter's anomaly and breakout detection algorithms.
Methods
SPC and anomaly/breakout detection (ABD) charts were created for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, Acinetobacter baumannii, catheter-associated urinary tract infection, and central line-associated bloodstream infection data.
Results
Both SPC and ABD charts detected similar data points as anomalous/out of control on most charts. The vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus ABD chart detected an extra anomalous point that appeared to be higher than the same time period in prior years. Using a small subset of the central line-associated bloodstream infection data, the ABD chart was able to detect anomalies where the SPC chart was not.
Discussion
SPC charts and ABD charts both performed well, although ABD charts appeared to work better in the context of seasonal variation and autocorrelation.
Conclusions
Because they account for common statistical issues in HAI data, ABD charts may be useful for practitioners for analysis of HAI surveillance data."

Setting
Two ACHs: a 30-bed facility and a 100-bed facility
Participants
Residents of the 2 ACHs diagnosed with UTI.
Methods
A retrospective review was conducted of UTIs clinically diagnosed at the 2 facilities over a 16-month period, utilizing surveillance and microbiologic data, resident progress notes, and medication charts. This data was reviewed to determine how many diagnosed UTIs met the revised McGeer definitions.
Results
Overall, 119 UTIs were diagnosed in 57 residents over 16 months. Only 7 of the diagnosed UTIs met the McGeer definitions. Forty-seven did not meet the clinical evidence, 17 did not meet the microbiologic evidence, and 48 did not meet either surveillance criteria.
Conclusions
This study demonstrated the disparity between the clinical diagnosis of UTI and the surveillance definitions for UTI, and highlights the limitations of the McGeer definitions in those with cognitive or communication deficits. There is an urgent need for antimicrobial stewardship programs and education in the ACH setting."

We studied the effectiveness of an ultraviolet C (UV-C) emitter in clinical settings and compared it with observed terminal disinfection.
Methods
We cultured 22 hospital discharge rooms at a tertiary care academic medical center. Phase 1 (unobserved terminal disinfection) included cultures of 11 high-touch environmental surfaces (HTSs) after terminal room disinfection (AD) and after the use of a UV-C–emitting device (AUV). Phase 2 (observed terminal disinfection) included cultures before terminal room disinfection (BD), AD, and AUV. Zero-inflated Poisson regression compared mean colony forming units (CFU) between the groups. Two-sample proportion tests identified significance of the observed differences in proportions of thoroughly cleaned HTSs (CFU < 5). Significant P value was determined using the Bonferroni corrected threshold of α = .05/12 = .004.
Results
We obtained 594 samples. Risk of overall contamination was 0.48 times lower in the AUV group than in the AD group (P < .001), with 1.04 log10 reduction. During phase 1, overall proportion of HTSs with <5 CFUs increased in AUV versus AD by 0.12 (P = .001). During phase 2, it increased in AD versus BD by 0.45 (P < .001), with no significant difference between AD and AUV (P = .02).
Conclusions
Use of UV-C with standard cleaning significantly reduced microbial burden and improved the thoroughness of terminal disinfection. We found no further benefit to UV-C use if standard terminal disinfection was observed."

Ward closure is a method of controlling hospital-acquired infectious diseases outbreaks and is often coupled with other practices. However, the value and efficacy of ward closures remains uncertain.
Purpose
To understand the current practices and perceptions with respect to ward closure for hospital-acquired infectious disease outbreaks in acute care hospital settings across Canada.
Methods
A Web-based environmental scan survey was developed by a team of infection prevention and control (IPC) experts and distributed to 235 IPC professionals at acute care sites across Canada. Data were analyzed using a mixed-methods approach of descriptive statistics and thematic analysis.
Results
A total of 110 completed responses showed that 70% of sites reported at least 1 outbreak during 2013, 44% of these sites reported the use of ward closure. Ward closure was considered an “appropriate,” “sometimes appropriate,” or “not appropriate” strategy to control outbreaks by 50%, 45%, and 5% of participants, respectively. System capacity issues and overall risk assessment were main factors influencing the decision to close hospital wards following an outbreak.
Discussion
Results suggest the use of ward closure for containment of hospital-acquired infectious disease outbreaks in Canadian acute care health settings is mixed, with outbreak control methods varying. The successful implementation of ward closure was dependent on overall support for the IPC team within hospital administration."

In total, 5,017 randomly selected rural residents participated in a seroepidemiologic and questionnaire survey. We found 326 hepatitis B surface antigen carriers or hepatitis C antibody carriers and 310 family members cohabiting with members of this group.
Results
Among the hepatitis B carriers and their family members, 48.1% were aware of their own status and 36.7% were aware of their cohabitant's hepatitis status, respectively. Only 28.1% of the hepatitis C carriers were aware of their own status, and only 23.3% of their cohabiting family members knew about their family member's hepatitis C status. A multivariate analysis including health-related factors, such as alcohol consumption, family history of liver disease, and recent acupuncture history, found that self-awareness was significantly lower in the older group and significantly higher in the more educated and higher-income groups. Family awareness was also increased in those working in salaried jobs.
Conclusions
Socioeconomic disparities in awareness of hepatitis status were found among hepatitis carriers and their families."

Some outbreaks associated with contaminated duodenoscopes have been attributed to biofilm formation. The objective of this study was to determine whether bacteria within an organic matrix could survive if the elevator lever was improperly positioned in the automated endoscope reprocessor (AER) after 1 round of reprocessing.
Methods
Duodenoscope lever cavities with an open or sealed elevator wire channel were inoculated with 6-7 Log10 of both Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis in ATS2015 (Healthmark Industries, Fraser, MI) and dried for 2 hours. The duodenoscopes with the lever in the horizontal position were processed through 2 makes of AERs. The cavity was sampled using a flush-brush-flush method to determine the quantity of surviving bacteria.
Results
E faecalis (range, 21-6 Log10 CFU) and E coli (range, 0-3 Log10 CFU) survived disinfection of sealed or unsealed elevator wire channel duodenoscopes in 2 different AERs with and without cleaning cycles.
Conclusion
If bacteria in organic residue are under the improperly positioned lever, then just 1 round of use is sufficient for bacteria to survive both liquid chemical sterilization and liquid chemical HLD regardless of whether or not the AER had a cleaning cycle."

The impact of an antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) on 30-day mortality rates was evaluated in patients prescribed vancomycin in a Veterans Affairs hospital.
Methods
A retrospective chart review of patients receiving a minimum of 48 hours of vancomycin during October 2006-July 2014. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine predictors of mortality. Interventions of the ASP consist of appropriate antibiotic selection, dosing, microbiology, and treatment duration.
Results
Death occurred in 12.4% of 453 patients. Of the 56 deaths, 64.3% occurred during prestewardship versus 35.7% during stewardship (P = .021). Increased mortality was associated with pre-ASP (odds ratio [OR], 2.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-4.27), age (unit OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.05-1.12), nephrotoxicity (OR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.27-8.01), and hypotension (OR, 3.28; 95% CI, 1.42-7.44). Patients treated in the intensive care unit were associated with increased mortality. Patients in the stewardship group experienced lower rates of mortality, which may be caused by interventions initiated by the stewardship team, including minimizing nephrotoxicity and individualized chart review.
Conclusions
Mortality in patients treated with vancomycin was decreased after antimicrobial stewardship was implemented. As anticipated, older age, hypotension, nephrotoxicity, and intensive care unit admission were associated with an increased incidence of mortality."

There has been a dramatic increase in the number of hospital-acquired infections, which is linked to the pandemic of multidrug resistance. Clinical environments provide an ideal reservoir for the growth, proliferation, and transmission of pathogenic organisms, including bacterial and yeast species. Consequently, the need for improved, effective disinfectants is of paramount importance.
Methods
Studies were conducted to assess the efficacy of chemical disinfectants—peracetic acid and triameen—on microbial strains. Testing included the assessment of antimicrobial and antisporicidal activity of disinfection solutions performed on a range of clinical isolates that pose a high risk for patient morbidity in clinical settings.
Results
Both chemical disinfectants successfully inactivated all test strains, with peracetic acid showing a greater level of antimicrobial activity. Escherichia coli proved most susceptible when assessed by the Kirby disk diffusion, suspension, and medical suspension assays with the greatest reduction in cell viability achieved. Antibiotic-resistant Enterococcus and Staphylococcus aureus strains showed greatest resistance to both disinfectants.
Discussion and conclusions
Test chemicals show potential to act as intermediate-level disinfectants inactivating vegetative microorganisms and bacterial spores on clinically relevant strains where they show potential as a preventative measure in relation to nosocomial infections."

Contaminated hospital surfaces contribute significantly to the transmission of health care-associated infections. Although disinfectants reduce bioburden by up to 99%, bacterial growth can rebound within hours to precleaning levels. We tested the effectiveness of an innovative, long-acting water-stable organosilane (WSO) to achieve sustained decreases in bioburden on hard surfaces.
Methods
A 5-month prospective, randomized, double-blind controlled study was performed. Eighteen intensive care unit rooms were randomly divided into placebo or treatment groups. Hard surfaces in all rooms were cleaned using the same protocol, except the placebo surfaces were cleaned with an inert saline solution and the treatment surfaces were treated with the WSO. Binomial regression with repeated measures were used to assess mean reductions in total bioburden as measured by colony forming units.
Results
The placebo resulted in average reductions in total colony forming units of 35% to 40% (relative risk reduction [RRR], 0.65; P < .01) and the WSO group averaged reductions of colony forming units by 66% to 99% (RRR, 0.55; P < .001). Total Staphylococcus aureus increased among the placebo rooms 30% (RRR, 0.69; P < .001), whereas in treatment rooms there was a reduction of 50%-60% (RRR, 0.57; P < .01). Although both sets of rooms saw reductions in bioburden or colony forming units, application of the WSO resulted in larger reductions. There was also greater variability in reductions in the placebo arm.
Conclusion
This is the first randomized, double-blind controlled study of an innovative WSO on high-touch hard surfaces at risk for high bioburdens. Sustained reductions of bioburden with the monthly application of this unique WSO may be associated with significant reductions in the risk of health care-associated infections."

Surveillance is an important tool for infection control; however, this task can often be time-consuming and take away from infection prevention activities. With the increasing availability of comprehensive electronic health records, there is an opportunity to automate these surveillance activities. The objective of this article is to describe the implementation of an electronic algorithm for ventilator-associated events (VAEs) at a large academic medical center
Methods
This article reports on a 6-month manual validation of a dashboard for VAEs. We developed a computerized algorithm for automatically detecting VAEs and compared the output of this algorithm to the traditional, manual method of VAE surveillance.
Results
Manual surveillance by the infection preventionists identified 13 possible and 11 probable ventilator-associated pneumonias (VAPs), and the VAE dashboard identified 16 possible and 13 probable VAPs. The dashboard had 100% sensitivity and 100% accuracy when compared with manual surveillance for possible and probable VAP. We report on the successfully implemented VAE dashboard. Workflow of the infection preventionists was simplified after implementation of the dashboard with subjective time-savings reported.
Conclusions
Implementing a computerized dashboard for VAE surveillance at a medical center with a comprehensive electronic health record is feasible; however, this required significant initial and ongoing work on the part of data analysts and infection preventionists."

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a multifaceted hand hygiene (HH) program on the infectious risk in nursing homes (NHs).
Methods
This was a 2-arm cluster randomized trial; French NHs were allocated randomly to the intervention (13 NHs) or control (13 NHs) groups. The intervention consisted of implementing a bundle of HH-related measures over 1 year, including increased availability of alcohol-based handrub, HH promotion, staff education, and local work groups. The primary end point was the incidence rate of acute respiratory infections and gastroenteritis reported in the context of clustered cases episodes. Secondary end points were mortality, hospitalization, and antibiotic prescription rates.
Results
Baseline characteristics did not differ between groups. The overall handrub consumption was higher in the intervention group over the 1-year intervention period. Because of underreporting, data on the primary end points were of insufficient quality for analysis. Hospitalizations did not differ between the 2 groups. However, the intervention group showed significantly lower mortality (2.10 vs 2.65 per 100 residents per month, respectively; P = .003) and antibiotic prescriptions (5.0 vs 5.8 defined daily doses per 100 resident days, respectively; P < .001). These results were confirmed by the longitudinal multivariate analysis adjusted for NH and resident characteristics and for seasonality (mortality rate ratio, 0.76).
Conclusions
A multifaceted HH intervention may have a short-term impact on mortality in NHs. Nevertheless, other strategies may remain necessary to reduce morbidity."

Decisions regarding the optimal provision of infection prevention and control resources depend on accurate estimates of the attributable costs of health care–associated infections. This is challenging given the skewed nature of health care cost data and the endogeneity of health care–associated infections. The objective of this study is to determine the hospital costs attributable to vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) while accounting for endogeneity.
Methods
This study builds on an attributable cost model conducted by a retrospective cohort study including 1,292 patients admitted to an urban hospital in Vancouver, Canada. Attributable hospital costs were estimated with multivariate generalized linear models (GLMs). To account for endogeneity, a control function approach was used.
Results
The analysis sample included 217 patients with health care–associated VRE. In the standard GLM, the costs attributable to VRE are $17,949 (SEM, $2,993). However, accounting for endogeneity, the attributable costs were estimated to range from $14,706 (SEM, $7,612) to $42,101 (SEM, $15,533). Across all model specifications, attributable costs are 76% higher on average when controlling for endogeneity.
Conclusions
VRE was independently associated with increased hospital costs, and controlling for endogeneity lead to higher attributable cost estimates."

Duration of indwelling urinary catheterization is an important risk factor for urinary tract infections. We devised a strategy to decrease the utilization of indwelling urinary catheters (IUCs). We also highlight the challenges of managing critically ill patients without IUCs and demonstrate some of the initiatives that we undertook to overcome these challenges.
Methods
A retrospective observational outcomes review was performed in an adult medical intensive care unit (ICU) between January 2012 and December 2016. This period included a baseline and series of intervals, whereby different aspects of the strategies were implemented. IUC utilization ratio and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) rates were calculated.
Results
Our IUC utilization ratio had a statistically significant decrease from 0.92 (baseline) to 0.28 (after 3 interventions) (P < .0001). Similarly, CAUTI rates had a statistically significant decrease from 5.47 (baseline) to 1.08 (after 3 intervention) (P = .0134). These rates sustained a statistically significant difference over the 2-year follow-up period from the last intervention. Incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) was identified as a potential complication of not using an IUC. There was no statistically significant change in the IAD rates during 2013-2016.
Conclusions
Our interventions demonstrated that aggressive and comprehensive IUC restriction protocol and provider training can lead to a successful decrease in IUC use, leading to a lower IUC utilization ratio and CAUTI rate in a large complex academic ICU setting."

Surveillance is an effective strategy for reducing surgical site infections (SSIs); however, current identification methods are resource-intensive. Therefore, we sought to validate an electronic SSI triaging tool for detection of probable infections and identify operational barriers and challenges.
Methods
A retrospective cohort study was conducted among all Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP)–reviewed surgeries at 2 Veterans Affairs medical centers from October 1, 2011-September 30, 2014. During the postoperative period, clinical and administrative variables associated with SSI (relevant microbiology order, antibiotic order, radiology order, and administrative codes) were extracted from the electronic medical record and used to score the probability (high, intermediate, and low) that an SSI occurred. VASQIP manual chart review was used as the gold standard of comparison.
Results
VASQIP manual review identified 118 SSIs out of 3,700 surgeries (3.2%). There were 2,041, 1,428, and 231 surgeries that met criteria for low, intermediate, and high probability for SSI. The tool's area under the curve was 0.86 (95% confidence interval, 0.82-0.89). The sensitivity among low-probability surgeries was 92.4%, and the specificity among high-probability surgeries was 95.1%.
Conclusions
The electronic SSI tool has the potential to be used for triaging VASQIP surveillance toward the high-probability surgeries and to avoid manual review of surgeries with low probability of SSI."

Implementation of isolation precautions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been justified through research and clinical evidence. However, nurses' understanding and compliance with these precautions is still unknown. The aim of this study was to assess nurses' knowledge and practices in relation to isolation precautions in Jordan.
Methods
A cross-sectional, descriptive design was used. The study took place in 8 hospitals in Jordan. A self-reported questionnaire and an observational checklist were developed based on the CDC (2007) isolation precautions guidelines.
Results
A total of 247 questionnaires were returned out of 400, for a response rate of 61.7%. The results show that most nurses (90%) have good knowledge of isolation precautions. However, only 65% of nurses reported good compliance with isolation precautions. The results of a t test revealed that nurses with Bachelor's degrees perform better in knowledge examinations than nurses with 2-year diplomas (P < .001). However, there was no significant difference in knowledge and self-report practices scores based on nurses' previous training and existence of isolation guidelines in their units or wards (P > .05). The results of the checklists confirm that there is a low compliance with standard isolation practice. In addition, the checklist shows that a high percentage of units and wards do not use isolation signs (46.4%) and posters (34.5%).
Conclusions
This study revealed that educating nurses about isolation is not enough strategy to improve their compliance. It is important to adapt other strategies, such as supporting nurses by giving them a manageable workload, and providing more supplies and reminders of isolation precautions in the hospitals."

Hand hygiene reduces health care–associated infections significantly. However, international evidence suggests that practices are suboptimal. The objective of this study was to compare and contrast hand hygiene attitudes and practices and alcohol-based handrub (ABHR) use among nurses between 2007 and 2015.
Methods
In 2007, a random sample of nurses in a large teaching hospital was invited to complete a postal survey using a validated questionnaire. In 2015, the study was replicated among all nurses employed in a university hospital group, including the setting of the original study. Data were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively using appropriate software.
Results
Attitudes to hand hygiene were positive and >90% of respondents' self-reported compliance before and after patient contact. However, 13% fewer in 2015 (42%) reported using ABHR >90% of the time compared with in 2007 (55%).

Use of positive role models, the adoption of a positive social and cultural norm within the organization, and the provision of continuing professional development opportunities may prove useful strategies in harnessing good practice among graduate nurses and in preventing negative socialization from occurring."

abstract = "Background
Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are one of the most common hospital-acquired conditions and no longer reimbursable from Medicare as of 2008. Nurse-driven protocols (NDPs), which provide a medically approved rubric for professional nurses to make autonomous care decisions, can facilitate appropriate catheter use and timely removal, as advised in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2009 CAUTI prevention guidelines. However, little attempt has been made to systematically evaluate their effect on clinical outcomes.
Methods
A systematic review of studies published in the United States since 2006 was performed, following guidelines from the Institute of Medicine. Sources included CINAHL, Medline, professional agencies, hand-searching, and expert consultation. Clinical predictors and prevalence of CAUTI were examined and synthesized qualitatively; heterogeneity of outcomes made a statistical meta-analysis inappropriate.
Results
Twenty-nine studies were found eligible for inclusion. All used a case-control (pre-post) approach, and all reported reductions in clinical predictors of CAUTI, particularly indwelling-urinary catheter utilization and CAUTI rates. However, the number of CAUTIs remained unchanged in 1 study. A formal quality assessment revealed a high risk of bias; included studies met an average of 4.9 out of 11 quality indicators. Specifically, many did not use standardized measures.
Conclusions
NDPs appear to have a positive impact on the clinical predictors and prevalence of CAUTI. However, this review identified need for improving the study design of quality improvement projects conducted within the patient care setting."

The impact of the site where an obstetrician dresses in their surgical scrubs, home versus hospital, on total bacterial burden remains unknown. Therefore, our objective was to quantify the effect of dressing in surgical scrubs at home versus at the hospital on the bacterial contamination at the beginning of a scheduled shift.
Methods
This was a single blind randomized controlled trial. Eligible participants were resident physicians assigned to labor and delivery at a single institution during the study period, and participants were randomized daily to 1 of 4 arms based on the site where their scrubs were laundered (A) and where the resident dressed (B) (A/B): home/home, home/hospital, hospital/home, and hospital/hospital. At the beginning of the assigned shift, microbiologic samples from the chest pocket and pants' tie were collected with a sterile culture swab. Samples were plated on trypticase soy agar with 5% sheep blood before being incubated at 35°C-37°C for 48 hours, with observation every 24 hours. The primary outcome was total bacterial burden, defined as the sum of the colony forming units (CFUs) from the 2 sampling sites.
Results
There were 21 residents randomized daily for 4 days to 1 of 4 study arms, resulting in 84 observations. There were no baseline differences between the home- and hospital-dressed cohorts. Overall, 68% of sampled scrubs demonstrated some bacterial growth. There was no difference between the home- and hospital-dressed cohorts in percentage of samples demonstrating any bacterial growth after 72 hours (60% vs 76%, P = .14), nor in median bacterial burden at the beginning of a shift (2 [interquartile range, 0-7] vs 1 [interquartile range, 1-5] CFUs, P = .62). Finally, there was no difference in total bacterial burden at the beginning of a shift between the home- and hospital-dressed cohorts when stratified by site where the scrubs were laundered.
Conclusions
There was no significant difference in total bacterial burden of surgical scrubs at the start of a shift between cohorts who dressed at home versus at the hospital."

Hospitals face growing pressure to meet the dual but often competing goals of providing a safe environment while controlling operating costs. Evidence-based data are needed to provide insight for facility management practices to support these goals.
Methods
The quality of the air in 3 operating rooms was measured at different ventilation rates. The energy cost to provide the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning to the rooms was estimated to provide a cost-benefit comparison of the effectiveness of different ventilation rates currently used in the health care industry.
Results
Simply increasing air change rates in the operating rooms tested did not necessarily provide an overall cleaner environment, but did substantially increase energy consumption and costs. Additionally, and unexpectedly, significant differences in microbial load and air velocity were detected between the sterile fields and back instrument tables.
Conclusions
Increasing the ventilation rates in operating rooms in an effort to improve clinical outcomes and potentially reduce surgical site infections does not necessarily provide cleaner air, but does typically increase operating costs. Efficient distribution or management of the air can improve quality indicators and potentially reduce the number of air changes required. Measurable environmental quality indicators could be used in lieu of or in addition to air change rate requirements to optimize cost and quality for an operating room and other critical environments."

The study reports a 2-year single-center experience of the practice of skin antisepsis using a 0.05% sodium hypochlorite solution before central venous catheter placement in neonates.
Methods
Eligible subjects included any hospitalized neonate who needed a central line for at least 48 hours. Infants were excluded if they had a generalized or localized skin disorder. An ad hoc Excel (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA) file was used to record the data from each patient. The catheter sites were monitored daily for the presence of contact dermatitis. Central line-associated bloodstream infection was diagnosed according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition.
Results
One hundred five infants underwent central venous catheter placement and were enrolled. A total of 198 central lines were inserted. The median gestational age was 31 weeks (range, 23-41 weeks) and median birth weight was 1,420 g (range, 500-5,170 g). There were no signs of 0.05% sodium hypochlorite-related skin toxicity in any infant. Of 198 catheters (1,652 catheter-days) prospectively studied, 9 were associated with bloodstream infections (5.4 per 1,000 catheter-days).
Conclusion
During the observation period, no local adverse effects were observed suggesting that 0.05% sodium hypochlorite may be a safe choice in this context."

Contextual factors associated with health care settings make reducing health care–associated infections (HAIs) a complex task. The aim of this article is to highlight how ethnography can assist in understanding contextual factors that support or hinder the implementation of evidence-based practices for reducing HAIs.
Methods
We conducted a review of ethnographic studies specifically related to HAI prevention and control in the last 5 years (2012-2017).
Results
Twelve studies specific to HAIs and ethnographic methods were found. Researchers used various methods with video-reflexive sessions used in 6 of the 12 studies. Ethnography was used to understand variation in data reporting, identify barriers to adherence, explore patient perceptions of isolation practices and highlight the influence of physical design on infection prevention practices. The term ethnography was used to describe varied research methods. Most studies were conducted outside the United States, and authors indicate insights gained using ethnographic methods (whether observations, interviews, or reflexive video recording) as beneficial to unraveling the complexities of HAI prevention.
Conclusions
Ethnography is well-suited for HAI prevention, especially video-reflexive ethnography, for activating patients and clinicians in infection control work. In this era of increasing pressure to reduce HAIs within complex work systems, ethnographic methods can promote understanding of contextual factors and may expedite translation evidence to practice."

abstract = "Background
Infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are associated with greater mortality and morbidity; however, risk factors for community-acquired infections caused by MRSA have not been established. Therefore, community patients who are admitted to hospitals without the necessary contact precautions and are infected with community-acquired lineages eventually cause these lineages to spread to these settings. The aim of this study was to detect community-acquired lineages of MRSA in patients on admission to a Brazilian teaching hospital.
Methods
The antimicrobial susceptibility of the MRSA isolates from nasal swabs was evaluated as was the molecular characteristics of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec). The clonality was determined using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence type analysis.
Results
A total of 702 patients were evaluated between March 2012 and March 2013; 180 (25%) of them were colonized by S aureus, and 21 (3%) were MRSA. The SCCmec IV/USA1100/sequence type (ST) 30 was the predominant MRSA lineage (42.8%), followed by SCCmec IV/USA800/ST5 (23.8%).
Conclusions
The occurrence of MRSA colonization was very low, and only 1 patient from cardiac surgery developed an infection, which was caused by an SCCmec II/USA100/ST5 isolate. Screening for MRSA colonization on admission does not seem to be productive; however, for populations submitted to specific surgeries, active surveillance should be implemented."

Mandatory notification of health care–associated (HA) infections, including influenza-like illness (ILI) outbreaks, has been implemented in France since 2001. In 2012, the system moved to online electronic notification of HA infections (e-SIN). The objectives of this study are to describe ILI outbreak notifications to Santé publique France (SPF), the French national public health agency, and to evaluate the impact of notification dematerialization.
Methods
All notifications of HA ILI outbreaks between July 2001 and June 2015 were included. Notifications before and after e-SIN implementation were compared regarding notification delay and information exhaustiveness.
Results
Overall, 506 HA ILI outbreaks were reported, accounting for 7,861 patients and health care professionals. Median delay between occurrence of the first case and notification was, respectively, 32 and 13 days before and after e-SIN utilization (P < .001). Information exhaustiveness was improved by electronic notification regarding HA status (8.5% of missing data before and 2.3% after e-SIN, P = .003), hypotheses of cause (25.4% of missing data before vs 8.0% after e-SIN, P < .001), and level of event control (23.7% of missing data before vs 7.5% after e-SIN, P < .001).
Conclusions
HA influenza notifications, including HA ILI or influenza, to health authorities are essential to guide decisional instances and health care practices. Electronic notifications have improved the timeliness and quality of information transmitted."

Health care personnel (HCP) working while experiencing influenza-like illness (ILI) contribute to influenza transmission in health care settings. Studies focused on certain HCP occupations or work settings have demonstrated that some HCP often continue to work while ill.
Methods
Using a national nonprobability Internet panel survey of 1,914 HCP during the 2014-2015 influenza season, we calculated the frequency of working with self-reported ILI (ie, fever and cough or sore throat) and examined reasons for working with ILI by occupation and work setting.
Results
Overall, 414 (21.6%) HCP reported ILI, and 183 (41.4%) reported working with ILI (median, 3 days; range, 0-30 days). Pharmacists (67.2%) and physicians (63.2%) had the highest frequency of working with ILI. By work setting, hospital-based HCP had the highest frequency of working with ILI (49.3%). The most common reasons for working while ill included still being able to perform job duties and not feeling bad enough to miss work. Among HCP at long-term care facilities, the most common reason was inability to afford lost pay.
Conclusions
More than 40% of HCP with ILI work while ill. To reduce HCP-associated influenza transmission, potential interventions could target HCP misconceptions about working while ill and paid sick leave policies."

Vaccination of health care personnel (HCP) can reduce influenza-related morbidity and mortality among HCP and their patients. This study investigated workplace policies associated with influenza vaccination among HCP who work in ambulatory care settings without influenza vaccination requirements.
Methods
Data were obtained from online surveys conducted during April 2014 and April 2015 among nonprobability samples of HCP recruited from 2 preexisting national opt-in Internet panels. Respondents were asked about their vaccination status and workplace policies and interventions related to vaccination. Logistic regression models were used to assess the independent associations between each workplace intervention and influenza vaccination while controlling for occupation, age, and race or ethnicity.
Results
Among HCP working in ambulatory care settings without a vaccination requirement (n = 866), 65.7% reported receiving influenza vaccination for the previous influenza season. Increased vaccination coverage was independently associated with free onsite vaccination for 1 day (prevalence ratio [PR], 1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.78 or >1 day PR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.29-1.94) and employers sending personal vaccination reminders (PR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.99-1.46).

Vaccination coverage increased with increasing numbers of workplace interventions.
Conclusions
Implementing workplace vaccination interventions in ambulatory care settings, including free onsite influenza vaccination that is actively promoted, could help increase influenza vaccination among HCP."

The 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea was a serious threat to public health, and was exacerbated by the inappropriate responses of major institutions and the public. This study examined the sources of confusion during the MERS outbreak and identified the factors that can affect people's behavior.
Methods
An online survey of the risk perception of university students in South Korea was performed after the epidemic had peaked. The questionnaire addressed the major social determinants in South Korea during the MERS epidemic. The analysis included data from 1,470 subjects who provided complete answers.
Results
The students had 53.5% of the essential knowledge about MERS. Women showed higher risk perception than men, and trust in the media was positively associated with risk perception (P < .001). Additionally, risk perception was positively associated with overreaction by the public (odds ratio, 2.80; 95% confidence interval, 2.17-3.60; P < .001). These findings suggest that media content affected the public's perception of MERS risk and that perception of a high level of risk led to overreaction.
Conclusions
Risk perception was associated with most of the social factors examined and overreaction by the public. Therefore, providing accurate information and data to the public, establishing trust, and facilitating the development of an attitude will all be important in future crises."

Our study describes the characteristics of current IPs and assesses for relationships between background, certification, experience, and type of work performed.
Methods
The data were drawn from an existing dataset collected in the conduct of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) MegaSurvey. Descriptive statistics were computed. Associations were calculated using χ2 or Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests. Characteristics of IPs were stratified by work-related activities to allow for comparisons between groups.
Results
Of the 13,050 active APIC members, 4,079 participated in the survey (31% response rate). The primary job activity for nurses (97.9%; n = 2,434) was preventing and controlling the transmission of infectious agents or health care–associated infections, for laboratory scientists (97.5%; n = 307) it was the interpretation of surveillance data, and for public health professionals (96.1%; n = 136) it was management and communication: feedback.

abstract = "Background
The prevalence and difference in likely indications of urinary catheterization (UC) in treated-and-released emergency department (ED) visits between men and women are currently unknown.
Methods
This was a cross-sectional analysis using the 2013 National Emergency Department Sample for all treated-and-released visits in persons aged ≥18 years. The prevalence of conditions associated with UC visits in men and women were identified. A hierarchical ranking was used to categorize diagnosis codes identified during ED visits into clinically meaningful categories to assess conditions for UC.
Results
In 2013, there were 87,797,062 treated-and-released ED visits in adults. The rate of UC in treated-and-released ED visits in adults was 4.3 per 1,000 visits, with 6.5 per 1,000 visits in men and 2.7 per 1,000 visits in women. Using the hierarchal ranking, a higher proportion of UC visits in men were coded for acute urinary retention, and a higher proportion of UC visits in women were coded for neurologic, cognitive, and psychiatric conditions.
Conclusions
The rate of UC in treated-and-released ED visits was higher in men than women, and UC rate increased with age. The heterogeneity of conditions coded in UC visits in women compared with men may suggest more potentially avoidable UC in women in the treated-and-released ED population. If confirmed, this would suggest opportunities for quality improvement in the ED to prevent overutilization of urinary catheters."

Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus have persisted as 2 major pathogens worldwide.
Aim
We designed a prevalence study to investigate the prevalence of nasal carriage of S aureus and A baumannii in long-term-care facilities (LCTFs) and their collaborative community hospitals. In addition, we aimed to clarify persistent or nonpersistent carriage of the 2 organisms among residents of LTCFs.
Methods
We performed a prevalence study concerning nasal carriers of A baumannii and S aureus in 3 LTCFs and 1 collaborative community hospital.
Results
Seventy subjects were enrolled and clustered into 3 groups: the elderly sick group (n = 24), the elderly healthy group (n = 33), and the healthy health care worker group (n = 13). Nasal samples were collected, and the nuc and mecA genes of S aureus and the blaOXA gene of A baumannii were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction. Among the 3 groups, the rate of nasal carriage of S aureus was approximately 0%-15%. However, the rate for A baumannii was approximately 54%-92%. Notably, the persistent carrier rate of A baumannii in the elderly sick group was 83.3% (20 out of 24) despite a 12.5% (3 out of 24) rate of carbapenem-resistant A baumannii.
Conclusions
We emphasized that the persistent nasal carriage of A baumannii in LTCFs could be another portal of exit to cause A baumannii infection in Taiwan."

Several Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) surveillance programs do not specify laboratory strategies to use. We investigated the evolution in testing strategies used across Quebec, Canada, and its association with incidence rates.
Methods
Cross-sectional study of 95 hospitals by surveys conducted in 2010 and in 2013-2014. The association between testing strategies and institutional CDI incidence rates was analyzed via multivariate Poisson regressions.
Results
The most common assays in 2014 were toxin A/B enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) (61 institutions, 64%), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) EIAs (51 institutions, 53.7%), and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) (34 institutions, 35.8%). The most frequent algorithm was a single-step NAAT (20 institutions, 21%). Between 2010 and 2014, 35 institutions (37%) modified their algorithm. Institutions detecting toxigenic C difficile instead of C difficile toxin increased from 14 to 37 (P < .001). Institutions detecting toxigenic C difficile had higher CDI rates (7.9 vs 6.6 per 10,000 patient days; P = .01). Institutions using single-step NAATs, GDH plus toxigenic cultures, and GDH plus cytotoxicity assays had higher CDI rates than those using an EIA-based algorithm (P < .05).
Conclusions
Laboratory detection of CDI has changed since 2010. There is an association between diagnostic algorithms and CDI incidence. Mitigation strategies are warranted."

During a large-scale airborne infectious disease outbreak, the number of patients needing hospital-based health care services may exceed available negative-pressure isolation room capacity.
Methods
To test one method of increasing hospital surge capacity, a temporary negative-pressure isolation ward was established at a fully functioning hospital. Negative pressure was achieved in a 30-bed hospital ward by adjusting the ventilation system. Differential pressure was continuously measured at 22 locations, and ventilation airflow was characterized throughout the ward.
Results
The pressure on the test ward relative to the main hospital hallway was −29 Pa on average, approximately 10 times higher than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance for airborne infection control. No occurrences of pressure reversal occurred at the entrances to the ward, even when staff entered the ward. Pressures within the ward changed, with some rooms becoming neutrally or slightly positively pressurized.
Conclusions
This study showed that establishing a temporary negative-pressure isolation ward is an effective method to increase surge capacity in a hospital."

Health care–associated infections (HAIs) have arisen as major sources of multidrug-resistant bacteria. Surgical site infections (SSIs) are the most frequent HAIs in many countries, with high antimicrobial-resistant prevalence.
Methods
A 7-year retrospective review (2008-2014) of microbiologic data within a prospective surveillance program on patients with SSI at a cancer hospital in Mexico.
Results
There were 23,421 surgeries performed during the study period. The SSI rate was 7.9%. Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) were found in 56.5% of samples. Escherichia coli was the most frequent microorganism (27.5%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (16.3%). SSI caused by S aureus showed a decreasing trend (P = .04). Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)–producing E coli increased from 39.5% in 2008 to 72.5% in 2014 (P < .001). Fluoroquinolone resistance also increased in all members of the Enterobacteriaceae. Methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) was isolated in 32% of cases with no significant increase (P value is not significant).
Conclusions
GNB caused most SSIs, with an increase of ESBL E coli strains. In breast and thoracic surgery, S aureus remained the most frequent isolate. MRSA remained stable throughout the study period. We observed a decreasing trend in S aureus. These findings show the differences in the microbiology of SSIs in a middle-income country and the increasing trend of ESBL enterobacteria and other multidrug-resistant organisms, such as Enterococcus faecium."

Basins used for patient bathing have been shown to be contaminated with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) and have prompted the evaluation of alternatives to soap and water bathing methods.
Methods
We conducted a prospective, randomized, open-label interventional crossover study to assess the impact of replacing traditional bath basins with prepackaged washcloths on the incidence of hospital-associated infections (HAIs), MDROs, and secondarily, rates of skin deterioration. Unit-wide use of disposable washcloths over an 8-month period was compared with an 8-month period of standard care using basins.
Results
A total of 2,637 patients were included from 2 medical-surgical units at a single tertiary medical center, contributing 16,034 patient days. During the study period, there were a total of 33 unit-acquired infections, the rates of which were not statistically different between study phases (incidence rate ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-2.23; P = .88). However, occurrence of skin integrity deterioration was significantly less in the intervention group (odds ratio, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.22-0.88; P = .02).
Conclusions
Although we were unable to demonstrate a significant reduction in HAI or MDRO acquisition, we found a decrease in skin deterioration with the use of disposable washcloths and confirmed earlier findings of MDRO contamination of wash basins."

Results
The mean age of participants was 48.35 years, and 16.8% were ≥65 years. Of the responders, 21.7% were vaccinated this year, whereas 57.8% did not desire to get it. Vaccination rates were significantly higher among responders ≥65 years of age (56.4%), those having at least 1 chronic illness (46.5%), and those who were vaccinated regularly every year (22.2%). Half of the responders did not know that the vaccine was reimbursed for people at risk. The most common reason for refusing the influenza vaccine was not getting the flu frequently (51.2%). Fear of side effects, concerns about vaccine's effectiveness, and belief that vaccine causes the flu were other common reasons for not being vaccinated. Of the responders, 77% believed that getting official information or a recommendation from a physician would influence their decision about seasonal influenza vaccination.
Conclusions
People who are at risk or vaccinated regularly display a higher vaccine uptake and better knowledge of influenza and vaccination. The opinions and attitudes of this study population may assist in developing strategies for changing attitudes of the public toward influenza vaccination."

We evaluated the practices used in Thai hospitals to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
Methods
From January 1, 2014-November 30, 2014, we surveyed all Thai hospitals with an intensive care unit and at least 250 beds. The use of prevention practices for CAUTI, CLABSI, and VAP was assessed. High compliance (≥75%) with all components of the CLABSI and VAP prevention bundles were determined. CAUTI, CLABSI, and VAP infection rates before and after implementing infection control practices are reported. Multivariable regression was used to examine associations between infection prevention bundle compliance and infection rate changes.
Results
Out of 245 eligible hospitals, 212 (86.5%) responded. A total of 120 (56.6%) and 115 hospitals (54.2%) reported ≥75% compliance for all components of the CLABSI and VAP prevention bundles, respectively, and 91 hospitals (42.9%) reported using ≥ 4 recommended CAUTI-prevention practices. High compliance with all of the CLABSI and VAP bundle components was associated with significant infection rate reductions (CLABSI, 38.3%; P < .001; VAP, 32.0%; P < .001). Hospitals regularly using ≥ 4 CAUTI-prevention practices did not have greater reductions in CAUTI (0.02%; P = .99).
Conclusions

Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) in intensive care units (ICUs) are associated with increased length of stay (LOS). The objective of this study was to graphically describe by heat mapping LOS of patients hospitalized in ICUs related to the occurrence of HAI and severity at admission measured by the Simplified Acute Physiological Score II (SAPSII).
Methods
Adult patients hospitalized in ICUs of Lyon University Hospitals (France) were included in an active standardized surveillance study of HAI from January 1, 1995-December 31, 2012. Surveillance included adult patients aged ≥18 years hospitalized ≥2 days. Patient follow-up ended at ICU discharge or death. LOS was calculated in days from differences between dates of entry and discharge from ICUs. HAIs recorded were pneumonia, bacteremia, and urinary tract infection. The heat map was designed with a spreadsheet software.
Results
A total of 34,694 patients were analyzed. Among infected patients, 72.3% had 1 infected site (IS), 23% had 2 ISs, and 4.7% had 3 ISs. Median LOS was 24 days in infected patients (20.4 days among patients with 1 IS, 34.2 days among patients with 2 ISs, and 45.3 days among patients with 3 ISs) and 5 days in noninfected patients (P < .001). Two groups of multi-infected patients with long LOSs were identified with the heat map.
Conclusions
The heat map facilitated easy-to-implement semi-quantitative visualization of increasing LOS through the SAPSIIs and number of ISs."

Identifying a central venous catheter (CVC) as the source of bacteremia requires drawing simultaneous blood cultures (BCs) from the CVC and peripheral site and correct labeling of the BC source. In our emergency center (EC), 52% of BCs collected from febrile cancer patients lacked source information, making the diagnosis and management of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) challenging.
Methods
Between January 2015 and June 2015, we conducted a quality improvement project in our EC aiming to increase the occurrence of simultaneous BC drawing with accurate source labeling by 10%.
Results
Staff education and monitoring increased average BC source labeling from a baseline of 48% to a much better rate of 70%. Label introduction led to increased source labeling to 94% by June 2015. This project had a significant influence in patients with a CVC and a positive BC because the physician is now able to determine whether the CVC is the source of the bacteremia in 88% of cases compared with 36% at baseline (P = .0003).
Conclusions
Education without an active intervention is usually not enough. Simple solutions such as label introduction can have significant influence on patient safety and care. Accurate diagnosis may guide clinicians at the bedside to appropriately manage CVCs in the setting of bacteremia, remove a CVC when indicated, and prevent unnecessary CVC removal with its potential safety and cost-effectiveness implications."

In recent years, there has been a significant shift of health care delivery to nonacute care settings. However, research on staffing and resources dedicated to infection prevention and control (IPC) in these settings is lacking.
Methods
The data for this analysis come from the 2015 APIC MegaSurvey. Descriptive statistics were computed to describe infection preventionists (IPs) employed in nonacute care settings. Bivariate analyses were conducted to examine differences in facility and demographic characteristics by type of nonacute care setting.
Results
In total, 861 IPs represented ambulatory surgical centers (33%), long-term care facilities (23%), long-term acute care facilities (20%), inpatient behavioral or mental health care (12%), clinic or outpatient services (10%), and home health care (3%). Few (15%) were Certified in Infection Control. Most (58%) reported that less than half of their job was officially dedicated to IPC. On average, respondents reported spending the largest proportion of their time on surveillance and epidemiologic investigation (19%). IPs lacked support for secretarial functions (23%), data management (14%), and electronic medical records (32%). IPC activities, staffing, and resources differed significantly by type of nonacute care facility.

Methods
Reprocessing practices at 2 institutions were assessed. Microbial cultures, biochemical tests, and visual inspections were conducted on sterilized ureteroscopes.
Results
Researchers examined 16 ureteroscopes after manual cleaning and sterilization using hydrogen peroxide gas. Every ureteroscope had visible irregularities, such as discoloration, residual fluid, foamy white residue, scratches, or debris in channels. Tests detected contamination on 100% of ureteroscopes (microbial growth 13%, adenosine triphosphate 44%, hemoglobin 63%, and protein 100%). Contamination levels exceeded benchmarks for clean gastrointestinal endoscopes for hemoglobin (6%), adenosine triphosphate (6%), and protein (100%). A new, unused ureteroscope had hemoglobin and high protein levels after initial reprocessing, although no contamination was found before reprocessing.
Conclusions
Flexible ureteroscope reprocessing methods were insufficient and may have introduced contamination. The clinical implications of residual contamination and viable microbes found on sterilized ureteroscopes are unknown. Additional research is needed to evaluate the prevalence of suboptimal ureteroscope reprocessing, identify sources of contamination, and determine clinical implications of urinary tract exposure to reprocessing chemicals, organic residue, and bioburden. These findings reinforce the need for frequent audits of reprocessing practices and the routine use of cleaning verification tests and visual inspection as recommended in reprocessing guidelines."

Antibiotic stewardship programs (ASPs) have not been fully developed for the emergency department (ED), in part the result of the barriers characteristic of this setting. Electronic health record–based clinical decision support (EHR CDS) represents a promising strategy to implement ASPs in the ED. We aimed to determine the cultural beliefs and structural barriers and facilitators to implementation of antimicrobial stewardship in the pediatric ED using EHR CDS.
Methods
Interviews and focus groups were conducted with hospital and ED leadership, attending ED physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and residents at a single health system in Colorado. We reviewed and coded the data using constant comparative analysis and framework analysis until a final set of themes emerged.
Results
Two dominant perceptions shaped providers' perspectives on ASPs in the ED and EHR CDS: (1) maintaining workflow efficiency and (2) constrained decision-making autonomy. Clinicians identified structural barriers to ASPs, such as pace of the ED, and various beliefs that shaped patterns of practice, including accommodating the prescribing decisions of other providers and managing parental expectations. Recommendations to enhance uptake focused on designing a simple yet flexible user interface, providing clinicians with performance data, and on-boarding clinicians to enhance buy-in.
Conclusions
Developing a successful ED-based ASP using EHR CDS should attend to technologic needs, the institutional context, and the cultural beliefs of practice associated with providers' antibiotic prescribing."

abstract = "Background
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission to health care personnel (HCP) after exposure to a HCV-positive source has been reported to occur at an average rate of 1.8% (range, 0%-10%). We aimed to determine the seroconversion rate after exposure to HCV-contaminated body fluid in a major U.S. academic medical center.
Methods
A longitudinal analysis of a prospectively maintained database of reported occupational injuries occurring between 2002 and 2015 at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center was performed. Data collected include type of injury and fluid, injured body part, contamination of sharps, resident physicians' involvement, and patients' hepatitis B virus (HBV), HCV, and HIV status.
Results
A total of 1,361 cases were included in the study. Most exposures were caused by percutaneous injuries (65.0%), followed by mucocutaneous injuries (33.7%). Most (63.3%) were injuries to the hand, followed by the face and neck (27.6%). Blood exposure accounted for 72.7%, and blood-containing saliva accounted for 3.4%. A total of 6.9% and 3.7% of source patients were coinfected with HIV and HBV, respectively. The HCV seroconversion rate was 0.1% (n = 2) because of blood exposure secondary to percutaneous injuries.
Conclusions
This study provides the largest and most recent cohort from a major U.S. academic medical center. The seroconversion rates among HCP exposed to HCV-contaminated body fluids was found to be lower than most of the data found in the literature."

abstract = "Health care–associated infection is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Hand hygiene is widely regarded as an effective prevention strategy. Often, hand hygiene research is designed and conducted by health care practitioners who may lack formal training in research methods, particularly in the area of social science. In a research context, a construct is a concept that can be measured or observed in some way. A construct can be directly or indirectly measured. For example, height can be directly measured by centimeters, whereas depression can be indirectly measured by a scale of 20 items. Every construct needs to be operationalized by measure(s) to make it a variable. Hence, construct validity refers to the degree of fit between the construct of interest and its operational measure. However, issues with construct validity often weaken the translation from construct to measure(s). This article will (1) describe the common threats to construct validity pertaining to hand hygiene research, (2) identify practical limitations in current research design, and (3) provide recommendations to improve construct validity in future hand hygiene research. By understanding how construct validity may affect hand hygiene research design, there is great potential to improve the validity of future hand hygiene research findings."

abstract = "Background
Infections in cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) constitute a serious complication. We sought to identify contamination of gloves before handling the device in primary and replacement CIED procedures.
Methods
Two groups of 30 patients underwent primary CIED implantation or replacement. Before the device entered the surgical field, surgeon and assistant imprinted their outer gloves on aerobe and anaerobe agar plates, and a wound swab was performed. Samples were cultured, and the presence of bacteria was identified, counted as the number of colony forming units, and characterized to the level of genus and species.
Results
Samples from 40 (67%) procedures revealed bacteria on surgeons' or assistants' gloves. Contamination occurred in 80% of replacements and 67% of primary implantations (risk difference, 13%; 95% confidence interval [CI], −8.8 to 35.5). Contamination of surgeons' and assistants' gloves occurred in 55% and 44% of procedures, respectively. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS) occurred in 52%, and Propionibacterium spp (PS) occurred in 84% of positive cases. For every 15 minutes of procedure time, colony levels increased by 7.4% (95% CI, 1.4%-13.4%).
Conclusions
Contamination of gloves is common during CIED procedures before handling the device. Therefore, devices are often handled with contaminated gloves. The most prevalent bacteria were PS and CNS, which are associated with clinical CIED infections. Changing outer gloves before handling the device might improve sterile state and lower infection risk."

The efficacy of the World Health Organization (WHO)–recommended handwashing technique against Clostridium difficile is uncertain, and whether it could be improved remains unknown. Also, the benefit of using a structured technique instead of an unstructured technique remains unclear.
Methods
This study was a prospective comparison of 3 techniques (unstructured, WHO, and a novel technique dubbed WHO shortened repeated [WHO-SR] technique) to remove C difficile. Ten participants were enrolled and performed each technique. Hands were contaminated with 3 × 106 colony forming units (CFU) of a nontoxigenic strain containing 90% spores. Efficacy was assessed using the whole-hand method. The relative efficacy of each technique and of a structured (either WHO or WHO-SR) vs an unstructured technique were assessed by Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
Results
The median effectiveness of the unstructured, WHO, and WHO-SR techniques in log10 CFU reduction was 1.30 (interquartile range [IQR], 1.27-1.43), 1.71 (IQR, 1.34-1.91), and 1.70 (IQR, 1.54-2.42), respectively. The WHO-SR technique was significantly more efficacious than the unstructured technique (P = .01). Washing hands with a structured technique was more effective than washing with an unstructured technique (median, 1.70 vs 1.30 log10 CFU reduction, respectively; P = .007).

Device-associated health care-acquired infections (DA-HAIs) in intensive care unit patients are a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and increased health care costs.
Methods
A prospective, structured clinicomicrobiological surveillance was carried out for 3 common DA-HAIs: ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) present in the patients of an intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in Nepal. DA-HAIs were identified using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definitions, and their rates were expressed as number of DA-HAIs per 1,000 device-days.
Results
Overall incidence rate of DA-HAIs was 27.3 per 1,000 patient-days occurring in 37.1% of patients. The device utilization ratio for mechanical ventilation, central line catheter, and urinary catheter was 0.83, 0.63, and 0.78, respectively. The rates of VAP, CLABSI, and CAUTI were 21.40, 8.64, and 5.11 per 1,000 device-days, respectively. Acinetobacter spp (32.7%), Klebsiella spp (23.6%), Burkholderia cepacia complex (12.7%), and Escherichia coli (10.9%) were the common bacterial pathogens. Most of the bacterial isolates associated with DA-HAIs were found to be multidrug-resistant.
Conclusions
Incidence of DA-HAIs in the study intensive care unit was high compared with that of developed countries. Formulation and implementation of standard infection control protocols, active surveillance of DA-HAIs, and antimicrobial stewardship are urgently needed in our country."

Influenza illnesses can result in missed days at work and societal costs, but influenza vaccination can reduce the risk of disease. Knowledge of vaccination coverage by industry and occupation can help guide prevention efforts and be useful during influenza pandemic planning.
Methods
Data from 21 states using the 2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System industry-occupation module were analyzed. Influenza vaccination coverage was reported by select industry and occupation groups, including health care personnel (HCP) and other occupational groups who may have first priority to receive influenza vaccination during a pandemic (tier 1). The t tests were used to make comparisons between groups.
Results
Influenza vaccination coverage varied by industry and occupation, with high coverage among persons in health care industries and occupations. Approximately half of persons classified as tier 1 received influenza vaccination, and vaccination coverage among tier 1 and HCP groups varied widely by state.
Conclusions
This report points to the particular industries and occupations where improvement in influenza vaccination coverage is needed. Prior to a pandemic event, more specificity on occupational codes to define exact industries and occupations in each tier group would be beneficial in implementing pandemic influenza vaccination programs and monitoring the success of these programs."

The adequate fit of an N95 respirator is important for health care workers to reduce the transmission of airborne infectious diseases in the clinical setting. This study aimed to evaluate whether adequately sealed N95 respirators may provide consistent protection for the wearer while performing nursing procedures.
Methods
Participants were a group of nursing students (N = 120). The best fitting respirator for these participants was identified from the 3 common models, 1860, 1860S, and 1870+ (3M), using the quantitative fit test (QNFT) method. Participants performed nursing procedures for 10-minute periods while wearing a backpack containing the portable aerosol spectrometers throughout the assessment to detect air particles inside the respirator.
Results
The average fit factor of the best fitting respirator worn by the participants dropped significantly after nursing procedures (184.85 vs 134.71) as detected by the QNFT. In addition, significant differences in particle concentration of different sizes (>0.3, >0.4, >1.0, and >4.0 µm) inside the respirator were detected by the portable aerosol spectrometers before, during, and after nursing procedures.
Conclusions
Body movements during nursing procedures may increase the risk of face seal leakage. Further research, including the development of prototype devices for better respirator fit, is necessary to improve respiratory protection of users."

The prevalence of infection with multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB) after solid-organ transplantation is increasing. Surveillance culture (SC) seems to be an important tool for MDR-GNB control. The goal of this study was to analyze the performance of SC for MDR-GNB among liver transplant (LT) recipients.
Methods
This was a prospective cohort study involving patients who underwent LT between November 2009 and November 2011. We screened patients for extended spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, extended spectrum β-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA), and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB). We collected SC samples immediately before LT and weekly thereafter, until hospital discharge. Samples were collected from the inguinal-rectal area, axilla, and throat. The performance of SC was evaluated through analysis of its sensitivity, negative predictive value, and accuracy.
Results
During the study period, 181 patients were evaluated and 4,110 SC samples were collected. The GNB most often identified was CRAB, in 45.9% of patients, followed by CRKP in 40.3%. For all microorganisms, the positivity rate was highest among the inguinal-rectal samples. If only samples collected from this area were considered, the SC would fail to identify 34.9% of the cases of CRAB colonization. The sensitivity of SC for CRKP was 92.5%. The performance of SC was poorest for CRAB (sensitivity, 80.6%).
Conclusions
Our data indicate that SC is a sensitive tool to identify LT recipients colonized by MDR-GNB."

Animal-assisted intervention (AAI) programs are increasing in popularity, but it is unknown to what extent therapy animal organizations that provide AAI and the hospitals and eldercare facilities they work with implement effective animal health and safety policies to ensure safety of both animals and humans. Our study objective was to survey hospitals, eldercare facilities, and therapy animal organizations on their AAI policies and procedures.
Methods
A survey of United States hospitals, eldercare facilities, and therapy animal organizations was administered to assess existing health and safety policies related to AAI programs.
Results
Forty-five eldercare facilities, 45 hospitals, and 27 therapy animal organizations were surveyed. Health and safety policies varied widely and potentially compromised human and animal safety. For example, 70% of therapy animal organizations potentially put patients at risk by allowing therapy animals eating raw meat diets to visit facilities. In general, hospitals had stricter requirements than eldercare facilities.
Discussion
This information suggests that there are gaps between the policies of facilities and therapy animal organizations compared with recent guidelines for animal visitation in hospitals.
Conclusions
Facilities with AAI programs need to review their policies to address recent AAI guidelines to ensure the safety of animals and humans involved."

Methods
Clinical data obtained from the patients with IRAB during an outbreak from May 2014-October 2014 were reviewed. Microbiologic sampling from the environment and the hands of health care workers (HCWs) was performed. Clinical isolates from case patients were genotyped using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).
Results
During the outbreak period, 12 patients were colonized or infected with IRAB. The hospital room environments of the case patients were contaminated with IRAB. Hands of nurses and physicians were not colonized with IRAB, but the hands of 2 bedside caregivers of case patients were colonized with IRAB. The PFGE analysis revealed that at least 2 major genetically distinct strains disseminated between 2 different wards. After implementation of infection control measures with a cohort of nursing patients, hand hygiene education for caregivers who had not received instructions before the outbreak, and a critical value alert system to notify case patients, the outbreak was controlled successfully.
Conclusions
This outbreak study highlights the importance of adherence to hand hygiene by all HCWs to prevent the dissemination of multidrug-resistant organisms."

A variety of hand hygiene monitoring programs (HHMPs) have come into use in hospitals throughout the world. In the present study, we compare continuous closed circle television (CCTV) with overt observation for monitoring the hand hygiene compliance of health care workers (HCWs) in a general intensive care unit (GICU).
Methods
This is a cross-sectional and comparative study. In this study, we use a novel hand hygiene CCTV monitoring system for hand hygiene performance monitoring. The study population incorporated all the GICU HCWs, including registered nurses, staff physicians, and auxiliary workers.
Results
All HCWs of our GICU were observed, including ICU registered nurses, ICU staff physicians, and auxiliary workers participated in the present study. Overall, each observer team did 50 sessions in each arm of the study. Total number of hand hygiene opportunities was approaching 500 opportunities. The compliance rates when only overt observations were performed was higher than when only covert observations were performed with a delta of approximately 10% (209 out of 590 [35.43%] vs 130 out of 533 [24.39%]; P < .001). Both methods of observations (overt and covert [CCTV]) demonstrated excellent reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC], 0.96 [0.93-0.98] of overt and ICC, 0.81 [0.69-0.89] for covert, respectively). However, the correlation between both methods was found weak in simultaneous sessions (ICC, 0.40 [0.62-0.107]).
Conclusion
We demonstrated that CCTV is an appropriate, reliable, and neutral method for observation of hand hygiene. However, there is no clear basis for incorporating a CCTV observation modality into a health care system that already operates an overt observation program. We have shown that CCTV methodology records a different distribution of opportunities for performing hand hygiene and of actual performances of hand hygiene compared with overt observation."

Our aim is to assess the functionality of this new room, and in so doing, to evaluate the methods used.
Methods
We employed a mixed-methods approach involving video recording, interviews, and objective temperature and humidity measurements within a crossover interventional study. Participants completed a range of clinical activities in the RediRoom and a control. The setting for the study was a clinical ward environment at an Australian higher education institution.
Results
There were similarities between the RediRoom and the control using a range of measures. The time taken to complete a range of clinical activities in both rooms was broadly consistent. Network analysis also suggested broad similarities in the movement of nurses undertaking activities in both rooms.
Conclusion
Our study attempted to simulate a clinical environment and clinical activities and provide the best possible comparison by completing activities sequentially, with immediate feedback to researchers. Video recording added significant value to the process because it provided some objectivity. A form of reflexive ethnography with participants could be of value in similar studies in the future."

Measuring and providing feedback about hand hygiene (HH) compliance is a complicated process. Electronic HH monitoring systems have been proposed as a possible solution; however, there is little information available about how to successfully implement and maintain these systems for maximum benefit in community hospitals.
Methods
An electronic HH monitoring system was implemented in 3 community hospitals by teams at each facility with support from the system vendor. Compliance rates were measured by the electronic monitoring system. The implementation challenges, solutions, and drivers of success were monitored within each facility.
Results
The electronic HH monitoring systems tracked on average more than 220,000 compliant HH events per facility per month, with an average monthly compliance rate >85%. The sharing of best practices between facilities was valuable in addressing challenges encountered during implementation and maintaining a high rate of use.
Discussion
Drivers of success included a collaborative environment, leadership commitment, using data to drive improvement, consistent and constant messaging, staff empowerment, and patient involvement.

Methods
Review of the health care–associated infection data regarding B cepacia via the surveillance system, hospital information system, electronic medical records, and laboratory information system together with the outbreak investigation was managed by the health care–associated infection control team.
Results
During June 1-14, 2015, 4 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) were identified; B cepacia was isolated from endotracheal aspirate samples. On June 16, 120 environmental samples were collected and analyzed for microbiologic differentiation. Thirteen strains of B cepacia were prominently found in the expiratory blocks of ventilators, revealing the biocontamination source. After chemical disinfection without damaging ventilator components, repeat microbiologic testing of random ventilator samples yielded negative results until July 30, 2015. Retrospective data showed that isolation rates of B cepacia strains had increased since 2014. Although the resistance phenotype of these strains varied slightly, they exhibited similar patterns of antibiotic susceptibility.
Conclusions
Routine cleaning and disinfection of ventilators, in addition to an intervention bundle, should form part of an integrated VAP prevention and management approach."

abstract = "Background
The risk of infection, including surgical site infection (SSI), after spine surgery has increased due to aging and more immunocompromised hosts. An infection control team (ICT) is responsible for management of health care-associated infections at our institution.
Methods
The study subjects were 40 patients (18 men and 22 women with an average age of 54 years) referred to the ICT after spine surgery since 2010. Pathogenic bacteria and treatment in these cases were reviewed.
Results
Collaboration with the ICT involved guidance on use of antibiotics for infection in 30 patients (16 SSI and 14 non-SSI) and a search for the infection focus for fever of unknown origin in 10 patients (7 patients were found to have urinary tract infections and 2 patients were found to have pneumonia). The detection rate of causative bacteria in ICT consultation was 88% (35 out of 40 patients). SSI patients with instrumentation involved had a significantly higher rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection compared with those without instrumentation (42% vs 13%; P < .05).
Discussion
All cases of SSI with instrumentation involved were cured by ICT support without removal of instrumentation. Early assistance from the ICT was important for prevention of worsening of methicillin-resistant S aureus infection.
Conclusions
Collaboration with the ICT was helpful for detection of pathogenic bacteria and allowed appropriate use of antibiotics at an early stage."

The recent Ebola virus disease outbreak emphasized the potential misuse of personal protective equipment (PPE) by health care workers (HCWs) during such an event. We aimed to compare self-perceived proficiency of PPE use and objective performance, and identify predictors of low compliance and PPE misuse.
Methods
An observational study combined with subjective questionnaires were carried out during a bioterror simulation drill. Forty-two observers evaluated performance under PPE. Mistakes were recorded and graded using a structured observational format and were correlated with the subjective questionnaires and with demographic parameters.
Results
One hundred seventy-eight HCWs from community clinics and hospitals were included. The mean self-perceived proficiency was high (6.1 out of 7), mean level of comfort was moderate (4.0 out of 7), and mean objective performance was intermediate (9.5 out of 13). There was no correlation between comfort and objective performance scores. Self-perceived proficiency was in correlation with donning and continuous performance with PPE but not with doffing. Clinic personnel performed better than personnel in hospitals (40.3% vs 67.8% with 3 or more mistakes, respectively; P = .001). Demographic characteristics had no correlation with objective or self-perceived performance.
Conclusions
Self-perceived proficiency is a poor predictor of appropriate PPE use. The results suggest poor awareness of the possibility of PPE misuse."

Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) play an important role in the mortality of immunocompromised patients. The pediatric hematology department (PHD) at Besançon University Hospital has relocated 3 times: (1) from a building without an air filtration system (B1), (2) to a renovated building with low air pressure (B2), and (3) to a new building with high air pressure and high-efficiency particulate air filters (B3). This study aimed to investigate how these relocations influenced the fungal exposure risk for the PHD's patients.
Methods
Air samples were taken monthly in patient rooms and weekly in corridors. The detection of opportunistic fungi species was used to assess IFI risk. Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate random-effects negative binomial regression.
Results
A total of 1,074 samples from 29 rooms over a 10-year period showed that renovation of an old building with a basic ventilation system did not lead to a significant improvement of air quality (P = .004, multivariate analysis). Among factors linked to higher risk of patient rooms mold contamination was fungal contamination of the corridors (P < .001).
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that corridors can be used as reliable sentinel to prevent fungal contamination in patient rooms. Only relocation in building B3, equipped with laminar air flow, achieved adequate air quality."

Quaternary ammonium–based (Quat) disinfectants are widely used, but they have disadvantages.
Methods
This was a 12-month prospective cluster controlled crossover trial. On 4 wards, housekeepers performed daily cleaning using a disinfectant containing either 0.5% improved hydrogen peroxide (IHP) or Quat. Each month, 5-8 high-touch surfaces in several patient rooms on each ward were tagged with a fluorescent marker and cultured before and after cleaning. Hand hygiene compliance rates and antimicrobial usage on study wards were obtained from hospital records. Outcomes included aerobic colony counts (ACCs), percent of wiped surfaces yielding no growth after cleaning, and a composite outcome of incidence densities of nosocomial acquisition and infection caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium difficile infection. Statistical analysis was performed using χ2 test, Fisher exact test, Welch test, and logistic regression methods.
Results
Mean ACCs per surface after cleaning were significantly lower with IHP (14.0) than with Quat (22.2) (P = .003). The proportion of surfaces yielding no growth after cleaning was significantly greater with IHP (240/500; 48%) than with Quat (182/517; 35.2%) (P < .0001). Composite incidence density of nosocomial colonization or infection with IHP (8.0) was lower than with Quat (10.3) (incidence rate ratio, 0.77; P = .068; 95% confidence interval, 0.579-1.029).
Conclusions
Compared with a Quat disinfectant, the IHP disinfectant significantly reduced surface contamination and reduced a composite colonization or infection outcome."

abstract = "Background
Although additional contact precautions (ACPs) are routinely used to reduce cross-transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), the relevance of isolation precautions remains debated. We hypothesized that the collection of recognized risk factors for MDRO carriage on intensive care unit (ICU) admission might be helpful to target ACPs without increasing MDRO acquisition during ICU stays, compared with universal ACPs.
Materials and Methods
This is a sequential single-center observational study performed in consecutive patients admitted to a French medical and surgical ICU. During the first 6-month period, screening for MDRO carriage and ACPs were performed in all patients. During the second 6-month period, screening was maintained, but ACP use was guided by the presence of at least 1 defined risk factor for MDRO.
Results
During both periods, 33 (10%) and 30 (10%) among 327 and 297 admissions were, respectively, associated with a positive admission MDRO carriage. During both periods, a second screening was performed in 147 (45%) and 127 (43%) patients. Altogether, the rate of acquired MDRO (positive screening or clinical specimen) was similar during both periods (10% [n = 15] and 11.8% [n = 15], respectively; P = .66).
Conclusions
The results of our study contribute to support the safety of an isolation-targeted screening policy on ICU admission compared with universal screening and isolation regarding the rate of ICU-acquired MDRO colonization or infection."

Health care–associated infections (HCAIs) are preventable with adoption of recognized preventive measures. The first step is to identify patients at higher risk of HCAI. This study aimed to identify patient risk factors (RFs) present on admission and acquired during inpatient stay which could be associated with higher risk of acquiring HCAI.
Methods
A case-control study was conducted in adult patients admitted during 2011 who were hospitalized for >48 hours. Cases were patients with HCAIs. Controls were selected in a ratio of 3:1, case matched by the admission date. The likelihood of increased HCAI was determined through binary logistic regression.
Results
RFs identified as being the more relevant for HCAI were being a man (odds ratio [OR], 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-4.7), being aged >50 years (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.3-6.9), and having an insertion of a central venous line during hospital stay (OR, 12.4; 95% CI, 5.0-30.5).
Conclusions
RFs that showed statistical significance on admission were the patient's intrinsic factors, and RFs acquired during hospitalization were extrinsic RFs. When a set of RFs were present, the presence of a central venous line proved to be the more relevant one."

abstract = "Background
This was an observational study designed to estimate the frequency of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) transmission to gowns and gloves worn by health care workers (HCWs) interacting with Veterans Affairs Community Living Center (VA nursing home) residents to inform MRSA prevention policies.
Methods
Participants included residents and HCWs from 7 VA nursing homes in 4 states and Washington, DC. Residents were cultured for MRSA at the anterior nares, perianal skin, and wound (if present). HCWs wore gowns and gloves during usual care activities. After each activity, a research coordinator swabbed the HCW's gown and gloves. Swabs were cultured for MRSA.
Results
There were 200 residents enrolled; 94 (46%) were MRSA colonized. Glove contamination was higher than gown contamination (20% vs 11%, respectively; P < .01). Transmission varied greatly by type of care from 0%-19% for gowns and 7%-37% for gloves. High-risk care activities (odds ratio [OR] > 1.0, P < .05) for gown contamination included changing dressings (eg, wound), dressing, providing hygiene (eg, brushing teeth), and bathing. Low-risk care activities (OR < 1.0, P < .05 or no transmission) for gown contamination included glucose monitoring, giving medications, and feeding.
Conclusions
MRSA transmission from colonized residents to gloves was higher than transmission to gowns. Transmission to gloves varies by type of care, but all care had a risk of contamination, demonstrating the importance of hand hygiene after all care. Transmission to gowns was significantly higher with certain types of care. Optimizing gown and glove use by targeting high-risk care activities could improve resident-centered care for MRSA-colonized residents by promoting a home-like environment."

Alcohol is frequently inappropriately used on surgical instruments to reduce bacterial contamination, but fixes protein to stainless steel. Here we compare the effect of air drying, prolonged soaking in water, and alcohol treatment on cleaning difficulty of contaminated forceps.
Methods
Haltsted-mosquito forceps were contaminated with only Staphylococcus aureus. Instruments were air-dried for 10 (control), 75, or 240 minutes, soaked in water, or air dried then treated with ethanol or isopropanol for 10 seconds. All instruments were prewashed for 15 minutes. Forceps contaminated with blood and S aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa were dried and then sprayed or wiped with ethanol, and prewashed. Bacterial viability and soiling were determined by standard plate culture and crystal violet staining, respectively.
Results
Soaking or spraying instruments with alcohol significantly reduced viable bacterial numbers, but significantly increased soil attached to forceps, as did air drying. Wiping instruments with alcohol had little effect on bacterial viability, but increased cleaning difficulty. Soaking in water for 75 or 240 minutes increased cleaning difficulty perhaps due to bacterial attachment to forceps.
Conclusions
Treating contaminated instruments with alcohol, allowing them to dry, or allowing them to soak in water for prolonged periods increases cleaning difficulty and should be discouraged."

A human factors engineering-based intervention aimed at the modification of task behavior to increase adherence to best practices and the reduction of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI). The hypothesis was tested that a central line maintenance kit would improve adherence and reduce CLABSI compared with a standard, nonkit-based method of performing central line maintenance.
Design
The study design was a 29-month prospective, interventional, nonrandomized, observational, and clinical research study using a pre–post implementation assessment.
Setting
The study was conducted at a tertiary hospital in the southwestern United States, with participants recruited from a total of 6 patient units (including intensive care units and general wards).
Participants
A total of 95 nurses and 151 patients volunteered to participate in the study.
Intervention
A central line maintenance kit was developed that incorporated human factors engineering design principles. This kit was implemented hospitalwide during the clinical study to assess the intervention's influence on protocol adherence and clinical outcomes compared with a preimplementation control condition (no kit use).
Results
The results of this clinical observations study suggest that a human factors engineering-based kit improved adherence to best practices during central line maintenance. In addition, the number of CLABSIs was significantly reduced during the postimplementation period.
Conclusions
The application of human factors engineering design principles in the development of medical kits can improve protocol adherence and clinical outcomes."

Disadvantages include the resources required for observational surveys, insufficient sample sizes, and nonstandardized methods of conducting observations. Electronic and camera-based systems can monitor hand hygiene performance on all work shifts without a Hawthorne effect and provide significantly more data regarding hand hygiene performance. Disadvantages include the cost of installation, variable accuracy in estimating compliance rates, issues related to acceptance by HCP, insufficient data regarding their cost-effectiveness and influence on health care-related infection rates, and the ability of most systems to monitor only surrogates for Moments 1, 4, and 5. Increasing evidence suggests that monitoring only Moments 1, 4, and 5 provides reasonable estimates of compliance with all 5 Moments.

Multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB) are associated with an increasing proportion of infections among nursing home (NH) residents. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to critically review evidence of the prevalence of MDR-GNB among NH residents.
Methods
Following Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines, a systematic review of literature for the years 2005-2016 using multiple databases was conducted. Study quality, appraised by 2 reviewers, used Downs and Black risk of bias criteria. Studies reporting prevalence of MDR-GNB colonization were pooled using a random effects meta-analysis model. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran Q and I2 statistics.
Results
Of 327 articles, 12 met the criteria for review; of these, 8 met the criteria for meta-analysis. Escherichia coli accounted for the largest proportion of isolates. Reported MDR-GNB colonization prevalence ranged from 11.2%-59.1%. Pooled prevalence for MDR-GNB colonization, representing data from 2,720 NH residents, was 27% (95% confidence interval, 15.2%-44.1%) with heterogeneity (Q = 405.6; P = .01; I2 = 98.3). Two studies reported MDR-GNB infection rates of 10.9% and 62.7%.

Antimicrobial stewardship programs, particularly pharmacist-driven programs, help reduce the unnecessary use of antimicrobial agents. The objective of this study was to assess the influence of pharmacist-driven antimicrobial stewardship on antimicrobial use, multidrug resistance, and patient outcomes in adult intensive care units in China.
Method
We conducted a multicenter prospective cohort study with a sample of 577 patients. A total of 353 patients were included under a pharmacist-driven antimicrobial stewardship program, whereas the remaining 224 patients served as controls. The primary outcome was all-cause hospital mortality.
Results
The pharmacist-driven antimicrobial stewardship program had a lower hospital mortality rate compared with the nonpharmacist program (19.3% vs 29.0%; P = .007). Furthermore, logistic regression analysis indicated that the pharmacist-driven program independently predicted hospital mortality (odds ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.36-0.91; P = .017) after adjustment. Meanwhile, this strategy had a lower rate of multidrug resistance (23.8% vs 31.7%; P = .037). Moreover, the strategy optimized antimicrobial use, such as having a shorter duration of empirical antimicrobial therapy (2.7 days; interquartile range [IQR], 1.7-4.6 vs 3.0; IQR, 1.9-6.2; P = .002) and accumulated duration of antimicrobial treatment (4.0; IQR, 2.0-7.0 vs 5.0; IQR, 3.0-9.5; P = .030).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) surveillance definitions are the most widely used criteria for health care-associated infection (HAI) surveillance. NHSN participants agree to conduct surveillance in accordance with the NHSN protocol and criteria. To assess the application of these standardized surveillance specifications and offer infection preventionists (IPs) opportunities for ongoing education, a series of case studies, with questions related to NHSN definitions and criteria were published.
Methods
Beginning in 2010, case studies with multiple-choice questions based on standard surveillance criteria and protocols were written and published in the American Journal of Infection Control with a link to an online survey. Participants anonymously submitted their responses before receiving the correct answers.
Results
The 22 case studies had 7,950 respondents who provided 27,790 responses to 75 questions during the first 6 years. Correct responses were selected 62.5% of the time (17,376 out of 27,290), but ranged widely (16%-87%).

abstract = "Background
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a challenge for public health, and community-acquired (CA) infections seem to be increasing among people in different areas.
Methods
A total of 700 healthy student volunteers residing in dormitories of universities in Urmia, Iran, were enrolled in this study. After identification of the isolates, antibiotic susceptibility, presence of mecA and pvl genes, and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing were evaluated.
Results
Nasal screening identified 137 (19.6%) carriers of S aureus, and 18 (13.14%) were MRSA isolates. The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of isolates revealed high resistance to penicillin (93.4%). All isolates were sensitive to vancomycin. The SCCmec typing showed that most MRSA strains belonged to SCCmec type IV (n = 14; 77.8%). Only 1 (5.56%) MRSA isolates carried the pvl gene.
Conclusions
Our findings revealed the relatively high frequency of S aureus nasal carriers and the advent of multidrug resistance among these isolates. Most MRSA isolates were SCCmec type IV; the transfer of such MRSA strains from carriers to other individuals in crowded living conditions such as dormitories can act as a risk factor for outbreak of CA MRSA and is a serious threat for the study groups."

The lack of user-friendly, accessible, and visible hand sanitizing stations (HSSs) in health care environments are significant factors affecting low hand hygiene compliance rates among caregivers.
Objective
To determine whether the simulated parameters of visibility and global traffic flow score for an HSS can influence the frequency of use of that HSS.
Methods
Space syntax was used to measure virtual simulation of spatial layouts of 3 units to provide quantitative visibility and global traffic flow scores for each HSS. The frequency of use of HSSs was measured for 2 weeks in 3 units in a community hospital through electronic tracking with self-developed motion sensors. Behavioral observations were also conducted during the same period to validate hand hygiene data obtained through electronic tracking. Linear models were used to tests how much variance in use is accounted for when visibility and/or global traffic flow are included in the model.
Results
When the visibility score for an HSS increases (decrease), frequency of use of the HSS will increase (decrease) (F [5, 65] = 13.877; P < .001). When the global traffic flow score for an HSS increases (decrease), frequency of use of the HSS will increase (decrease) (F [5, 65] = 13.877; P < .001).
Conclusions
This study proposed and validated a novel approach of using space syntax simulations to predict and optimize hand hygiene behavior."

Health care–associated infections are one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). This study identified health care providers' perspectives for providing quality infection control measures at a NICU.
Methods
A qualitative approach was adopted. Participants were selected via a purposive sampling technique. The study group was composed of 3 medical staff who held leadership positions and 10 nurses working in the NICU at Cairo University Hospital. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews.
Results
Responses were analyzed using a thematic content analysis. The priorities identified by thematic analysis were suggestions and barriers for providing quality infection control measures, from the perspectives of health care providers. All interviewees cited shortage in staffing, especially nurses, lack of time to apply infection control standards, limited opportunities for infection control training, and work overload as the main barriers. All interviewees recommended on-going training and the introduction of audiovisual aids and case study approaches.
Conclusions
Lack of time to apply infection control standards, limited opportunities for infection control training, and work overload are the most commonly perceived barriers. The current infection control system in the NICU is likely to remain ineffective unless these underlying barriers are adequately addressed."

Quality improvement fellowships are 1 approach to expand the capacity of dedicated leaders and infection prevention champions.
Methods
The fellowship used a model that expanded collaboration among disciplines and focused on partnership by recruiting a diverse cohort of fellows and by providing 1-on-1 mentoring to enhance leadership development. The curriculum supported the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Prevention Competency Model in 2 domains: leadership and performance improvement and implementation science.
Results
The fellowship was successful. The fellows and mentors had self-reported high level of satisfaction, fellows' knowledge increased, and they demonstrated leadership, quality improvement, and implementation science competency within the completed capstone projects.
Conclusions
A model encompassing diverse educational topics, discussions, workshops, and mentorship can serve as a template for developing infection prevention champions. Although this project focused on CAUTI, this template can be used in a variety of settings and applied to a range of other HAIs and performance improvement projects."

Anesthesia workstations (AWs) are a reservoir for pathogenic organisms potentially associated with surgical site infections. This study examined the effectiveness of the Tru-D SmartUVC device (Tru-D LLC, Nashville, TN) on bioburden reduction (BR) on AWs.
Methods
Strips of tissue inoculated with a known concentration of either Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, or Acinetobacter sp were placed on 22 high-touch surfaces of an AW. Half of the AW surfaces received direct ultraviolet (UV) light exposure and half received indirect exposure. Two inoculated strips, in sterile tubes outside of the room, represented the control. Trials were conducted on AWs in an operating room and a small room. Strips were placed in a saline solution, vortexed, and plated on blood agar to assess BR by the number of colony forming units.
Results
All experimental trials, compared with controls, exhibited a BR >99%. There was a significantly greater reduction of E faecalis colony forming units in the operating room AW under direct exposure (P = .019) compared with indirect exposure. There was no significant difference in reduction when comparing AWs between rooms.
Conclusion
Regardless of room size and exposure type, automated UV-C treatment greatly influences BR on AW high-touch surfaces. Hospitals instituting an automated UV-C system as an infection prevention adjunct should consider utilizing it in operating rooms for BR as part of a horizontal infection prevention surgical site infection-reduction strategy."

The studies enumerating the risk of HIV transmission to health care workers (HCWs) as 0.3% after percutaneous exposure to HIV-positive blood, and 0.09% after a mucous membrane exposure, are weakened by dated literature. Our study aims to demonstrate the seroconversion rate after exposure to HIV-contaminated body fluids in a major academic center in the United States.
Methods
A prospectively maintained database of reported occupational injuries occurring between 2002 and 2015 at an academic medical center was analyzed. Data collected included the type of injury, injured body part, type of fluid, contamination of sharps, involvement of resident physicians, use of postexposure prophylaxis, and patients' HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus status.
Results
A total of 266 cases were included in the study. Most exposures were caused by percutaneous injuries (52.6%), followed by 43.2% mucocutaneous injuries. Of the injuries, 52.6% were to the hand and 33.5% to the face and neck. Blood exposure accounted for 64.3% of all cases. Of the patients, 21.1% received postexposure prophylaxis. None of the HCWs exposed to HIV-contaminated body fluids seroconverted (seroconversion rate, 0%).
Conclusions
HIV does not seem to be as easily transmitted by needlestick, laceration, or splash injuries as previously surmised. Further large-scale and multicenter studies are needed for a more accurate estimation of the risk of transmission of HIV in U.S. health care workers."

People living with HIV (PLWH) have a higher prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization and likelihood of recurrent infection than the general population. Simultaneously treating MRSA-colonized household members may improve success with MRSA decolonization strategies. This article describes a pilot trial testing household-level MRSA decolonization and documents methodologic and pragmatic challenges of this approach.
Methods
We conducted a randomized controlled trial of individual versus individual-plus-household MRSA decolonization to reduce recurrent MRSA. PLWH with a history of MRSA who are patients of an urban HIV clinic received a standard MRSA decolonization regimen. MRSA colonization at 6 months was the primary outcome.
Results
One hundred sixty-six patients were referred for MRSA screening; 77 (46%) enrolled. Of those, 28 (36%) were colonized with MRSA and identified risk factors consistent with the published literature. Eighteen were randomized and 13 households completed the study.
Conclusions
This is the first study to report on a household-level MRSA decolonization among PLWH. Challenges included provider referral, HIV stigma, confidentiality concerns over enrolling households, and dynamic living situations. Although simultaneous household MRSA decolonization may reduce recolonization, recruitment and retention challenges specific to PLWH limit the ability to conduct household-level research. Efforts to minimize these barriers are needed to inform evidence-based practice."

Many hand hygiene (HH) programs have been implemented across Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA); however, most of these have been in large, referral hospitals. Our objective was to assess the impact of HH programs aimed at improving compliance at a rural hospital, and to identify unique challenges to HH sustainability.
Methods
Interventions to improve HH through providing handwashing stations, health care worker (HCW) training, and alcohol handrub were completed in 2014 and 2015. HH infrastructure, compliance, and glove use were assessed among HCWs after the intervention in 2015 and 2016. HCWs were interviewed about challenges to sustainability of HH compliance.
Results
Total HH compliance decreased 32.1% between 2015 and 2016 (P < .001). HH for patient protection was completed significantly less than HH for HCW protection in 2016, and HCWs appeared to substitute HH for patient protection with glove use. A high rate of physician turnover was associated with a larger decrease in HH compliance compared with nurses, and interviews suggested recruiting and retention of key personnel might play a role in HH sustainability. Availability of alcohol-based handrub in patient rooms decreased from 100% in 2015 to 79.5% in 2016 (P < .01).
Conclusions
Many challenges exist to sustaining HH compliance in SSA. In rural settings, difficulty recruiting and retaining trained personnel, inconsistent availability in HH infrastructure, and variability in HCW HH training may be contributing factors."

The purpose of this study was to implement a targeted antimicrobial stewardship intervention for patients with a viral respiratory tract infection.
Methods
This was a quasi-experimental before and after audit and feedback intervention of adult inpatients with a positive polymerase chain reaction for a respiratory virus in 2 acute care hospitals in Vancouver, Canada. Audit and feedback was implemented based on 2 criteria: microbiology (no positive bacterial cultures) and chest imaging (absence of pneumonia or consolidation on radiology dictation). A chart review was conducted to assess for days of antibiotics postviral diagnosis. Outcomes including length of stay, intensive care unit admission within 14 days, mechanical ventilation within 14 days, antibiotics prescribed within 14 days, Clostridium difficile infection diagnosed within 30 days, and readmission within 30 days were also reviewed in comparison with the previous year.
Results
Antimicrobial stewardship recommendations for hospitalized patients with viral respiratory tract infections were accepted for 77% of cases. This targeted approach based on easily assessed parameters translated into a 1.3-day (95% confidence interval, 0.3-2.3; P < .01) decrease in mean days of antibiotics postviral diagnosis compared with the previous year without systematic interventions. Compared with the previous year, no differences were identified for adverse outcomes associated with the intervention.
Conclusions
A targeted antimicrobial stewardship intervention integrating virology testing with the treating physician facilitated a reduction in duration of antibiotic treatment for viral respiratory tract infections."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Review included childhood immunizations among the 10 great public health achievements in the United States in the 20th century. Despite this acknowledged success, childhood immunization rates continue to be much lower in select populations. Amish communities have persistently lower immunization rates. Recent outbreaks in Amish communities include a 2014 measles outbreak in Ohio, resulting in 368 cases reported. A recent outbreak of pertussis in an Amish community in Ohio resulted in the death of a 6-week-old Amish baby.
Methods
A study was designed to determine the knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and opinions of Amish parents relative to the immunization of Amish children. Data were collected through a questionnaire. Each potential participant was mailed a copy of a letter describing the proposed study. The questionnaire, a copy of the current immunization schedule, and a return stamped envelope were also included in the mailed packet. The study sample consisted of 84 Amish individuals who voluntarily filled out and returned questionnaires.
Results
The findings from the data analysis demonstrated that fear, especially concern over too many recommended immunizations and immunizations overwhelming the child's system, was the most frequent reported reasons for not having children immunized according to recommendations.
Conclusions
Religious factors and access to care were not among reasons most reported. Designing an educational campaign for educating Amish parents on the risks and benefits of immunizations with focus on specific concerns may improve immunization rates."

Colonized patients are a reservoir for transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). Not many studies have examined the effectiveness of daily chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) bathing under routine care conditions. We present a descriptive analysis of the trends of MDRO colonization following implementation of daily CHG bathing under routine clinical conditions in an intensive care unit (ICU).
Methods
From May 2010-January 2011, we screened patients admitted to a 24-bed ICU for and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and fluoroquinolone-resistant gram-negative bacilli (FQRGNB). We calculated and plotted monthly incidence and prevalence of colonization of these MDROs.
Results
Prevalence decreased in the immediate aftermath of daily CHG bathing implementation and generally remained at that level throughout the observation period. We observed low rates of incidence of MDRO colonization with VRE>FQRGNB>MRSA. Monthly prevalence of colonization and incidence for the composite of MRSA, VRE, and/or FQRGNB was 1.9%-27.9% and 0-1.1/100 patient-days, respectively.
Conclusions
Following the implementation of daily CHG bathing, the incidence of MDROs remained low and constant over time, whereas the prevalence decreased immediately after the implementation."

Noncompliance with recommended hand hygiene and gloving practices by workers in the emergency medical services may contribute to the transmission of health care–associated infections and lead to poor patient outcomes. The aim of this study was to explore the self-reported behaviors and perceptions of Australian paramedics in relation to their hand hygiene and gloving practices in paramedic-led health care.
Methods
A national online survey (n = 417; 17% response rate) and 2 semistructured focus groups (6 per group) were conducted with members of Paramedics Australasia.
Results
Although most of the study participants perceived hand hygiene and gloving to be important, the findings suggest poor compliance with both practices, particularly during emergency cases. All participants reported wearing gloves throughout a clinical case, changing them either at the completion of patient care or when visibly soiled or broken. Hand hygiene was missed at defined moments during patient care, possibly from the misuse of gloves.
Conclusions
Paramedic hand hygiene and gloving practices require substantial improvement to lower potential transmission of pathogens and improve patient safety and clinical care. Further research is recommended to explore how to alleviate the barriers to performing in-field hand hygiene and the misuse of gloves during paramedic-led health care."

Excessive prescribing of vancomycin among patients admitted to inpatient wards is a challenge for antimicrobial stewardship programs, especially in the setting of expanded screening programs for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Studies examining factors associated with longer duration of vancomycin use are limited.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study to assess the impact of universal MRSA admission screening on duration of vancomycin use at the VA Boston Healthcare System during the period from January 2013-November 2015.
Results
A total of 2,910 patients were administered intravenous vancomycin during the study period. A clinical culture positive for MRSA was strongly associated with vancomycin administration lasting >72 hours (odds ratio [OR], 2.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.86-3.97; P < .001). After controlling for clinical culture results, admission MRSA colonization was not associated with vancomycin use past 72 hours (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.8-1.1). A negative MRSA nasal swab on admission had a high negative predictive value for all MRSA infections evaluated (99.6% for pneumonia, 99.6% for bloodstream infection, and 98.1% for skin and soft tissue infection).
Conclusions
Admission surveillance for MRSA nasal colonization is not a major driver of prolonged vancomycin use. A negative admission MRSA nasal screen may be a useful tool for antimicrobial stewardship programs to limit vancomycin use, particularly in noncritically ill patients."

abstract = "Background
One-way valves used in day use devices (used on multiple patients throughout a day without reprocessing between patients) are intended to reduce the potential for cross-contamination between patients resulting from the backflow of patient fluids. One-way valves are typically designed to withstand high levels of back pressure before failure; however, they may not be explicitly designed as a means of infection control as used in medical device applications.
Methods
Five different medical grade one-way valves were placed in low pressure configurations. After flushing in the intended direction of flow, bacteriophage, bacteria, or dye was placed patient side for 24 hours. The upstream device side of the valve was then evaluated for microbial growth or presence of visible dye.
Results
Leakage (ie, backflow) of the microorganisms occurred with a variety of one-way valve designs across a range of fluid properties tested.
Conclusions
This study describes testing of the one-way valves (component-level testing) for the potential of cross-contamination. Although day use medical device systems may use numerous other factors to prevent patient cross-contamination, this work demonstrates that one-way valves themselves may not prevent leakage of contaminated fluid if the fluid is able to reach the upstream side of the one-way valve."

However, few studies have focused on CC5 isolates in pregnant women. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and phenotypic and molecular characteristics of S aureus and methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) CC5 nasal colonization in pregnant Chinese women.
Methods
We performed a cross-sectional study between August and November 2015 in 2 hospitals in Shenzhen, China. Pregnant women were asked to complete questionnaires, and nasal swabs were collected. Log-binomial regression models were used to explore factors influencing S aureus and MRSA nasal colonization between the CC5 and non-CC5 or non–S aureus groups. Polymerase chain reaction assays were used to detect the molecular characteristics of isolates.
Results
Overall, 2,172 pregnant women were included in this study. The prevalence of S aureus and MRSA was 25.60% (n = 556) and 5.62% (n = 122), respectively. The multilocus sequence typing of S aureus isolates was diversified. A lower frequency of daily handwashing (<7) and weekly bathing (<7) were risk factors for the prevalence of S aureus (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.41 and aPR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.03-1.45) and MRSA (aPR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.23-3.14 and aPR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.21-2.44) nasal colonization in the CC5 groups of pregnant women.
Conclusions
The prevalence of S aureus and MRSA nasal colonization was moderate. The molecular characteristics of S aureus and MRSA isolates indicated possible cross-transmission among multiple resources. A higher frequency of daily handwashing and weekly bathing significantly decreased the prevalence of S aureus and MRSA CC5 nasal colonization in the pregnant women."

Catheter-associated urinary tract infection is the most common health care–associated infection, is considered avoidable, and has cost implications for health services. Prevalence is high in nursing homes, but little research has been undertaken to establish whether implementing clinical guidelines can reduce infection rates in long-term care or improve quality of urinary catheter care.
Methods
Systematic search and critical appraisal of the literature.
Results
Three studies evaluated the impact of implementing a complete clinical guideline. Five additional studies evaluated the impact of implementing individual elements of a clinical guideline.
Conclusions
Prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infection in nursing homes has received little clinical or research attention. Studies concerned with whole guideline implementation emerged as methodologically poor using recognized criteria for critically appraising epidemiologic studies concerned with infection prevention. Research evaluating the impact of single elements of clinical guidelines is more robust, and their findings could be implemented to prevent urinary infections in nursing homes."

The recognized international organizations on infection prevention recommend using an observational method as the gold standard procedure for assessing health care professional's compliance with standard infection control practices. However, observational studies are rarely used in Jordanian infection control studies. This study aimed to evaluate injection practices among nurses working in Jordanian governmental hospitals.
Methods
A cross-sectional concealed observational design is used for this study. A convenience sampling technique was used to recruit a sample of nurses working in governmental hospitals in Jordan. Participants were unaware of the time and observer during the observation episode.
Results
A total of 384 nurses from 9 different hospitals participated in the study. A total of 835 injections events were observed, of which 73.9% were performed without handwashing, 64.5% without gloving, and 27.5% were followed by needle recapping. Handwashing rate was the lowest (18.9%) when injections were performed by beginner nurses. Subcutaneous injections were associated with the lowest rate (26.7%) of postinjection handwashing compared with other routes.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates the need for focused and effective infection control educational programs in Jordanian hospitals. Future studies should consider exploring the whole infection control practices related to waste disposal and the roles of the infection control nurse in this process in Jordanian hospitals."

This study examined adherence to national recommendations on measles pre- and postexposure measures, including immunization of health care workers (HCWs) in Dutch hospitals, during a national outbreak of measles in The Netherlands. This study also investigated which hospital characteristics and organizational issues hamper implementation.
Methods
This was a cross-sectional survey among all general and academic hospitals in The Netherlands. An online structured questionnaire (48 questions) was administered. Analysis was performed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression.
Results
Of 88 hospitals, 70 (79.5%) were included. Of 68 hospitals, 48 (70.6%) assessed susceptibility to measles in HCWs. Of 70 hospitals, 61 (87.1%) offered vaccination to susceptible HCWs. Of 63 hospitals, 42 (66.7%) had postexposure policies consistent with national recommendations. Of 62 hospitals, 30 (48.4%) implemented all these measures, which is the minimum set of measures considered necessary to adequately prevent measles in HCWs. Logistic regression suggests that hospitals with several locations, hospitals with more employees, and hospitals where infectious disease experts designed infection prevention policies while occupational health experts implemented the policy less often implemented this minimum set of measures (P < .001, P < .01, and P < .001, respectively).
Conclusions
During a national measles outbreak, most hospitals took measures to prevent measles in HCWs, but less than half implemented the minimum set of measures required. Implementation strategies in hospitals need to be improved, especially in large-sized hospitals and hospitals with several locations, and with respect to the assignment of responsibilities for infection prevention policies."

The handshake represents a social custom with special importance in health care settings. However, handshakes can transmit disease and compliance with hand hygiene protocols averages <50%. We hypothesized that a handshake-free zone (HFZ) could be established within our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and would be well-received by patient families and their health care providers (HCPs).
Methods
We established an HFZ and conducted a prospective cohort study in the NICU at 2 UCLA Medical Centers. Data collection tools included questionnaires for NICU families and their HCPs.
Results
Handshake greetings occurred more frequently before than during the HFZ, as reported by HCPs (P = .0002) and patient families (P = .05). Before the HFZ, physicians were more likely than nurses to shake hands with patient families (P = .001), and believe the handshake was extremely important (P = .002); during the HFZ physicians' behaviors and attitudes shifted toward those of the nurses. All patient families and 66% of HCPs believed the NICU should consider establishing an HFZ.
Conclusions
The HFZ decreased the frequency of handshakes within the NICU. The influence of the HFZ on HCP behavior and attitudes varied with gender and profession. Patient families and most HCPs supported the implementation of an HFZ."

Hand hygiene is promoted as an effective practice to counter health care–acquired infections; however, compliance is less than optimal. Nurses have many patient contact opportunities and therefore are frequent participants in intervention research. The optimal combination of efficient and effective intervention components has not been conclusively identified.
Methods
A factorial survey research design offers an efficient method to assess multiple factors simultaneously by combining elements into vignettes. This article describes a process, grounded in the framework of Bandura's social cognitive theory, that explored environmental and individual factors that potentially influence nurses' hand hygiene behavior in acute care settings. Survey respondents consisted of nurses employed in patient care; respondents also could address an open response item.
Results
A total of 466 participants scored a total of 3,685 vignettes. Statistically significant parameters included goal, supervisor priority, electronic monitoring, and rewards. The most frequently mentioned open response item was the need to keep hand hygiene product dispensers refilled. Participants also suggested that culture and intrinsic motivation influenced hand hygiene behavior.
Conclusions
Researchers might consider assessing promising factors, especially use of goal setting, as an intervention rather than as components of an intervention. Further research is indicated to better understand how nurses define and view hand hygiene culture."

Because suspecting nurses could alter hand hygiene (HH) behavior when observed, the goal of this article was to describe how the Hawthorne effect (HE) was measured and accounted for in a direct observational prospective study.
Methods
Observations were made 8 h/d for 3-5 days in 5 intensive care units (ICUs) (4 hospitals) on a convenience sample of 64 ICU nurses in Texas. The HE was measured so if hand hygiene adherence rates of the first 2 hours were 20% higher than the last 6 hours, the first 2 hours would be dropped and an additional 2 hours would be added at the end of the observation period. Hourly rates were recorded during the observation period, using room entry and room exit.
Results
The difference between aggregated rates of the first 2 hours and last 6 hours was 0.56% (range, 0.02%-15.74%) and not significant. On 12 observation days, higher rates were observed during the first 2 hours. On 6 days, higher rates were observed in the last 6 hours, with difference in rates of 1.43% (day 1), 2.97% (day 2), and 1.42% (day 3).
Conclusions
The attempt at measuring and accounting for the HE showed little difference in HH rates throughout the observation period. Based on these results, necessity of the observer moving locations during HH surveillance after 10-20 minutes, because of a feared HE, might not be necessary."

Infection caused by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) has become a major problem in intensive care units (ICUs), with high incidence and mortality. This prospective study investigated the diagnostic value and influence of active surveillance, followed by isolation and enhanced contact precaution (IECP), on the subsequent CRAB infection and colistin use.
Methods
The study prospectively enrolled 1,115 patients who were admitted to the medical ICU of Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital between April 2011 and November 2014. Active surveillance cultures were obtained from the throat or trachea, skin, and urine. IECP was performed beginning April 2013.
Results
Active surveillance detected CRAB in 168 (15%) patients and CRAB infection developed in 70 (6%) patients. Endotracheal tube was independently associated with both CRAB colonization and infection, whereas IECP was inversely associated with both CRAB colonization and infection in multivariate analysis (all P values < .001). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of active surveillance for subsequent CRAB infection were 84%, 90%, 47%, and 98%, respectively. The rate of CRAB acquisition, CRAB infection, and the use of colistin were significantly lower during the IECP period compared with the control period (6.5 vs 34.1, 2.6 vs 14.7, and 19.9 vs 65.5 per 1,000 patient-days, respectively; all P < .001).
Conclusions
Active surveillance has good specificity and negative predictive value for subsequent CRAB infection. Active surveillance followed by IECP was inversely associated with the acquisition of CRAB and subsequent CRAB infection, and was associated with a reduction in colistin use in ICU patients."

Although integrated, electronic sepsis screening and treatment protocols are thought to improve patient outcomes, less is known about their unintended consequences. We aimed to determine if the introduction of a sepsis initiative coincided with increases in broad-spectrum antibiotic use and health care facility–onset (HCFO) Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) rates.
Methods
We used interrupted time series data from a large, tertiary, urban academic medical center including all adult inpatients on 4 medicine wards (June 2011-July 2014). The main exposure was implementation of the sepsis screening program; the main outcomes were the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics (including 3 that were part of an order set designed for the sepsis initiative) and HCFO CDI rates. Segmented regression analyses compared outcomes in 3 time segments: before (11 months), during (14 months), and after (12 months) implementation of a sepsis initiative.
Results
Antibiotic use and HFCO CDI rates increased during the period of implementation and the period after implementation compared with baseline; these increases were highest in the period after implementation (level change, 50.4 days of therapy per 1,000 patient days for overall antibiotic use and 10.8 HCFO CDIs per 10,000 patient days; P < .05). Remarkably, the main drivers of overall antibiotic use were not those included in the sepsis order set.
Conclusions
The implementation of an electronic sepsis screening and treatment protocol coincided with increased broad-spectrum antibiotic use and HCFO CDIs. Because these protocols are increasingly used, further study of their unintended consequences is warranted."

Health care workers (HCWs) are recommended to wear nonsterile clinical gloves (NSCG) for direct contact with blood and body fluids. However, there is evidence of extensive inappropriate NSCG use.
Methods
A mixed-methods study comprising observation of NSCG use in 2 acute hospitals and semistructured HCW interviews. Qualitative data were categorized using thematic analysis. Findings were mapped to the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety model and used to develop a strategy for improving NSCG use.
Results
Two hundred seventy-eight procedures performed in 178 episodes of care involved the use of NSCG. NSCG were inappropriate for 59% of procedures (165 out of 278). Risk of cross-contamination occurred in 49% (87 out of 178) episodes. Twenty-six HCWs were interviewed; emotion and socialization were key factors influencing decisions to use NSCG. Data from observation and thematic analysis were mapped to 6 interacting components of the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety work system. Interventions targeting each component informed quality improvement strategies
Conclusions
Despite intense promotion of hand hygiene as the key measure to protect patients from health care-associated infection, NSCG dominate routine clinical practice and potential cross-contamination occurs in 50% of care episodes. Such practice is associated with significant environmental and financial costs and adversely affects patient safety. The application of human factors and ergonomics to the complex drivers of inappropriate NSCG behavior may be more effective than conventional approaches of education and policy in achieving the goal of preventing health care-associated infection and improving patient safety."

We sought to determine the incidence of bacterial biofilm-based catheter-associated urinary tract infections, identify variables affecting biofilm formation, and identify etiologic bacterial pathogens and antibiotic-resistance patterns associated with biofilm-based catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) in our setup.
Methods
Patients who developed at least 2 symptoms of urinary tract infection after at least 2 days of indwelling urinary catheters were included. Urine was collected aseptically from catheter tubing and processed per standard microbiologic practices. Bacterial pathogens were identified on the basis of gram staining, colony morphology, and biochemical reactions. The detection of the biofilm was done using the tube adherence method. Drug susceptibility testing was done using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method.
Findings
Biofilm was detected in 73.4% isolates, whereas 26.6% of isolates were nonbiofilm producers. Mean duration of catheterization after which biofilm was detected was 5.01 ± 1.31 days. A latex catheter was used in 69.5% of patients, whereas a silicone catheter was used in 30.4% of patients. Escherichia coli was found to be the most common pathogen isolated (52.3%), whereas Enterobacter cloacae exhibited the highest biofilm production (87.5%) among isolated pathogens. Among biofilm producers, the highest resistance was observed with ampicillin (100%). Fosfomycin exhibited the lowest resistance (17.2%). Significant association with biofilm was detected for gender, duration of catheterization, and type of catheter.
Conclusion
Biofilm-based CAUTI is an emerging problem. E coli was the most frequent isolate. High antibiotic resistance was observed in biofilm-producing strains. Using the variables affecting biofilm formation, tailored intervention strategies can be implemented to reduce biofilm-based CAUTIs."

New Joint Commission antimicrobial stewardship requirements took effect on January 1, 2017, promoted as a central strategy for coping with the emerging problems of antimicrobial resistance and Clostridium difficile infection. Our objective was to measure the effects of a new antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) in a rural community hospital with no prior ASP, in the context of having a new infectious disease specialist on staff.
Methods
An ASP team was formed to implement a prospective audit with health care provider feedback and targeting 12 antimicrobial agents in a rural hospital in Georgia. An educational grand rounds lecture series was provided before implementation of the ASP to all prescribers. After implementation, algorithms to aid the selection of empirical antibiotics for specific infectious disease syndromes based on local antibiograms were provided to prescribers to improve this selection. Rates of C difficile infections, total targeted antimicrobial costs, and drug utilization rates were calculated for 1 year pre-ASP implementation (2013) and 1 year post-ASP implementation (October 2014-December 2015).
Results
The patient safety metric of C difficile infections decreased from 3.35 cases per 1,000 occupied bed days (OBDs) in 2013 to 1.35 cases per 1,000 OBDs in 2015. Total targeted antimicrobial costs decreased 50% from $16.93 per patient day in 2013 to $8.44 per patient day in 2015. Overall antimicrobial use decreased 10% from before the ASP initiative to 1 year after it. Annualized savings were $280,000 in 1 year, based on drug savings only.
Conclusions
Judicious use of antimicrobials and resources can improve a patient safety metric and decrease costs dramatically in rural institutions where the average hospital census is <100 patients per day. The savings would allow the institutions to spend better while improving the use of antimicrobials."

abstract = "Background
Research on treating skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) has shown improved patient outcomes with effective pharmaceutic prescribing. Antimicrobial stewardship programs can reduce consequences of broad-spectrum antimicrobial administration in SSTI treatment.
Methods
Prospective and historic control data were collected during two 7-month periods. Intervention consisted of implementing a new SSTI evidence-based treatment algorithm and provider education, including calls and medical record notes targeted at physicians.
Results
Of 412 patients, 76 and 86 were found eligible from the historic and intervention groups, respectively. The intervention group had a higher prevalence of appropriate antibiotic usage (33% vs 19%, respectively; P = .04). There was a lower median number of days from intravenous antibiotic therapy to oral conversion (3 vs 5; P < .0001) and a lower median number of days of antipseudomonal antibiotic use (3 vs 5; P = .03) in the intervention group, respectively. The intervention group also had fewer documented SSTI treatment complications (1% vs 8%, respectively; P = .04). The positive outcomes outlined demonstrate potential impacts made from the use of multidisciplinary antibiotic stewardship initiatives.
Conclusions
Appropriate use of antimicrobial agents under the direction of an antimicrobial stewardship program can lead to improved outcomes for patients being treated for SSTIs."

It is unclear if bladder catheterization and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) rates have changed since the implementation of public reporting in 2011.
Methods
We analyzed data from the Medicare Patient Safety Monitoring System, a national, chart abstraction–based surveillance system, for hospitalized adults with a principal discharge diagnosis of heart failure (HF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), or pneumonia and patients who had undergone certain major surgeries. We assessed bladder catheterization frequency (percentage of patients catheterized) and risk-adjusted CAUTI frequency (percentage of catheterized patients developing CAUTI) from 2009-2014.
Results
Bladder catheterization frequency declined significantly (6.6% for AMI patients, 8.0% for HF patients, and 5.7% for surgical patients). For pneumonia patients, there was a nonsignificant increase of 1.1%. The risk-adjusted CAUTI rate among AMI patients decreased by 9.7% each year relative to the year before. For surgical patients, the decrease was 9.1% per year. There was no significant decline among HF or pneumonia patients. The overall burden of CAUTI among surgical patients was higher than for the other conditions because surgical patients were more likely to be catheterized.
Conclusions
There were statistically significant declines in observed bladder catheterization frequency and adjusted CAUTI frequency in some patient populations between 2009 and 2014."

This study aimed to compare the compliance with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)-prevention guidelines between nurses who underwent an intensive educational program and those who did not, and to investigate other factors that influence nurses' compliance.
Method
A 2-group posttest design was used to examine the effect of the VAP-prevention guidelines education on nurses' compliance. Participants were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups.
Results
The overall nurses' compliance scores were moderate. There was no statistically significant difference in compliance between the nurses who received VAP education and those who did not (t[100] = –1.43; P = .15). The number of beds in the unit and the nurse–patient ratio were found to influence nurses' compliance.
Conclusion
Education in VAP-prevention guidelines will not improve nurses' compliance unless other confounding factors, such as their workload, are controlled. It is imperative to reduce nurses' workload to improve their compliance and enhance the effectiveness of education."

abstract = "Background
Improving surgical antibiotic prophylaxis (SAP) use is an important element in the control of antimicrobial resistance. However, compliance with SAP guidelines is unsatisfactory. This study investigated the level of compliance with SAP guidelines in neurosurgery, and institutional characteristics associated with compliance.
Methods
This study assessed surgeries in 9 Brazilian hospitals. Medical record reviews and a structured questionnaire were used to assess compliance and to describe institutional characteristics. Six attributes of compliance with SAP guidelines were evaluated; full compliance was defined whenever all these attributes were met. Logistic and linear regressions were used to investigate the association between compliance, patients, and hospital characteristics.
Results
Full compliance was 10% and was associated with weekly hours of infection control personnel per intensive care unit bed (95% CI, 0.2–0.1), hospital-wide dissemination of SAP guidelines (95% CI, 1.2–25.1), monitoring (95% CI, 1.2–25.1), and feedback of compliance rates (95% CI, 3.8–25.2). Daytime procedures had greater compliance regarding drug dose (odds ratio [OR], 3.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.72-6.65) and initial time (OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.24-4.25). Spinal procedures achieved greater compliance with initial time (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.12-3.01) and duration (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.7-2.16).
Conclusions
A low level of compliance was identified, which pointed out the need for an innovative stewardship approach to improve adherence to SAP guidelines. Targeted training programs need to be developed to ensure dissemination of guidelines among surgeons. Monitoring, feedback, and closer interaction between the infection control personnel and the surgical team are key factors for better compliance rates of SAP."

Hospital rooms play an important role in the transmission of several health care–associated pathogens. During the last few years, a number of innovative cleaning-disinfecting products have been brought to market. In this study, commercially available products combining cleaning and disinfection were compared, using 2 different application methods. The aim was to determine which product was most effective in simultaneous cleaning and disinfection of surfaces.
Methods
Seven cleaning-disinfecting wipes and sprays based on different active ingredients were tested for their efficacy in removal of microbial burden and proteins. Efficacy was tested with known Dutch outbreak strains: vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), Klebsiella pneumoniae OXA-48, or Acinetobacter baumannii.
Results
For all bacteria, ready-to-use cleaning-disinfecting products reduced the microbial count with a log10 reduction >5 with a 5-minute exposure time, with the exception of a spray based on hydrogen peroxide. Omitting the aforementioned hydrogen peroxide spray, there were no significant differences between use of a wipe or spray in bacterial load reduction. Using adenosine triphosphate (ATP) measurements, a significant difference in log10 relative light units (RLU) reduction between various bacteria (P ≤ .001) was observed.
Conclusions
In general, a >5 log10 reduction of colony forming units (CFU) for tested wipes and sprays was obtained for all tested bacteria strains, with exception of hydrogen peroxide spray and VRE. Although ATP may show a difference between pre- and postcleaning, RLU reduction does not correlate with actual CFU reductions."

The eligible studies (N = 19), published between 1996 and 2014, were summarized and the methodologic quality of each was assessed.
Results
Our review indicated evidence is available to show hand-hygiene interventions had an effect on reducing acute gastrointestinal illness-associated absenteeism but inadequate evidence is available to show an effect on respiratory illness-associated absenteeism.
Conclusions
The methodologic quality assessment of eligible studies revealed common design flaws, such as lack of randomization, blinding, and attrition, which must be addressed in future studies to strengthen the evidence base on the effect of hand-hygiene interventions on school absenteeism."

Stethoscopes may serve as vehicles for transmission of bacteria among patients. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of antimicrobial copper surfaces to reduce the bacterial concentration associated with stethoscope surfaces.
Methods
A structured prospective trial involving 21 health care providers was conducted at a pediatric emergency division (ED) (n = 14) and an adult medical intensive care unit located in tertiary care facilities (n = 7). Four surfaces common to a stethoscope and a facsimile instrument fabricated from U.S. Environmental Protection Agency–registered antimicrobial copper alloys (AMCus) were assessed for total aerobic colony counts (ACCs), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, gram-negative bacteria, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci for 90 days.
Results
The mean ACCs collectively recovered from all stethoscope surfaces fabricated from the AMCus were found to carry significantly lower concentrations of bacteria (pediatric ED, 11.7 vs 127.1 colony forming units [CFU]/cm2, P < .00001) than their control equivalents. This observation was independent of health care provider or infection control practices. Absence of recovery of bacteria from the AMCu surfaces (66.3%) was significantly higher (P < .00001) than the control surfaces (22.4%). The urethane rim common to the stethoscopes was the most heavily burdened surface; mean concentrations exceeded the health care–associated infection acquisition concentration (5 CFU/cm2) by at least 25×, supporting that the stethoscope warrants consideration in plans mitigating microbial cross-transmission during patient care.
Conclusions
Stethoscope surfaces fabricated with AMCus were consistently found to harbor fewer bacteria."

Hospital staff expressed health concerns after a surface disinfectant product containing hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, and acetic acid was introduced. We sought to determine if this product posed a health hazard.
Methods
An interviewer-administered questionnaire on work and health characteristics was completed by 163 current staff. Symptoms that improved away from work were considered work-related. Forty-nine air samples were taken for hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, and acetic acid. Prevalence ratios (PRs) were calculated using Poisson regression, and standardized morbidity ratios (SMRs) were calculated using nationally representative data.
Results
Product users reported higher prevalence of work-related wheeze and watery eyes than nonusers (P < .05). Workers in the department with the highest air measurements had significantly higher prevalence of watery eyes (PR, 2.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-7.05) than those in departments with lower air measurements, and they also had a >3-fold excess of current asthma (SMR, 3.47; 95% CI, 1.48-8.13) compared with the U.S. population.
Conclusions
This disinfectant product was associated with mucous membrane and respiratory health effects. Risks of mucous membrane irritation and asthma in health care workers should be considered in development of disinfection protocols to protect patients from hospital-acquired infections. Identification of optimal protocols that reduce worker exposures while maintaining patient safety is needed."

To inform development, targeting, and penetration of materials from a national injection safety campaign, an evaluation was conducted to assess provider knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to unsafe injection practices.
Methods
A panel of physicians (n = 370) and nurses (n = 320) were recruited from 8 states to complete an online survey. Questions, using 5-point Likert and Spector scales, addressed acceptability and frequency of unsafe practices (eg, reuse of a syringe on >1 patient). Results were stratified to identify differences among physician specialties and nurse practice locations.
Results
Unsafe injection practices were reported by both physicians and nurses across all surveyed physician specialties and nurse practice locations. Twelve percent (12.4%) of physicians and 3% of nurses indicated reuse of syringes for >1 patient occurs in their workplace; nearly 5% of physicians indicated this practice usually or always occurs. A higher proportion of oncologists reported unsafe practices occurring in their workplace.
Conclusions
There is a dangerous minority of providers violating basic standards of care; practice patterns may vary by provider group and specialty. More research is needed to understand how best to identify providers placing patients at risk of infection and modify their behaviors."

Previous studies have shown infectious diseases consultation (IDC) for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) improves management and outcomes. The influence of IDC on outcomes for SAB in addition to an antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) review for adult inpatients with SAB has not been evaluated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of IDC on SAB management with concomitant ASP review and resulting outcomes.
Methods
Adult inpatients with SAB admitted December 2012-October 2014 were included. The primary end point compared adherence to Infectious Disease Society of America guideline recommendations between patients receiving an IDC versus those not receiving an IDC. We also evaluated adherence to the individual components of the primary end point and clinical outcomes, including time to microbiologic clearance, recurrence of bacteremia, mortality, and length of stay.
Results
This study included 154 patients (115 IDC and 39 non-IDC). Guideline adherence was significantly greater in the IDC group 78% versus 46% in the non-IDC group (P < .001). Significantly more patients in the IDC group had echocardiography (91% vs 67%; P < .001) and follow-up blood cultures (92% vs 64%; P > .001). Mortality was also greater in the non-IDC group (23%) versus 5% for the IDC group (P = .001).
Conclusions
Patients with SAB receiving an IDC were more likely to receive guideline-congruent management and had significantly reduced mortality. No improvements in antibiotic choice or dosing were observed, likely a result of ASP review."

Methods
The data for this analysis come from the APIC MegaSurvey Practice and Competency domain. Descriptive statistics and χ2 analyses were conducted to examine differences in infection preventionist (IP) competency, roles, and activity self-assessments.
Results
The majority of IPs self-assessed their competency as Proficient compared with Novice or Expert for each of the 8 IP core competency activities. Forty percent of IPs self-rated their competency as Expert in the Preventing/Controlling the Transmission of Infectious Agents/HAIs component. IPs reported Novice competency in Employee/Occupational Health (29%); Cleaning, Sterilization, Disinfection, and Asepsis (23%); and Education and Research categories (22%). Differences in self-rated competency among IPs by discipline type (public health, nurse, and laboratory) were identified.

Results
Hospital-wide microbiology data from the term identified 13 case patients with P fluorescens BSI and 32 control patients with BSI due to organisms other than P fluorescens in the CCU. The case-control study revealed that the case group had significantly higher odds of exposure to only cardiac output (CO) measurement with thermodilution method (odds ratio, 22.0; 95% confidence interval, 2.4-202.3). The organism was identified only from an ice bath used for CO measurement. The susceptibility patterns were identical among all strains derived from the cases and the environment.

During 2016, approximately 140,000 individuals entered the United States as part of the federal government refugee resettlement program and established themselves in communities in virtually every state. No national database regarding refugee health currently exists; therefore, little is known about existing infectious diseases, conditions, and cultural practices that impact successful acculturation. The objective of this report is to identify what is currently known about refugees and circumstances important to infection prevention and control with respect to their roles as new community members, employees, and consumers of health care.
Methods
Using data from the University of Louisville Global Health Center's Newly Arriving Refugee Surveillance System, health issues affecting refugees from the perspective of a community member, an employee, and a patient were explored.
Results
Lack of immunity to vaccine-preventable diseases is the most widespread issue impacting almost every adult, adolescent, and child refugee resettled in Kentucky. Health issues of concern from an infection prevention and control perspective include latent tuberculosis infection, HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis, and parasites. Other health conditions that may also be important include anemia, obesity, oral health, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

The survivability of Staphylococcus aureus and spores of Aspergillus niger was compared on 5 common floor materials.
Methods
Floor materials were inoculated with a known concentration of S aureus and spores of A niger on day 0. Their survivability was measured on days, 2, 7, 14, and 28 by bulk rinsate method and enumerated using culture-based method.
Results
The difference in change of S aureus levels was statistically significant for all tested days (P < .001) for all floor materials. Vinyl composition tile (VCT) and porcelain tile (PT) had statistically similar survivability and differed statistically from carpets. On both VCT and PT, positive growth for S aureus occurred by day 2 (1-1.7 log10), declined slightly (0.1 to −0.2 log10) by day 7, and remained positive until day 28. However, S aureus was undetected by day 7 on both carpets. A niger spores were undetected on residential broadloom carpet and rubber-backed commercial carpet after day 2 but survived on VCT, PT, and wood until day 28.
Conclusions
Floor materials with hard and smooth surfaces, such as VCT and PT, can allow survival of S aureus and A niger for up to 4 weeks. It may imply that floor materials can play a major role in preserving microbial contaminants in the built environment."

The average hand hygiene compliance (HHC) rate was 64%, with 19% of the nurses participating in HH in the 60%-69% range. Male nurses had a rate of 67%, whereas female nurses had a rate of 62%. Having a HHC rate of <29%, 6% of the nurses were identified as low gelers, whereas 14% were identified as high gelers (HHC rate 80%-89%), and 13% were classified as super gelers (HHC rate 90%-100%). Four barriers to HHC were identified: carrying something in their hands, talking on mobile phones, donning gloves or personal protective equipment, and pushing or pulling the workstation on wheels; all were statistically significant. Accounting for 18% noncompliance, barriers identified present teaching opportunities to increase compliance.
Conclusions
Average HHC rates recorded during 10- to 20-minute periods with random sampling may not show the complete picture of HHC. Barriers to HHC were identified that can be used as teaching interventions."

The treatment of pulmonary infections is one of the largest indications for antibiotics in human health care, offering significant potential for antibiotic optimization internationally. This study explores the perspectives of pulmonary clinicians on antibiotic use in hospital pulmonary infections.
Methods
Twenty-eight pulmonary doctors and nurses from 2 hospitals participated in semi-structured interviews focusing on their experiences of antibiotic use.
Results
Barriers to antibiotic optimization in pulmonary infections were identified. Clinical barriers are as follows. The first is differentiating pneumonia vs chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: differentiating pulmonary diagnoses was reported as challenging, leading to overtreatment. The second is differentiating viral vs bacterial: diagnostic differentiation was perceived to contribute to excess antibiotic use. The third is differentiating colonization vs pathogen: the interpretation of ambiguous results was reported to lead to under- or overprescribing depending on the perspective of the treating team. Social barriers are as follows. The first is the perception of resistance: antibiotic resistance was not perceived as an immediate threat. The second is the perceived value of antibiotic clinical guidelines: there was mistrust in antibiotic guidelines. The third is hospital hierarchies: hierarchical structures had a significant influence on prescribing.
Conclusions
Substantial barriers to antibiotic optimization in pulmonary infections were identified. To facilitate change in antibiotic use there must be a systematic understanding and interventions to address specific clinical issues. In the case of pulmonary medicine, significant identified issues, such as mistrust in clinical guidelines and diagnostic challenges, need to be addressed."

Hydrogen peroxide–based, low-temperature sterilization has been shown to do less damage to medical instruments than steam autoclaves. However, low-temperature systems are more expensive to run. Higher costs need to be balanced against savings from reduced repair costs to determine value for money when choosing how to sterilize certain instruments, which are able to be reprocessed in either system.
Methods
This analysis examines the economic effects of using low-temperature sterilization systems to reprocess rigid and semi-rigid endoscopes, which are sensitive to heat and moisture, but still able to be sterilized using steam. It examines the changes to costs and frequency of repairs expected over 10 years, resulting from a choice to sterilize these instruments in a low-temperature system instead of steam.
Results
Overall, the results showed that increased sterilization costs are outweighed by the savings associated with less frequent repairs. Over a 10-year period, in large health care facilities, the probability of achieving an internal rate of return of at least 6% is 0.81.
Conclusions
Our model shows it is likely to be a good decision for large health care facilities to invest in low-temperature sterilization systems."

Methods
We reviewed the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online/PubMed, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, Scopus, and Web of Science databases.
Results
Two hundred sixteen articles were identified and the final sample of 9 articles was analyzed in full length. The SSI rate found in the investigations ranged between 9.6% and 35.5%. Risk factors for SSI were grouped into categories related to the preoperative period, such as Model for End-Stage Renal Disease score > 35 and ventilated support on day of transplant; to the intraoperative period activity, such as transfusion of packed red blood cells, extended surgical time, hyperglycemia >200 mg/dL, use of vasopressor drugs, and ascites flow >1 L; and to the donor/recipient relationship, such as age differences >10 years, ratio of donor liver mass to recipient body mass < 0.01. Additionally, centers that annually perform <50 transplants appear to have higher rates of SSI.

There is significant variability in personnel and infrastructural resources for infection prevention and control (IPC) among health care institutions. The aim of this study is to evaluate the current status of individual hospital-based IPC programs in the Republic of Korea (ROK).
Methods
A multicenter cross-sectional survey of 100 hospitals participating in the national surveillance programs for multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) in the ROK was conducted in September 2015. The survey consisted of 140 standardized Web-based questionnaires.
Results
The survey response rate was 41.0%. The responding hospitals are largely organized with multibed rooms, with an insufficient numbers of single rooms. Employment status of infection specialists and hand hygiene resources were better in larger hospitals. The responding hospitals had 1 full-time infection control nurse per 400.3 ± 154.1 beds, with wide variations in training and experience. Facilities have great diversity in their approach to preventing MDROs. There appeared to be no difference in supplies consumption and protocols for IPC among the hospitals, stratified according to size.
Conclusions
A greater availability of specialist personnel, single rooms, and a comprehensive IPC program, with the support of a policy-oriented management, is necessary to achieve effective IPC."

Endoscopes are well-known sources of bacterial transmission in health care facilities offering endoscopy services. The association between multidrug-resistant bacterial infections in patients who had undergone an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedure with reprocessed duodenoscopes has been much discussed. Bacterial contamination of duodenoscopes has been attributed to difficulties with reprocessing these devices, specifically the distal end of the scope, which features a movable forceps elevator. In light of a recent Food and Drug Administration warning letter to Olympus regarding their closed-channel duodenoscope model TJF-Q180V, the aim of our study was to prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of our current reprocessing procedures with regard to the TJF-Q180V duodenoscope models used in our hospital.
Methods
From August 2015-March 2016, we prospectively collected microbiologic surveillance samples from 6 TJF-Q180V model duodenoscopes in routine use at the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology using the ESwab collection system (COPAN Diagnostics Inc, Murrieta, CA).
Results
A total of 237 microbiologic samples from the forceps elevator were obtained during the survey period. None of the samples yielded microorganism growth.
Conclusion
These findings suggest that when following a diligent and validated reprocessing standard in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations, closed-channel endoscope models can still be used. Nevertheless, validated adaptions of current closed-channel duodenoscope models are needed to allow for simple and safe reprocessing. Furthermore, comprehensive postmarket surveillance needs to be established."

abstract = "Background
Antimicrobial peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) may reduce the risk of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). However, data regarding efficacy are limited. We aimed to evaluate whether antimicrobial PICCs are associated with CLABSI reduction.
Methods
MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINHAL, and Web of Science were searched from inception to July 2016; conference proceedings were searched to identify additional studies. Study selection and data extraction were performed independently by 2 authors.
Results
Of 597 citations identified, 8 studies involving 12,879 patients met eligibility criteria. Studies included adult and pediatric patients from intensive care, long-term care, and general ward settings. The incidence of CLABSI in patients with antimicrobial PICCs was 0.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.0%-0.5%), and the incidence among nonantimicrobial catheters was 5.3% (95% CI, 2.6%-8.8%). Compared with noncoated PICCs, antimicrobial PICCs were associated with a significant reduction in CLABSI (relative risk [RR], 0.29; 95% CI, 0.10-0.78). Statistical heterogeneity (I2, 71.6%; T2 = 1.07) was resolved by publication type, with peer-reviewed articles showing greater reduction in CLABSI (RR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.06-0.74). Twenty-six patients (95% CI, 21-75) need to be treated with antimicrobial PICCs to prevent 1 CLABSI. Studies of adults at greater baseline risk of CLABSI experienced greater reduction in CLABSI (RR, 0.20; P = .003).
Conclusions
Available evidence suggests that antimicrobial PICCs may reduce CLABSI, especially in high-risk subgroups. Randomized trials are needed to assess efficacy across patient populations."

A tabletop-type ultraviolet C (UVC) light–emitting disinfecting device was evaluated for microbiologic effectiveness, safety, usability, and end-user satisfaction.
Methods
Three different inoculums of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex strains suspended in both saline and trypticase soy broth were applied onto stainless steel carriers and electronic device surfaces in triplicate and cultured for growth after UVC disinfection. Assessments of functionality and usability were performed by biomedical and human factors engineers. End-user feedback was captured using a standardized in-use survey.
Results
The 54 stainless steel carriers displayed growth at inoculums as low as 102 colony forming units (CFU) when a quartz dish supplied by the manufacturer was used during UVC exposure. Without the quartz dish, 54 electronic device surfaces displayed no growth for inoculums from 102-104 CFU for all organisms suspended in saline, but lower kill rates (95.7%-100%) for organisms in broth. Several minor safety and usability issues were identified prior to clinical evaluation. In-use evaluation revealed keen user endorsement; however, suboptimal sensitivity of the machine's input sensors during sequential object insertion precluded implementation.
Conclusions
Optimization of some safety and functionality parameters would improve a conceptually popular and microbiologically effective tabletop UVC disinfecting device."

The use of catheter hub decontamination protocols is a common practice to reduce central line–associated bloodstream infections. However, few data exist on the most effective disinfection procedure prior to hub access accounting for human factors and time-dependent practices in real time in the clinical setting.
Methods
An observational design with a multimodal intervention was used in this study in a neonatal intensive care unit. Direct observations on nurse compliance of scrub times with decontamination when accessing of venous catheter and feeding tube hubs were conducted during 3 phases: (1) baseline period prior to any interventions; (2) during an educational intervention phase; and (3) during a timer intervention period when using a timing device, either an actual timer or music button.
Results
Overall, both education and the timing device interventions increased the mean scrub time ± SD of venous catheter hubs. Mean baseline scrub times of 10 ± 5 seconds were lower compared with 23 ± 12 seconds after educational intervention (P < .002) and 31 ± 8 seconds with timer or music button use (P < .001). Timer intervention scrub time was also more effective than education alone (P < .05). Similar findings were observed with scrub times of feeding tubes.
Conclusions
Time-based infection control measures, such as scrubbing the hub, must be implemented with aids that qualify specific times to account for human factors, to ensure adherence to time-dependent measures aimed at decreasing nosocomial infections."

After reaching an all time low in 2000, the rate of syphilis in the United States has been steadily increasing. Parallel benchmarking of the disease's mortality burden has not been undertaken.
Methods
Using ICD-10 classification, all syphilis-related deaths in the national Multiple Cause of Death dataset were examined for the period 2000-2014. Descriptive statistics and age-adjusted mortality rates were generated. Poisson regression was performed to analyze trends over time. A matched case-control analysis was conducted to assess the associations between syphilis-related deaths and comorbid conditions listed in the death records.
Results
A total of 1,829 deaths were attributed to syphilis; 32% (n = 593) identified syphilis as the underlying cause of death. Most decedents were men (60%) and either black (48%) or white (39%). Decedents aged ≥85 years had the highest average mortality rate (0.47 per 100,000 population; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42-0.52). For the sampled period, the average annual decline in mortality was −2.90% (95% CI, −3.93% to −1.87%). However, the average annual percent change varied across subgroups of interest.
Conclusions
Declines in U.S. syphilis mortality suggest early detection and improved treatment access likely helped attenuate disease progression; however, increases in the disease rate since 2000 may be offsetting the impact of these advancements."

Current clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) for antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are guideline- or expert-driven. They are focused on (clinical) content, not on supporting real-time workflow. Thus, CDSSs fail to optimally support prudent antimicrobial prescribing in daily practice. Our aim was to demonstrate why and how participatory development (involving end-users and other stakeholders) can contribute to the success of CDSSs in ASPs.
Methods
A mixed-methods approach was applied, combining scenario-based prototype evaluations (to support verbalization of work processes and out-of-the-box thinking) among 6 medical resident physicians with an online questionnaire (to cross-reference findings of the prototype evaluations) among 54 Dutch physicians.
Results
The prototype evaluations resulted in insight into the end-users and their way of working, as well as their needs and expectations. The online questionnaire that was distributed among a larger group of medical specialists, including lung and infection experts, complemented the findings of the prototype evaluations. It revealed a say/do problem concerning the unrecognized need of support for selecting diagnostic tests.
Conclusions
Low-fidelity prototypes of a technology allow researchers to get to know the end-users, their way of working, and their work context. Involving experts allows technology developers to continuously check the fit between technology and clinical practice. The combination enables the participatory development of technology to successfully support ASPs."

The intervention consisted of providing confidential feedback on central line audits deviations, through the systematic delivery of unit case reports and personalized nurse report cards. Analysis of central line audit deviations and subsequent report cards was undertaken.
Results
Of the 620 lines visually audited from 14 nursing units, over 16 weeks, 113 lines (19.2%) failed the audit. Each line triggered an electronic medical record audit, which identified 628 CLABSI contributing factors. Subsequently, nurse managers received 113 unit case reports and 487 bedside nurses received report cards. Over time, the frequency of CLABSI contributing factors decreased (ρ = −0.12, n = 620, P = .003).

abstract = "Background
Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most frequent health care–associated infections. One of the practices to reduce their incidence is preoperative skin antisepsis. Two of the most commonly active components used are chlorhexidine gluconate and povidone iodine. Of 3 reviews conducted between 2010 and 2012 comparing antiseptics, 2 were in favor of chlorhexidine; however, the latest was unable to draw conclusions.
Purpose
To verify whether recent evidence supports the hypothesis that chlorhexidine in preoperative antisepsis is more efficient than other antiseptics in reducing SSI rates.
Procedures
We conducted a systematic review from 2000-2014 in all languages. The primary end point was SSI incidence and secondary skin bacterial colonization.
Results
Nineteen studies were included. Meta-analysis were conducted for comparable studies for both outcomes. The results of the meta-analysis, including all of the studies in which chlorhexidine was compared with iodophor, were in favor of chlorhexidine for both SSI incidence (risk ratio [RR], 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52-0.92) and bacterial skin colonization (RR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.36-0.55).
Conclusions
There is moderate-quality evidence supporting the use of chlorhexidine for preoperative skin antisepsis and high-quality evidence that the use of chlorhexidine is associated with fewer positive skin cultures. Further rigorous trials will be welcomed to attain stronger evidence as to the best antiseptic to be used before surgery."

An HH audit was carried out October 2015-September 2016 in 18 locations for a total of 1,080 observation periods and 64,800 minutes of observation. HH complete adherence rate (HHCAR) and HH partial adherence rate were analyzed.
Results
The HHCAR, HH partial adherence rate, and nonadherence rate were 45.5%, 21.17%, and 33.3%, respectively. There was gradual statistically significant increase in monthly HHCAR during the study period from 37.5%-51.7% (P = .001). HHCAR was found to be highest among nurses (58.9%) followed by other staff (46.7%) and doctors (46.6%). World Health Organization Moments 3 and 4 had statistically significant compliance (78.5% and 71.8%, respectively; P < .001) compared with Moments 1, 2, and 5. As the HHCAR increases there is statistically significant decrease in device-associated infection rate from 10.6-3.9 per 1,000 device days (P = .042).
Conclusions
HH audit has a significant influence on HH compliance. More emphasis needs to be given on compliance with HH practice by doctors and with the World Health Organization “before” Moments, especially. HH audits should be a part of the infection control manual of every hospital."

abstract = "Background
Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) can be transmitted from patient to patient by the hands of health care workers (HCWs); however, the relative importance of this route in the spread of C difficile in the hospital is currently unknown. Our aim was to review studies examining HCWs' hand carriage and its potential role in CDI transmission.
Methods
First, English-speaking references addressing HCWs' hand sampling obtained from the PubMed database were reviewed. Second, C difficile outbreaks definitely or probably implicating HCWs were retrieved from the Outbreak Database Web site (www.outbreak-database.com). Finally, cases of C difficile occurring in HCWs after contact with an infected patient were retrieved from PubMed.
Results
A total of 11 studies dealing with HCWs' hand carriage were selected and reviewed. Between 0% and 59% of HCWs' hands were found contaminated with C difficile after caring for a patient with CDI. There were several differences between studies regarding site of hands sampling, timing after contact, and bacteriologic methods. Only 2 C difficile outbreaks implicating HCWs and 6 series of cases of transmission from patients to HCWs have been reported.
Conclusions
This review shows that HCWs' hands could play an important role in the transmission of C difficile. Hand hygiene and reduction of environmental contamination are essential to control C difficile transmission."

Computer-aided design and draft, along with computer-aided engineering software, are used widely in different fields to create, modify, analyze, and optimize designs.
Methods
We used computer-aided design and draft software to create a 3-dimensional model of an aerobiology chamber built in accordance with the specifications of the 2012 guideline from the Environmental Protection Agency for studies on survival and inactivation of microbial pathogens in indoor air. The model was used to optimize the chamber's airflow design and the distribution of aerosolized bacteria inside it.
Results
The findings led to the identification of an appropriate fan and its location inside the chamber for uniform distribution of microbes introduced into the air, suitability of air sample collection from the center of the chamber alone as representative of its bacterial content, and determination of the influence of room furnishings on airflow patterns inside the chamber.
Conclusions
The incorporation of this modeling study's findings could further improve the design of the chamber and the predictive value of the experimental data using it. Further, it could make data generation faster and more economical by eliminating the need for collecting air samples from multiple sites in the chamber."

abstract = "Background
The purpose of this study was to determine risk factors for the acquisition of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) in residents of skilled nursing facilities (SNFs).
Methods
Using the informational database provided by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), a retrospective logistic regression was performed on 1,523 urine cultures from 12 SNFs located in Long Island, New York.
Results
Of the 1,142 positive urine cultures, Escherichia coli was most prevalent. Additionally, 164 (14.4%) of the UTIs were attributed to an MDRO. In multivariate logistic regression, sex and overall quality rating predicted the occurrence of UTIs, whereas identification of MDROs was dependent on the level of nursing care received. The mean predicted probability of UTIs and receipt of contaminated samples was inversely dependent on the facility's rating, where the likelihood increased as overall quality ratings decreased.
Conclusions
The CMS's quality rating system may provide some insight into the status of infection control practices in SNFs. The results of this study suggest that potential consumers should focus on the overall star ratings and the competency of the nursing staff in these facilities rather than on individual quality measures."

To assess the ability of copper alloy surfaces to mitigate the bacterial burden associated with commonly touched surfaces in conjunction with daily and terminal cleaning in rural hospital settings.
Design
A prospective intention-to-treat trial design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of cooper alloy surfaces and respective controls to augment infection control practices under pragmatic conditions.
Setting
Half of the patient rooms in the medical-surgical suite in a 49-bed rural hospital were outfitted with copper alloy materials. The control rooms maintained traditional plastic, metal, and porcelain surfaces.
Methods
The primary outcome was a comparison of the bacterial burden harbored by 20 surfaces and components associated with control and intervention areas for 12 months. Locations were swabbed regardless of the occupancy status of the patient room. Significance was assessed using nonparametric methods employing the Mann-Whitney U test with significance assessed at P < .05.
Results
Components fabricated using copper alloys were found to have significantly lower concentrations of bacteria, at or below levels prescribed, upon completion of terminal cleaning. Vacant rooms were found to harbor significant concentrations of bacteria, whereas those fabricated from copper alloys were found to be at or below those concentrations prescribed subsequent to terminal cleaning.
Conclusions
Copper alloys can significantly decrease the burden harbored on high-touch surfaces, and thus warrant inclusion in an integrated infection control strategy for rural hospitals."

Hospital-wide multifaceted approaches can improve hand hygiene compliance in health care workers. However, the true effects of monitoring and feedback interventions are not clear.
Methods
Hand hygiene compliance was evaluated by applying direct observation techniques over 5 years (2005-2009) in a tertiary care general hospital in Japan. The observed results were periodically reported as feedback to the health care workers.
Results
The overall hand hygiene compliance rate increased from 50.8% in 2005 to 61.0% in 2006 (P = .004) and was sustained at approximately 60% through the completion of the study. The compliance rate for the indication before entering the room increased from 2005 to 2009 (P = .005). The compliance rates for 4 before patient contact indications increased from 2005 to 2009 (P = .002). The combined compliance rate for the 6 indications with the lowest compliance rates in 2005 increased from 2005 to 2009 (P = .001).
Conclusions
Direct observation and feedback methods are effective strategies that resulted in a long-lasting improvement in hand hygiene compliance that was sustained over 5 years through the completion of the study. Focusing on the procedures with high baseline noncompliance rates can be an effective way to improve the overall compliance."

Self-medication is identified by the World Health Organization as a major factor leading to antibiotics overuse, misuse and resistance. This study's objectives were to evaluate the knowledge and self-medication with antibiotics in a sample of the population of Lebanon.
Methods
This study surveyed a sample of adults (over 18 years of age) residing in 2 major cities in Lebanon about their knowledge and self-medication with antibiotics. Health care professionals were excluded from the study.
Results
Four hundred questionnaires were completed. Of the responders, 72% were between 18 and 45 years of age with an overall 86% having completed at least high school. For their knowledge about antibiotics, 61% thought that antibiotics should be taken for common cold and 83% knew that misuse of antibiotics could result in microbial resistance. Self-medication significantly correlated with a lower educational level (P = .036). Those with lower knowledge about antibiotics stopped antibiotics at the inappropriate time (P = .002). Socioeconomic status, gender and age did not correlate with self-medication.
Conclusion
Self-medication was associated with a person's educational level and knowledge of antibiotics. Awareness campaigns and enforcing medication dispensing laws are needed in to avoid self-medication with antibiotics."

Methods: During the 6-year study period, using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network (CDC-NHSN) definitions for device-associated health care-associated infection (DA-HAI), we collected prospective data from 861,284 patients hospitalized in INICC hospital ICUs for an aggregate of 3,506,562 days. Results: Although device use in INICC ICUs was similar to that reported from CDC-NHSN ICUs, DA-HAI rates were higher in the INICC ICUs: in the INICC medical-surgical ICUs, the pooled rate of central line-associated bloodstream infection, 4.1 per 1,000 central line-days, was nearly 5-fold higher than the 0.8 per 1,000 central line-days reported from comparable US ICUs, the overall rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia was also higher, 13.1 versus 0.9 per 1,000 ventilator-days, as was the rate of catheter-associated urinary tract infection, 5.07 versus 1.7 per 1,000 catheter-days. From blood cultures samples, frequencies of resistance of Pseudomonas isolates to amikacin (29.87% vs 10%) and to imipenem (44.3% vs 26.1%), and of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates to ceftazidime (73.2% vs 28.8%) and to imipenem (43.27% vs 12.8%) were also higher in the INICC ICUs compared with CDC-NHSN ICUs. Conclusions: Although DA-HAIs in INICC ICU patients continue to be higher than the rates reported in CDC-NSHN ICUs representing the developed world, we have observed a significant trend toward the reduction of DA-HAI rates in INICC ICUs as shown in each international report. It is INICC's main goal to continue facilitating education, training, and basic and cost-effective tools and resources, such as standardized forms and an online platform, to tackle this problem effectively and systematically."

abstract = "Background
Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) is a high-cost, complex nutrition support therapy that requires the use of central venous catheters. Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are among the most serious risks of this therapy. Sustain: American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition's National Patient Registry for Nutrition Care (Sustain registry) provides the most current and comprehensive data for studying CLABSI among a national cohort of HPN patients in the United States. This is the first Sustain registry report detailing longitudinal data on CLABSI among HPN patients.
Objective
To describe CLABSI rates for HPN patients followed in the Sustain registry from 2011-2014.
Methods
Descriptive, χ2, and t tests were used to analyze data from the Sustain registry.
Results
Of the 1,046 HPN patients from 29 sites across the United States, 112 (10.7%) experienced 194 CLABSI events during 223,493 days of HPN exposure, for an overall CLABSI rate of 0.87 episodes/1,000 parenteral nutrition-days. Although the majority of patients were female (59%), adult (87%), white (75%), and with private insurance or Medicare (69%), CLABSI episodes per 1,000 parenteral nutrition-days were higher for men (0.69 vs 0.38), children (1.17 vs 0.35), blacks (0.91 vs 0.41), and Medicaid recipients (1.0 vs 0.38 or 0.39). Patients with implanted ports or double-lumen catheters also had more CLABSIs than those with peripherally inserted or central catheters or single-lumen catheters. Staphylococci were the most commonly reported pathogens. These data support findings of smaller studies about CLABSI risk for children and by catheter type and identify new potential risk factors, including gender, race, and insurance type.
Conclusions
Additional studies are needed to determine effective interventions that will reduce HPN-associated CLABSI."

Patient hand hygiene may be a useful strategy to prevent acquisition of pathogens and to reduce the risk for transmission by colonized patients. Several studies demonstrate that patients and long-term-care facility (LTCF) residents may have difficulty using hand hygiene products that are provided; however, none of them measure feasibility for patients to use different hand hygiene products.
Methods
A convenience sample of 42 hospitalized patients and 46 LTCF residents was assessed for their ability to use 3 hand sanitizer products (8-oz pushdown pump bottle, 2-oz pocket-sized bottle with a reclosable lid, and alcohol-impregnated hand wipes). The time (seconds) required for accessing each product was compared among acute-care patients and LTCF residents. Participants provided feedback on which product they preferred and found easiest to use.
Results
Of 88 participants, 86 (97.7%) preferred the pushdown pump, 2 (2.3%) preferred the bottle with the reclosable lid, and none preferred the hand wipes. For both hospitalized patients and LTCF residents, the average time required to access the pushdown pump was significantly less than the time required to access the other products (pushdown pump, 0.45 seconds; bottle with reclosable lid, 3.86 seconds; and wipes, 5.66 seconds; P < .001).
Conclusions
Feasibility and ease of use should be considered in the selection of hand hygiene products for patients and LTCF residents."

Flexible endoscopes are currently reused following cleaning and high-level disinfection. Contamination has been found on endoscopes, and infections have been linked to gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urologic endoscopes.
Methods
This longitudinal study involved visual inspections with a borescope, microbial cultures, and biochemical tests for protein and adenosine triphosphate to identify endoscopes in need of further cleaning or maintenance. Three assessments were conducted over a 7-month period. Control group endoscopes reprocessed using customary practices were compared with intervention group endoscopes subjected to more rigorous reprocessing.
Results
At final assessment, all endoscopes (N = 20) had visible irregularities. Researchers observed fluid (95%), discoloration, and debris in channels. Of 12 (60%) endoscopes with microbial growth, 4 had no growth until after 48 hours. There were no significant differences in culture results by study group, assessment period, or endoscope type. Similar proportions of control and intervention endoscopes (~20%) exceeded postcleaning biochemical test benchmarks. Adenosine triphosphate levels were higher for gastroscopes than colonoscopes (P = .014). Eighty-five percent of endoscopes required repair due to findings.
Conclusions
More rigorous reprocessing was not consistently effective. Seven-day incubation allowed identification of slow-growing microbes. These findings bolster the need for routine visual inspection and cleaning verification tests recommended in new reprocessing guidelines."

Health care workers may potentially spread Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) to patients by contaminated high-touch items. We aimed to determine the pooled rates of S aureus and MRSA contamination and influencing factors.
Methods
A literature search of the PubMed, ScienceDirect, Embase, Ovid, and Scopus databases was performed. Pooled contamination rates were determined using random effect models. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were conducted to identify factors potentially influencing the rates of S aureus and MRSA contamination. Sensitivity and publication bias analyses were performed.
Results
Thirty-eight studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled contamination rates were 15.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.8%-21.1%) for S aureus and 5.0% (95% CI, 2.7%-7.7%) for MRSA. The subgroup analyses indicated that the pooled rate of S aureus contamination was significantly higher for studies conducted in South America, in developing countries, and during 2010-2015. The pooled rate of MRSA contamination was significantly higher for studies conducted in Africa. The meta-regression analysis suggested that the pooled rate of S aureus contamination was lower for studies conducted in developed countries (odds ratio, 0.664; 95% CI, 0.509-0.867; P = .004). No bias was found in the publication of the rates of S aureus and MRSA contamination.
Conclusions
S aureus and MRSA contamination statuses of high-touch items are worrisome and should be paid greater attention. Developing country status was a risk factor for S aureus contamination."

To mitigate methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections, intensive care units (ICUs) conduct surveillance through screening patients upon admission followed by adhering to isolation precautions. Two surveillance approaches commonly implemented are universal preemptive isolation and targeted isolation of only MRSA-positive patients.
Methods
Decision analysis was used to calculate the total cost of universal preemptive isolation and targeted isolation. The screening test used as part of the surveillance practice was varied to identify which screening test minimized inappropriate and total costs. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the range of total costs resulting from variation in inputs.
Results
The total cost of the universal preemptive isolation surveillance practice was minimized when a polymerase chain reaction screening test was used ($82.51 per patient). Costs were $207.60 more per patient when a conventional culture was used due to the longer turnaround time and thus higher isolation costs. The total cost of the targeted isolation surveillance practice was minimized when chromogenic agar 24-hour testing was used ($8.54 per patient). Costs were $22.41 more per patient when polymerase chain reaction was used.
Conclusions
For ICUs that preemptively isolate all patients, the use of a polymerase chain reaction screening test is recommended because it can minimize total costs by reducing inappropriate isolation costs. For ICUs that only isolate MRSA-positive patients, the use of chromogenic agar 24-hour testing is recommended to minimize total costs."

Home care (HC) aides constitute an essential, rapidly growing workforce. Technology advances are enabling complex medical care at home, including procedures requiring the percutaneous use of sharp medical devices, also known as sharps. Objectives were to quantify risks of sharps injuries (SI) in a large HC aide population, compare risks between major occupational groups, and evaluate SI risk factors.
Methods
A questionnaire survey was administered to aides hired by HC agencies and directly by clients. One thousand one hundred seventy-eight aides completed questions about SI and potential risk factors occurring in the 12 months before the survey. SI rates were calculated and Poisson regression models identified risk factors.
Results
Aides had a 2% annual risk of experiencing at least 1 SI (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.6). Client-hired aides, men, and immigrants had a higher risk than their counterparts. Risk factors among all HC aides included helping a client use a sharp device (rate ratio [RR], 5.62; 95% CI, 2.75-11.50), observing used sharps lying around the home (RR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.27-5.67), and caring for physically aggressive clients (RR, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.36-5.85).

Aspergillus fumigatus is a major opportunistic pathogen causing nosocomial infection. Hospital outbreaks of invasive aspergillosis have been associated with demolition and building construction. This study was designed to examine the impact of meteorologic factors and different periods of work on outdoor fungal airborne concentrations.
Methods
The study was conducted at Necker Enfants Malades Hospital, a 650-bed teaching care hospital recently involved in a large construction program, including renovation, construction, and demolition. During the work phases, prospective external air samplings were performed 3 times a week, and meteorologic parameters were collected every day.
Results
Two hundred and one samples were collected. Aspergillus spp were found in 80.1% of samples, with a median concentration of 16 colony forming units (CFU)/m3. A significant increase in the colony count of molds occurred after demolition. In the multivariate analysis, factors associated with overall fungi concentration were the type of work construction and temperature. Elevated Aspergillus spp concentrations (>20 CFU/m3) were associated with higher temperature.
Conclusions
Our findings underline the importance of environmental surveillance. According to our results we suggest that demolition work should be performed during the winter and fall seasons."

The availability of effective antibiotics is considered one of the most important developments in medicine. However, many organisms that were once susceptible to common antibiotics are becoming resistant. Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are considered to be vital for combating the emergence of resistance. To understand current antimicrobial stewardship practices in Kansas, the authors designed a 36-question survey. Results of this survey will be used to develop a coordinated, public health strategy for improving current practices.
Methods
To assess the number of ASPs and general antimicrobial stewardship practices in Kansas, a 36-question survey was developed and sent out to infection preventionists at all 154 acute care facilities in Kansas via e-mail.
Results
Of the 154 eligible facilities, 129 (83.7%) responded to this survey, and 61 of 127 (48%) had a formal committee devoted to antimicrobial stewardship. Acute care facilities were more likely than critical access facilities to have formal committees and were also more likely to engage in core stewardship strategies.
Conclusions
In a world with increasing microbial resistance, the role of public health in antimicrobial stewardship is becoming more important. After surveying all hospitals in Kansas about antimicrobial stewardship practices, we realize that critical access hospitals have the greatest need for support and may see the greatest opportunities for development and improvements."

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) has been linked to emergency department (ED) intubation and length of stay (LOS). We assessed VAP prevalence in ED intubated patients, feasibility of ED VAP prevention, and effect on VAP rates.
Methods
This was a quality improvement initiative using a pre/post design. Phase 1 (PRE1) comprised patients before intensive care unit (ICU) bundle deployment. Phase 2 (PRE2) occurred after ICU but before ED deployment. Phase 3 (POST) included patients received VAP prevention starting at ED intubation. Log-rank test for equality and Cox regression using a Breslow method for ties were performed. Bundle compliance was reported as percentages. Number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated by ventilator day.
Results
PRE1, PRE2, and POST groups were composed of 195, 192, and 153 patients, respectively, with VAP rates of 22 (11.3%), 11 (5.7%), and 6 (3.9%). Log-rank test showed significant reduction in VAP (χ2 = 9.16, P = .0103). The Cox regression hazard ratio was 1.38 for the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (P = .001), and the hazard ratio was 0.26 for the VAP bundle (P = .005).

Our objectives were to evaluate the utility of electronic hand hygiene counting devices in outpatient settings and the impact of results feedback on physicians' hand hygiene behaviors.
Methods
We installed 130 electronic hand hygiene counting devices in our redesigned outpatient department. We remotely monitored physicians' hand hygiene practices during outpatient examinations and calculated the adherence rate as follows: number of hand hygiene counts divided by the number of outpatients examined multiplied by 100. Physician individual adherence rates were also classified into 4 categories.
Results
Two hundred and eighty physicians from 28 clinical departments were monitored for 3 months. The overall hand hygiene adherence rate was 10.7% at baseline, which improved significantly after feedback to 18.2% in the third month. Of the clinical departments, 78.6% demonstrated significant improvement in hand hygiene compliance. The change in the percentage of physicians in each category before and after feedback were as follows: very low (84.3% to 72.1%), low (8.6% to 14.3%), moderate (2.9% to 8.9%), and high (4.3% to 4.6%), from the first to third month, respectively. Based on category assessment, 17.1% of physicians were classified as responders.

Methods
Using a retrospective cohort design, researchers investigated whether implementation of the HHCS resulted in improved hand hygiene compliance and a reduction in common HAI rates. Pearson χ2 tests were used to assess changes in compliance, and incidence rate ratios were used to test for significant differences in infection rates.
Results
During the study period, the HHCS collected many more hand hygiene events compared with human observers (632,404 vs 480) and ensured that the hospital met its compliance goals (95%+). Although decreases in multidrug-resistant organisms, central line-associated bloodstream infections, and catheter-associated urinary tract infection rates were observed, they represented nonsignificant differences.
Discussion and conclusions
Human hand hygiene observers may not report accurate measures of compliance. The HHCS is a promising new tool for fine-grained assessment of hand hygiene compliance. Further study is needed to examine the association between the HHCS and HAI rate reduction."

abstract = "Background
A severe influenza pandemic could overwhelm hospitals but planning guidance that accounts for the dynamic interrelationships between planning elements is lacking. We developed a methodology to calculate pandemic supply needs based on operational considerations in hospitals and then tested the methodology at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN.
Methods
We upgraded a previously designed computer modeling tool and input carefully researched resource data from the hospital to run 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations using various combinations of variables to determine resource needs across a spectrum of scenarios.
Results
Of 10,000 iterations, 1,315 fell within the parameters defined by our simulation design and logical constraints. From these valid iterations, we projected supply requirements by percentile for key supplies, pharmaceuticals, and personal protective equipment requirements needed in a severe pandemic.
Discussion
We projected supplies needs for a range of scenarios that use up to 100% of Mayo Clinic–Rochester's surge capacity of beds and ventilators. The results indicate that there are diminishing patient care benefits for stockpiling on the high side of the range, but that having some stockpile of critical resources, even if it is relatively modest, is most important.
Conclusions
We were able to display the probabilities of needing various supply levels across a spectrum of scenarios. The tool could be used to model many other hospital preparedness issues, but validation in other settings is needed."

Male gender and adiposity are considered to be risk factors for Staphylococcus aureus carriage. We tested whether colonization is related to free testosterone (fT) level and adiposity, measured with body mass index (BMI) and body fat percentage (BFP), in healthy adults.
Methods
Blood sample and throat swabs were taken twice (at 4-week intervals) from healthy men and women aged 18-36 years. fT level, height, weight, and BFP were measured. Participants were classified as persistent carriers, intermittent carriers (excluded from the analyses), and noncarriers. The final sample was 152 participants: 85 men and 67 women.
Results
BFP, but not BMI, correlated positively with S aureus colonization (P = .02) in men. BMI became a significant predictor of carriage only when comparing groups within and above norms (P = .04). There was no relationship for BMI nor BFP in women. Higher fT level was related to persistent carriage (P = .02) in women, there was no relationship for fT level in men.
Conclusion
Risk factors for S aureus carriage are sex dependent. Within-sex variation in colonization is related to fT level in women, whereas in men it is related to the amount of body fat."

Quality improvement is central to Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) programs. Challenges may occur when applying quality improvement methodologies like process control charts, often due to the limited exposure of typical IPs. Because of this, our team created an open-source database with a process control chart generator for IPC programs. The objectives of this report are to outline the development of the application and demonstrate application using simulated data.
Methods
We used Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap Consortium, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN), R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), and R Studio Shiny (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) to create an open source data collection system with automated process control chart generation. We used simulated data to test and visualize both in-control and out-of-control processes for commonly used metrics in IPC programs.
Results
The R code for implementing the control charts and Shiny application can be found on our Web site (https://github.com/ul-research-support/spcapp). Screen captures of the workflow and simulated data indicating both common cause and special cause variation are provided.
Conclusions
Process control charts can be easily developed based on individual facility needs using freely available software. Through providing our work free to all interested parties, we hope that others will be able to harness the power and ease of use of the application for improving the quality of care and patient safety in their facilities."

Infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality after burn injuries. Here, we describe the time line of infections and pathogens after burns.
Methods
A retrospective study was performed in a large tertiary care burn center from 2004-2013. Analyses were performed on health care–associated infections (HAIs) meeting Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria and on all positive cultures. Incidence rates per 1,000 days were calculated for specific HAI categories and pathogens and across hospitalization time (week 1, weeks 2-3, and week ≥4).
Results
Among 5,524 patients, the median burn size was 4% of total body surface area (interquartile range, 2%-10%). Of the patients, 7% developed an HAI, of whom 33% had >1 HAI episode. Gram-positive bacteria were isolated earlier, and gram-negative bacteria were isolated later during hospitalization. Of 1,788 bacterial isolates, 44% met criteria for multidrug resistance, and 23% met criteria for extensive drug resistance. Bacteria tended to become increasingly resistant to antibiotics as time from admission increased.
Conclusions
We observed differences in infection type, pathogen, and antibiotic-resistant bacterium risk across time of hospitalization. These results may guide infection prevention in various stages of the postburn admission."

Health care-associated infections are a major worldwide public health issue. Hand hygiene is a major component in the prevention of pathogen transmission in hospitals, and hand hygiene adherence by health care workers is low in many studies. We report an intervention using text messages as reminders and feedback to improve hand hygiene adherence.
Materials and methods
The study is a historical comparison proof-of-concept study. Eighteen health care workers were monitored during 12 months by a radiofrequency identification system. Afterward we sent 2 types of text messages, congratulation or encouragement, and we studied the evolution of hand hygiene adherence.
Results
We recorded 15,723 hand hygiene opportunities, 8,973 before intervention and 6,750 during and after the intervention. Using a multilevel logistic regression analysis, we found a significant increase in hand hygiene adherence during the intervention (odds ratio, 1.68) compared with the historical period.
Discussion
Despite limitations due to the type of study, a text message encouraging personnel to be more vigilant is effective in increasing hand hygiene adherence in health care workers.
Conclusions
Text message feedback should be incorporated into multimodal approaches for improving hand hygiene compliance."

The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of copper-impregnated composite hard surfaces and linens in an acute care hospital to reduce health care-associated infections (HAIs).
Methods
We performed a quasiexperimental study with a control group, assessing development of HAIs due to multidrug resistant organisms (MDROs) and Clostridium difficile in the acute care units of a community hospital following the replacement of a 1970s-era clinical wing with a new wing outfitted with copper-impregnated composite hard surfaces and linens.
Results
The study was conducted over a 25.5-month time period that included a 3.5-month washout period. HAI rates obtained from the copper-containing new hospital wing (14,479 patient-days; 72 beds) and the unmodified hospital wing (19,177 patient-days) were compared with those from the baseline period (46,391 patient-days). The new wing had 78% (P = .023) fewer HAIs due to MDROs or C difficile, 83% (P = .048) fewer cases of C difficile infection, and 68% (P = .252) fewer infections due to MDROs relative to the baseline period. No changes in rates of HAI were observed in the unmodified hospital wing.
Conclusions
Copper-impregnated composite hard surfaces and linens may be useful technologies to prevent HAIs in acute care hospital settings. Additional studies are needed to determine whether reduced HAIs can be attributed to the use of copper-containing antimicrobial hard and soft surfaces."

Consistent domestic hand hygiene can reduce diarrhea-related morbidity and mortality and the spread of other communicable diseases. However, it remains uncertain which technique of handwashing is most effective and practicable during everyday life. The goal of this study is to determine how the handwashing technique, as performed in the daily life by the participants of this case study in Harare, Zimbabwe, influences microbial handwashing effectiveness.
Methods
Handwashing technique of 173 primary caregivers was observed in their homes and hand rinse samples were collected before and after handwashing. Samples were analyzed for Escherichia coli and total coliform concentrations. Generalized linear models were used to predict fecal hand contamination after washing from observed handwashing technique.
Results
Cleaning under fingernails, scrubbing the fingertips, using soap, and drying hands through rubbing on clothes or a clean towel statistically significantly reduced E coli contamination of hands after washing. Tap use, scrubbing fingertips, and rubbing hands on clothes to dry them statistically significantly reduced total coliform contamination.
Conclusions
Recommendations for effective and practicable domestic handwashing in Harare, Zimbabwe, should include performing specific handscrubbing steps (ie, cleaning under the fingernails and rubbing the fingertips), and soap and tap use. This calls for further research to develop behavior change interventions that explicitly promote effective handwashing technique at critical times."

Peripheral intravenous cannula (PIVC) insertion is a universal intervention for inpatients and is associated with multiple complications. Effective, simple, reproducible interventions specific to PIVC complication prevention are few and often extrapolated from central venous catheter complication prevention strategies. The objective of this study is to improve compliance with documentation and monitoring PIVC guidelines in the medical ward of a secondary care center.
Methods
This study is a prospective run-in audit of adherence to PIVC documentation and monitoring guidelines between the dates of August 30-November 14, 2014, with data recollection from December 25, 2014-January 30, 2015, after intervention implementation. Three interventions were implemented. The Plastic in Patient (PIP) strip is a dedicated column on the journey board, identifying inpatients with PIVCs, prompting assessment of indication at daily multidisciplinary meetings. PIP row is a prompt in the medical admission proforma to review PIVC indication. PIP poster is a visual cue on PIVC trolleys highlighting PIVC management practices.
Results
Baseline demographics were similar in the pre- and postintervention groups. Documentation significantly improved in the postintervention group (36.4 vs 50%, P = .025). Early identification of nonindicated PIVCs improved in the postintervention group (88.8% vs 97.1%, P = .018) and a trend toward a reduced PIVC-related early phlebitis rate (3.7% vs 0, P = .08).
Conclusions
Simple, cost-effective interventions result in improvements in adherence to practice guidelines. Our results suggest a trend toward reduction in phlebitis rates."

Results
Of 185 participants, the median age was 47 years, and 59.5% were men. CRGNB colonization was detected in 21 (11.4%) patients. The most commonly isolated CRGNB were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Multivariate analysis revealed that busulfan use (11.9 times), fludarabine use (6.4 times), transfer from another hospital (7.8 times), transfer between units (9.3 times), and central venous catheterization (5.1 times) were risk factors for CRGNB colonization. During the study period, febrile neutropenia (FN) developed in 9 (56.2%) of the 21 colonized patients, and 1 patient died.
Conclusions
Screening of patients for CRGNB colonization may have a role in preventing the spread of CRGNB. However, the empirical antimicrobial treatment for FN in patients with CRGNB colonization did not change, and their mortality rates were similar."

However, the utility of surveillance cultures in the presumption of causative bacteria in late-onset bacterial infection has been controversial. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between the causative pathogens of late-onset bacterial infection and the results of periodic surveillance cultures in a NICU.
Methods
A retrospective study was performed on 600 patients hospitalized in the NICU of a large metropolitan hospital from 2010-2013. The correspondence of the results of surveillance cultures with causative pathogens was analyzed in patients who developed late-onset bacterial infection.
Results
Staphylococcus species and enterobacterium were the most prevalent in the samples obtained from the oropharynx and rectum, respectively, during the investigation period. Twenty patients (3.3%) developed late-onset bacterial infection. The causative pathogens in 15 patients (75%) were also detected from the final surveillance cultures; these patients tended to be older than the other 5 patients (P = .003).
Conclusions
Surveillance cultures might be useful for the presumption of causative pathogens of late-onset bacterial infection in patients with risk factors for the development of nosocomial bacterial infection."

There are limited explorations into hospital staff reactions to automated hand hygiene surveillance or hand hygiene interventions.
Methods
An automated surveillance system with daily feedback and a behavioral intervention component was trialed in 2 wards in an Australian tertiary teaching hospital. After 9 months, 12 clinicians from each ward were interviewed prior to the completion of the trial to explore satisfaction with the system and behavioral component of nudging each other with a reminder to comply. Only on completion of the trial were transcripts analyzed for themes.
Results
Staff from the ward with improved compliance described a socially cohesive team with a well-liked nurse unit manager who accessed daily compliance rates and worked with staff to set goals. This contrasted with the ward without improvement in compliance, whose staff described their great reluctance and discomfort to nudge each other to comply and distrust of the authenticity of the rates established from the automated system.
Conclusions
Interventions for improving compliance are more likely to be successful in a ward with a social cohesive team. Patient safety interventions, in the first instance, may benefit from purposeful selection of wards with cohesive teams and skilled leaders who can transform clinicians into early adopters of the program."

To determine differences in the recontamination of stethoscope membranes after cleaning with chlorhexidine, triclosan, or alcohol.
Methods
Experimental, controlled, blinded trial to determine differences in the bacterial load on stethoscope membranes. Membranes were cultured by direct imprint after disinfection with 70% isopropyl alcohol, 1% triclosan, or 1% chlorhexidine and normal use for 4 hours. As a baseline and an immediate effect control, bacterial load of membranes without disinfection and after 1 minute of disinfection with isopropyl alcohol was determined as well.
Results
Three hundred seventy cultures of in-use stethoscopes were taken, 74 from each arm. In the baseline arm the median growth was 10 CFU (interquartile range [IQR], 32-42 CFU); meanwhile, in the isopropyl alcohol immediate-effect arm it was 0 CFU (IQR, 0-0 CFU). In the arms cultured after 4 hours, a median growth of 8 CFU (IQR, 1-28 CFU) in the isopropyl alcohol arm, 4 CFU (IQR, 0-17 CFU) in the triclosan arm, and 0 CFU (IQR, 0-1 CFU) in the chlorhexidine arm were seen. No significant differences were observed between the bacterial load of the chlorhexidine arm (after 4 hours of use) and that of the isopropyl alcohol arm (after 1 minute without use) (Z = 2.41; P > .05).

Hand hygiene (HH) is the most important factor affecting health care–associated infections.
Methods
We introduced a World Health Organization HH campaign in October 2010. The monthly procurement of hand sanitizers per 1,000 patient days was calculated, and the monthly incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (MRSAB), classified into community- and hospital-onset (HO), was measured from a microbiologic laboratory database. Trends of MRSAB incidence were assessed using Bayesian structural time series models. A cost-benefit analysis was also performed based on the economic burden of HO MRSAB in Korea.
Results
Procurement of hand sanitizers increased 134% after the intervention (95% confidence interval [CI], 120%-149%), compared with the preintervention period (January 2008-September 2010). In the same manner, HH compliance improved from 33.2% in September 2010 to 92.2% after the intervention. The incidence of HO MRSAB per 100,000 patient days decreased 33% (95% CI, −57% to −7.8%) after the intervention. Because there was a calculated reduction of 65 HO MRSAB cases during the intervention period, the benefit outweighed the cost (total benefit [$851,565]/total cost [$167,495] = 5.08).
Conclusions
Implementation of the HH campaign led to increased compliance and significantly reduced HO MRSAB incidence; it was also cost saving."

We used videorecordings of routine care to analyze health care providers' deviance from protocols and organized follow-up interviews that were conducted by an anthropologist and a nurse.
Methods
After consent, health care workers were recorded during routine care by an automatic video remote control. Each participant was invited to watch her or his recorded behaviors on 2 different videos showing routine practices and her or his deviance from protocols, and to comment on them. After this step an in-depth interview based on preestablished guidelines was organized and explanations regarding the observed deviance was discussed. This design was intended to reveal the HCWs' subjectivity; that is, how they perceive hand hygiene issues in their daily routine, what concrete difficulties they face, and how they try to resolve them.

We selected 43 of 250 videorecordings created during the study, which allowed us to study 15 out of 20 health care professionals. Twenty out of 43 videos showed 1 or more breaches in the hand hygiene protocol. The breaches were frequently linked to glove abuse. Deviance from protocols was explained by the health care workers as the result of an adaptive behavior; that is, facing work constraints that were disconnected from infection control protocols. Professional practices and protocols should be revisited to create simple messages that are adapted to the mandatory needs in a real life clinic environment."

abstract = "Background
The role of the operating room (OR) environment has been thought to contribute to surgical site infection rates. The quality of OR air, disruption of airflow, and other factors may increase contamination risks. We measured air particulate counts (APCs) to determine if they increased in relation to traffic, door opening, and other common activities.
Methods
During 1 week, we recorded APCs in 5-minute intervals and movement of health care workers. Trained observers recorded information about traffic, door openings, job title of the opener, and the reason for opening.
Results
At least 1 OR door was open during 47% of all readings. There were 13.4 door openings per hour during cases. Door opening rates ranged from 0.19-0.28 per minute. During this time, a total of 660 air measurements were obtained. The mean APCs were 9,238 particles (95% confidence interval [CI], 5,494- 12,982) at baseline and 14,292 particles (95% CI, 12,382-16,201) during surgery. Overall APCs increased 13% when either door was opened (P < .15). Larger particles that correlated to bacterial size were elevated significantly (P < .001) on door opening.
Conclusions
We observed numerous instances of verbal communication and equipment movement. Improving efficiency of communication and equipment can aid in reduction of traffic. Further study is needed to examine links between microbiologic sampling, outcome data, and particulate matter to enable study of risk factors and effects of personnel movement."

Preoperative bathing with 4% chlorhexidine is recommended as a measure to prevent surgical site infection (SSI) despite uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of the intervention. This review aimed to assess the effect of bathing with 4% chlorhexidine on the prevention of SSIs in clean surgeries compared with bathing with placebo solution or soap.
Methods
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for systematic reviews and the Cochrane manual were followed. Sources were MEDLINE and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature databases and manual search of references from evaluated studies. We included randomized studies evaluating clean surgical wounds and reporting SSIs after preoperative bathing with 4% chlorhexidine.
Results
A total of 243 primary studies were identified and 8 were considered methodologically appropriate based on the Jadad Scale. Data were gathered from 10,655 patients. The global SSI rate was 7.2%. The SSI rate for chlorhexidine bathing, placebo, and soap without antiseptic groups was 7.1%, 9.1%, and 5.1%, respectively. A significant reduction in the infection rates was not found in the comparison between patients subjected to preoperative bathing with 4% chlorhexidine versus placebo solution (relative risk, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.76-1.09). The same absence of benefit was observed comparing chlorhexidine bathing with soap (relative risk, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.68-1.66).
Conclusions
Controlled clinical trials are needed to assess the effect of preoperative chlorhexidine bathing on infection rates following clean surgery before the incorporation of this intervention in health care services."

Very little is known about how health care personnel (HCP) actually use personal protective equipment (PPE).
Methods
The clinical PPE practices of 50 HCP from selected units at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) Presbyterian Hospital were videotaped with HCP consent. For 2 PPE simulation sessions (simple and full-body sets), 82 HCP were recruited throughout the UPMC system. Simulation practices were videotaped and examined using fluorescent powder with ultraviolet lighting. All participants completed an electronic survey. For a follow-up evaluation simulation, 12 HCP were recruited among simulation participants.
Results
Among 130 total sessions from 65 participants, contamination occurred in 79.2% of simulations during the doffing process with various PPE items: simple set (92.3%) and full-body set (66.2%). Among 11 follow-up evaluation participants, contaminations still occurred in 82% after receiving individual feedback, but the overall contamination level was reduced. Using the contamination information gained during the simulation analysis, 66% of potential contamination was estimated for the clinical observation. Concerns and barriers in PPE use from HCP survey responses were as follows: time-consuming, cumbersomeness, and PPE effectiveness.
Conclusions
Although HCP knew they were being videotaped, contamination occurred in 79.2% of the PPE simulations. Devising better standardized PPE protocols and implementing innovative PPE education are necessary to ensure HCP safety."

abstract = "Background
Switching off air handling systems in operating theaters during periods of prolonged inactivity (eg, nights, weekends) can produce a substantial reduction of energy expenditure. However, little evidence is available regarding the effect of switching off the air handling system during periods of prolonged inactivity on the air quality in operating theaters during operational periods. The aim of this study is to determine the amount of time needed after restarting the ventilation system to return to a stable situation, with air quality at least equal to the situation before switching off the system.
Methods
Measurements were performed in 3 operating theaters, all of them equipped with a unidirectional downflow (UDF) system. Measurements (particle counts of emitted particles with a particle size ≥0.5 µm) were taken during the start-up of the ventilation system to determine when prespecified degrees of protection were achieved. Temperature readings were taken to determine when a stable temperature difference between the periphery and the protected area was reached, signifying achievement of a stable condition.
Results
After starting up the system, the protected area achieved the required degrees of protection within 20 minutes (95% upper confidence limit). A stable temperature difference was achieved within 23 minutes (95% upper confidence limit). Both findings lie well within the period of 25 minutes normally required for preparations before the start of surgical procedures.
Conclusions
Switching off the ventilation system during prolonged inactivity (during the night and weekend) has no negative effect on the air quality in UDF operating theaters during normal operational hours."

Effective clinical governance is necessary to support improvements in infection control. Historically, the focus has been on ensuring that infection control practice and policy is based on evidence, and that there is use of surveillance and auditing for self-regulation and performance feedback. There has been less exploration of how contextual and organizational factors mediate an infection preventionists (IP's) ability to engage with evidence-based practice and enact good clinical governance.
Methods
A cross sectional Web-based survey of IPs in Australia and New Zealand was undertaken. Questions focused on engagement in evidence-based practice and perceptions about the context, culture, and leadership within the infection control team and organization. Responses were mapped against dimensions of Scally and Donaldson's clinical governance framework.
Results
Three hundred surveys were returned. IPs appear well equipped at an individual level to undertake evidence-based practice. The most serious set of perceived challenges to good clinical governance related to a lack of leadership or active resistance to infection control within the organization. Additional challenges included lack of information technology solutions and poor access to specialist expertise and financial resources.
Conclusions
Focusing on strengthening contextual factors at the organizational level that otherwise undermine capacity to implement evidence-based practice is key to sustaining current infection control successes and promoting further practice improvements."

The influenza vaccination rate among health care workers (HCWs) remains suboptimal. We attempted to increase vaccine uptake in HCWs by nonmandatory measures, including 1-on-1 counseling.
Methods
In 2015 we used a stepwise approach including (1) text messaging on the last day of the vaccination period, (2) extending the vaccination period by 3 days, (3) education for the low uptake group, and (4) 1-on-1 counseling for unvaccinated HCWs after the 3 interventions.
Results
There were 1,433 HCWs included. By the end of the initial 3 days, the uptake rate was 80.0% (1,146/1,433). During an extension for a further 3 days, 33 additional HCWs received the vaccine. One month after starting the vaccination, 90.1% (1,291/1,433) of the HCWs were vaccinated, but this included only 76.1% (210/276) of the doctors (lowest among HCWs). After 3 educational presentations targeted at the unvaccinated doctors, no additional individuals were vaccinated in the following 2 weeks. After 1-on-1 counseling for unvaccinated HCWs, the overall vaccination rate increased to 94.7% (1,357/1,433) in 2015, higher than in the previous year (82.5%, P < .001). Of the unvaccinated doctors, 63.2% (43/68) were vaccinated, therefore achieving 92.4% (255/276) compliance, higher than the 56.5% in the previous year (152/269, P < .001).

Stepwise intervention including 1-on-1 counseling is effective in increasing influenza vaccination rates among HCWs."

Preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis and surgical technological advances have greatly reduced, but not totally eliminated surgical site infection (SSI) posthysterectomy. We aimed to identify risk factors for SSI posthysterectomy among women with a high prevalence of gynecologic malignancies, in a tertiary care setting where compliance with the Joint Commission's Surgical Care Improvement Project core measures is excellent.
Methods
The study was a matched case–control, 2 controls per case, matched on date of surgery. Study time was January 2, 2012-December 31, 2015. Procedures included abdominal and vaginal hysterectomies (open, laparoscopic, and robotic). SSI (superficial incisional or deep/organ/space) was defined as within 30 days postoperatively, per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria. Statistical analysis included bivariate analysis and conditional logistic regression controlling for demographic and clinical variables, both patient-related and surgery-related, including detailed prophylactic antibiotic exposure.
Results
Of the total 1,531 hysterectomies performed, we identified 52 SSIs (3%), with 60% being deep incisional or organ/space infections. All case patients received appropriate preoperative antibiotics (timing, choice, and weight-based dosing). Bivariate analysis showed that higher median weight, higher median Charlson comorbidity index, immune suppressed state, American Society of Anesthesiologists score ≥ 3, prior surgery within 60 days, clindamycin/gentamicin prophylaxis, surgery involving the omentum or gastrointestinal tract, longer surgery duration, ≥4 surgeons present in the operating room, higher median blood loss, ≥7 catheters or invasive devices in the operating room, and higher median length of hospital stay increased SSI risk (P < .05 for all). Cefazolin preoperative prophylaxis, robot-assisted surgery, and laparoscopic surgery were protective (P < .05 for all). Duration of surgery was the only independent risk factor for SSI identified on multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 3.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-9.76; P = .02).
Conclusions
In our population of women with multimorbidity and hysterectomies largely due to underlying gynecologic malignancies, duration of surgery, presumed a marker of surgical complexity, is a significant SSI risk factor. The choice of preoperative antibiotic did not alter SSI risk in our study."

The quality of oral care is important in limiting the emergence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in intubated patients. Our main objective was to measure the quality improvement in oral care following the implementation of a new oral care protocol. We also monitored VAP rates.
Material/methods
This was a cohort study of patients in 5 adult ICUs covering different specialties. During period 1, caregivers used a foam stick for oral care and during period 2 a stick and tooth brushing with aspiration. Oral chlorhexidine was used during both periods. The caregivers rated improvement in oral health on the basis of 4 criteria (tongue, mucous membranes, gingivae, and teeth). Caregiver satisfaction was also assessed. The incidence of VAP was monitored.
Results
A total of 2,030 intubated patients admitted to intensive care units benefited from oral care. The patient populations during the 2 periods were similar with regard to demographic data and VAP potential risk factors. Oral health was significantly better from the third day of oral care in period 2 onward (period 1, 6.4 ± 2.1; period 2, 5.6 ± 1.8; P = .043).

We investigated the incidence and rationale for inappropriate reinsertion of urinary catheters and elucidated whether reinsertion is an independent predictor of adverse outcomes.
Methods
A longitudinal study was adopted. Patients aged ≥65 years with urinary catheters placed within 24 hours of hospitalization were enrolled. Data collection, including demographic variables and health conditions, was conducted within 48 hours after admission. Patients with catheters in place were followed-up every day. If the patient had catheter reinsertion, the reinsertion information was reviewed from medical records. Adverse outcomes were collected at discharge.
Results
A total of 321 patients were enrolled. Urinary catheters were reinserted in 66 patients (20.6%), with 95 reinsertions; 49.5% of catheter reinsertions were found to be inappropriate. “No evident reason for urinary catheter use” was the most common rationale for inappropriate reinsertion. Inappropriate reinsertion was found to be a significant predictor for prolonged length of hospital stay, development of catheter-associated urinary tract infections and catheter-related complications, and decline in activities of daily living.
Conclusions
This study indicates a considerable percentage of inappropriate urinary catheter reinsertions in hospitalized older patients. Inappropriate reinsertion was significantly associated with worsening outcomes. Efforts to improve appropriateness of reinsertion and setting clinical policies for catheterization are necessary to reduce the high rate of inappropriate reinsertion."

The true burden of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) remains largely unknown because of a lack of national and regional surveillance reports in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. The purpose of this study was to estimate location-specific CAUTI rates in the GCC region and to compare them with published reports from the U.S. National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) and the International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC).
Methods
CAUTI rates and urinary catheter utilization between 2008 and 2013 were calculated using NHSN methodology pooled from 6 hospitals in 3 GCC countries: Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Bahrain. The standardized infection ratios of the CAUTIs were compared with published reports of the NHSN and INICC.
Results
A total of 286 CAUTI events were diagnosed during 6 years of surveillance, covering 89,254 catheter days and 113,807 patient days. The overall CAUTI rate was 3.2 per 1,000 catheter days (95% confidence interval, 2.8-3.6), with an overall urinary catheter utilization of 0.78. The CAUTI rates showed a wide variability between participating hospitals, with approximately 80% reduction during the study. The overall compliance with the urinary catheter bundle implementation during the second half of the study was 65%. The risk of CAUTI in GCC hospitals was 35% higher than the NHSN hospitals, but 37% lower than the INICC hospitals.
Conclusions
CAUTI rates pooled from a sample of GCC hospitals are quite different from rates in both developing and developed countries."

The relationship between hang time and duodenoscope contamination was estimated using a calculated correlation coefficient between hang time in days and degree of contamination on the elevator mechanism and working channel.
Results
The 18 study duodenoscopes were cultured 531 times, including 465 (87.6%) in the analysis dataset. Hang time ranged from 0.07-39.93 days, including 34 (7.3%) with hang time ≥7.00 days. Twelve cultures (2.6%) demonstrated elevator mechanism and/or working channel contamination. The correlation coefficients for hang time and degree of duodenoscope contamination were very small and not statistically significant (−0.0090 [P = .85] for elevator mechanism and −0.0002 [P = 1.00] for working channel). Odds ratios for hang time (dichotomized at ≥7.00 days) and elevator mechanism and/or working channel contamination were not significant.
Conclusions
We did not find a significant association between hang time and risk of duodenoscope contamination. Future guidelines should consider a recommendation of no limit for hang time."

Infection preventionists (IPs) play key roles in preventing health care-associated infections and ensuring quality of care. To develop strategies to support comprehensive infection prevention practice, it is critical to understand key aspects of their practice.
Methods
A task force of expert IPs, staff representatives from the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC), and survey designers developed and pilot tested a survey addressing 4 components of infection prevention practice: demographic characteristics, compensation, organizational structure, and practice and competency.
Results
During mid- to late-2015, 4,078 APIC members (response rate 31%) participated in the study. Results indicated that all of the practice domains of the APIC Competency Model for the Infection Preventionist were rated as “important” or “very important” to supervisors or managers of IPs. Surveillance and investigation accounted for the most time in an IPs typical day, followed by prevention and control of transmission, identification of infection, and management and communication.
Discussion
Future analyses will examine the validity of the APIC Competency Model for the Infection Preventionist; factors related to professional development, including addressing the needs of IPs who may be ready for certification; and current compensation of IPs.
Conclusions
The results of the APIC MegaSurvey can be used to guide development of programs and initiatives for the future of infection prevention."

abstract = "Background
The standardized infection ratio (SIR) evaluates individual publicly reported health care–associated infections, but it may not assess overall performance.
Methods
We piloted an infection composite score (ICS) in 82 hospitals of a single health system. The ICS is a combined score for central line–associated bloodstream infections, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, colon and abdominal hysterectomy surgical site infections, and hospital-onset methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and Clostridium difficile infections. Individual facility ICSs were calculated by normalizing each of the 6 SIR events to the system SIR for baseline and performance periods (ICSib and ICSip, respectively). A hospital ICSib reflected its baseline performance compared with system baseline, whereas a ICSip provided information of its outcome changes compared with system baseline.
Results
Both the ICSib (baseline 2013) and ICSip (performance 2014) were calculated for 63 hospitals (reporting at least 4 of the 6 event types). The ICSip improved in 36 of 63 (57.1%) hospitals in 2014 when compared with the ICSib in 2013. The ICSib 2013 median was 0.96 (range, 0.13-2.94) versus the 2014 ICSip median of 0.92 (range, 0-6.55). Variation was more evident in hospitals with ≤100 beds. The system performance score (ICSsp) in 2014 was 0.95, a 5% improvement compared with 2013.
Conclusions
The proposed ICS may help large health systems and state hospital associations better evaluate key infectious outcomes, comparing them with historic and concurrent performance of peers."

To identify the weakest skill areas perceived by participants among key skills highly demanded during emergencies and to explore factors influencing the self-rated overall skill proficiency of public health emergency responders.
Methods
The participants were selected by a multistage, stratified cluster sampling method in Heilongjiang CDC to complete questionnaires that assessed their perceptions of health emergency response skills and techniques. A final sample of 1,740 staff members was obtained and analyzed.
Results
The 5 top skill deficiency areas perceived by participants were field epidemiologic investigation, personal protection, effective nuclear and radioactive response as well as psychological interventio (for these two areas gain the equal score), and risk assessment. The logistic regression revealed personal protective skills as the most important factor contributing to the self-rated overall skill proficiency of public health emergency responders, followed by field epidemiologic investigation skills.
Conclusions
More attention should be given to emergency response skill training and education programs. Major obstacles hindering the promotion of key skills and techniques among front-line emergency responders should be addressed urgently. Continuous efforts should be made to remove the financial, technical, and resource obstacles to improve public health emergency response capacity."

Vaccine compliance has long been a cause for concern for health authorities throughout the world. However very little effort has been made to examine parental discourse during the decision-making process.
Methods
An online survey was conducted (N = 437) to examine predictors of parents' attitudes regarding childhood vaccination.
Results
Hesitant parents were 4 times more likely to conduct intrafamily discussion regarding vaccination compared with provaccination parents (Exp[B] = 4.26). There were no significant differences between hesitant and antivaccination parents with respect to intrafamily discussion. Hesitant parents were also 4 times more likely than provaccination parents to report intrafamily disagreements regarding vaccination (Exp[B] = 4.27). They were also twice as likely as antivaccination parents to express disagreements regarding vaccination within their families (Exp[B] = 2.33). Likewise, Jewish parents were significantly more likely to define themselves as vaccination-hesitant, whereas Muslim parents were significantly more likely to be provaccination.
Conclusions
To improve the way health organizations communicate information about vaccines and increase parental trust in immunization programs, we should not only look at the level of understanding, perceptions, and biases of different groups, but also thoroughly examine parents' decision-making processes and the discourse during this process. We must communicate risk to all groups, including the provaccination group, to improve parents' decision making and the process of informed consent."

Copper oxide has potent wide-spectrum biocidal properties. The purpose of this study is to determine if replacing hospital textiles with copper oxide–impregnated textiles reduces the following health care–associated infection (HAI) indicators: antibiotic treatment initiation events (ATIEs), fever days, and antibiotic usage in hospitalized chronic ventilator-dependent patients.
Methods
A 7-month, crossover, double-blind controlled trial including all patients in 2 ventilator-dependent wards in a long-term care hospital. For 3 months (period 1), one ward received copper oxide–impregnated textiles and the other received untreated textiles. After a 1-month washout period of using regular textiles, for 3 months (period 2) the ward that received the treated textiles received the control textiles and vice versa. The personnel were blinded to which were treated or control textiles. There were no differences in infection control measures during the study.
Results
There were reductions of 29.3% (P = .002), 55.5% (P < .0001), 23.0% (P < .0001), and 27.5% (P < .0001) in the ATIEs, fever days (>37.6°C), days of antibiotic treatment, and antibiotic defined daily dose per 1,000 hospitalization days, respectively, when using the copper oxide–impregnated textiles.
Conclusions
Use of copper oxide–impregnated biocidal textiles in a long-term care ward of ventilator-dependent patients was associated with a significant reduction of HAI indicators and antibiotic utilization. Using copper oxide–impregnated biocidal textiles may be an important measure aimed at reducing HAIs in long-term care medical settings."

Hospital transmission of Clostridium difficile is fostered by contamination of surfaces and medical equipment with spores highly resistant to disinfectants and regular cleaning procedures. Despite the outbreaks and fatalities that C difficile causes, its epidemiology has not been studied in hospitals from middle- and low-income countries. To tackle this knowledge gap, the detection frequency of C difficile DNA on inert surfaces of a major Costa Rican hospital during and after an outbreak was compared.
Methods
We used a presence-absence real-time polymerase chain reaction to detect a fragment of the tpi gene of C difficile on 21 surface samples collected during an outbreak and 54 surface samples taken 2 years later at the same hospital.
Results
C difficile DNA was detected in 40% of the 75 environmental samples analyzed. Whereas 71% of the samples collected during the outbreak were positive, only 28% of the samples obtained 2 years after the outbreak gave the same result. This 2.5× ratio was maintained when the comparison was restricted to the wards that were sampled both during and after the outbreak (72% vs 35%, P = .016).
Conclusions
Our results show that environmental surfaces in the hospital analyzed are continuously being contaminated with C difficile DNA and that their level of contamination is higher during an outbreak than after it."

There are many well-established national health care–associated infection surveillance programs (HAISPs). Although validation studies have described data quality, there is little research describing important characteristics of large HAISPs. The aim of this study was to broaden our understanding and identify key characteristics of large HAISPs.
Methods
Semi-structured interviews were conducted with purposively selected leaders from national and state-based HAISPs. Interview data were analyzed following an interpretive description process.
Results
Seven semi-structured interviews were conducted over a 6-month period during 2014-2015. Analysis of the data generated 5 distinct characteristics of large HAISPs: (1) triggers: surveillance was initiated by government or a cooperative of like-minded people, (2) purpose: a clear purpose is needed and determines other surveillance mechanisms, (3) data measures: consistency is more important than accuracy, (4) processes: a balance exists between the volume of data collected and resources, and (5) implementation and maintenance: a central coordinating body is crucial for uniformity and support.
Conclusions
National HAISPs are complex and affect a broad range of stakeholders. Although the overall goal of health care–associated infection surveillance is to reduce the incidence of health care–associated infection, there are many crucial factors to be considered in attaining this goal. The findings from this study will assist the development of new HAISPs and could be used as an adjunct to evaluate existing programs."

To support the role of nurses as active proponents of antimicrobial stewardship in long-term care facilities, we developed an educational intervention consisting of a free online course comprised of 6 interactive modules. Here, we report the effect of the course on the knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes toward antimicrobial stewardship of nurses working in long-term care facilities.
Methods
We used a paired pre- and postcourse survey instrument to assess nurses' knowledge regarding the care of long-term care facility residents with infections and attitudes and beliefs regarding antimicrobial stewardship.
Results
There were 103 respondents, registered nurses or licensed practical nurses, who completed the pre- and postsurveys. Their mean knowledge scores improved from 75% (precourse) to 86% (postcourse, P < .001). After the course, nurses' agreement that their role influences whether residents receive antimicrobials increased significantly (P < .001).
Conclusions
The online course improves nurses' knowledge regarding the care of long-term care facility residents with infections and improves their confidence to engage in antimicrobial stewardship activities. Empowering nurses to be antimicrobial stewards may help reduce unnecessary antibiotic use among institutionalized older adults."

Influenza vaccines are underused.
Methods
Most (131/140) patients from a pediatric practice who were tested for influenza in the 2012-2013 season were enrolled. Medical records plus questionnaires determined vaccine and past disease histories and influenza vaccine attitudes. Influenza-negative tested cases (n = 65) and negative controls (n = 110) closely age-matched to 55 test-positive cases were compared with influenza-positive cases (n = 66) regarding prior influenza, vaccine efficacy, and limited vaccine season conflicting with birth dates and preventative visit timing to determine possible validity of reasons given for underutilization.
Results
The most common parental reason for not vaccinating was lack of perceived need. History of previous influenza was significantly (P < .0001) associated with disease. Live attenuated vaccine rates were greater in controls than in influenza patients for ages 2-18 years (P < .005) and for ages 6-18 years (P < .0001), whereas injectable vaccine rates were not (P = .30 and P = .60, respectively). Most positive cases (59%) and controls (89%) had no prior influenza.
Conclusions
Prior influenza disease may be a risk factor for infection that could influence vaccination benefit. Live attenuated influenza vaccine outperformed trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. Limited disease experience in individuals with low influenza vaccination rates, along with vaccine efficacy limitations, lends validity to some underutilization."

Enterococcus faecium causes bloodstream infection (BSI) in patients with hematologic malignancies (HMs). We studied the clinical features and outcomes of patients with HM with vancomycin-sensitive E faecium (VSE) and vancomycin-resistant E faecium (VRE) BSI and determined the genetic relatedness of isolates and circumstances associated with the upsurge of E faecium BSI.
Methods
Case-control study of patients with HM and E faecium-positive blood culture from January 2008-December 2012; cases were patients with VRE and controls were VSE isolates. The strains were tested for Van genes by polymerase chain reaction amplification and we performed pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to determine genetic relatedness.
Results
Fifty-eight episodes of E faecium BSI occurred: 35 sensitive and 23 resistant to vancomycin. Mortality was 46% and 57%, attributable 17% and 40%, respectively. Early stage HM was associated with VSE (P = .044), whereas an episode of BSI within the 3 months before the event (P = .039), prophylactic antibiotics (P = .013), and vancomycin therapy during the previous 3 months (P = .001) was associated with VRE. The VanA gene was identified in 97% of isolates studied. E faecium isolates were not clonal.
Conclusions
E faecium BSI was associated with high mortality. This outbreak of VRE was not clonal; it was associated with antibiotic-use pressure and highly myelosuppressive chemotherapy."

From March-May 2013, 3 cases of acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection were diagnosed among elderly patients residing at the same skilled nursing facility (facility A) and who received health care at hospital X during their likely exposure period.
Methods
We performed HCV testing of at-risk populations; quasispecies analysis was performed to determine relatedness of HCV in persons with current infection. Infection control practice assessments were conducted at facility A and hospital X. Persons residing in facility A on September 9, 2013, were enrolled in a case-control study to identify risk factors for HCV infection.
Results
Forty-five outbreak-associated infections were identified. Thirty cases and 62 controls were enrolled in the case-control study. Only podiatry (odds ratio, 11.6; 95% confidence interval, 2.4-57.2) and international normalized ratio monitoring by phlebotomy (odds ratio, 6.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-26.6) at facility A were significantly associated with case status. Infection control lapses during podiatry and point-of-care testing procedures at facility A were identified.
Conclusions
HCV transmission was confirmed among residents of facility A. The exact mode of transmission was not able to be identified, but infection control lapses were likely responsible. This outbreak highlights the importance of prompt reporting and investigation of incident HCV infection and the need for adherence to basic infection control procedures by health care personnel."

A delayed diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) in the hospital may lead to nosocomial exposure, placing employees and other patients at risk. A lack of prompt infection control measures for suspected cases at the time of admission may require complicated and expensive contact investigations. The purpose of this study was to estimate the person-hour costs required by infection control staff to investigate a single hospital-based TB exposure.
Methods
Electronic data were extracted from 2 tertiary hospitals and 1 community hospital in a large health care system in metropolitan New York City to identify pulmonary TB cases unsuspected at admission. All cases were reviewed by infection prevention and control (IPC) staff to identify exposures.
Results
From 2010-2014, 34 pulmonary TB cases which necessitated a contact investigation were identified. IPC staff calculated an average of 15-20 hours of work per exposure plus 30 minutes of follow-up for each exposed staff member. For exposures, time from admission to isolation averaged 3.3 days, with a mean of 41 staff exposed per patient and an approximate resource usage of 38 person-hours.
Conclusions
Contact investigations are costly to the health care system. In a low-prevalence country, such as the United States, it is still important that health care providers are trained to think TB."

The occurrence of Clostridium difficile infection is a major health-related risk. How the public and health care professionals perceive and respond to a health-related risk is shaped by socially and contextually structured evaluations and interpretations. Risk perceptions and responses are context dependent and therefore need to be understood within the context in which they are perceived and experienced.
Methods
This interpretive description study used 8 public focus groups (39 participants) and 7 health care professional focus groups (29 participants) in 2 geographic areas (an area that had experienced a C difficile outbreak and an area that had not).
Results
Both the public and health care professionals expressed varying concerns about the perceived consequences of C difficile occurring and the potential influence on emotional and physical health and well-being. In doing so, they drew upon a range of direct and indirect experiences and accounts from the media. Conceptual factors found to be important in influencing risk perceptions and responses included feelings of vulnerability, attribution of responsibility, judgments about competence, and evaluations of risk communicators.
Conclusions
If risk management and communication strategies are to achieve desired responses toward C difficile and wider risks, those responsible for managing risk must consider already established risk perceptions in addition to factors that have influenced them."

abstract = "Background
Declines in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) health care associated infections (HAIs) were previously reported in Veterans Affairs acute care (2012), spinal cord injury (SCIU) (2011), and long-term-care facilities (LTCFs) (2012). Here we report continuing declines in infection rates in these settings through September 2015.
Methods
Monthly data entered into a national database from 127 acute care facilities, 22 SCIUs, and 133 LTCFs were evaluated for trends using negative binomial regression.
Results
There were 23,153,240 intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU, and 1,794,234 SCIU patient-days from October 2007-September 2015, and 22,262,605 LTCF resident-days from July 2009-September 2015. Admission nasal swabbing remained >92% in all 3 venues. Admission prevalence changed from 13.2%-13.5% in acute care, from 35.1%-32.0% in SCIUs, and from 23.1%-25.0% in LTCFs during the analysis periods. Monthly HAI rates fell 87.0% in ICUs, 80.1% in non-ICUs, 80.9% in SCIUs, and 49.4% in LTCFs (all P values < .0001 for trend). During September 2015, there were 2 MRSA HAIs reported in ICUs, 20 (with 3 in SCIUs) in non-ICUs, and 31 in LTCFs nationwide.
Conclusions
MRSA HAI rates declined significantly in acute care, SCIUs, and LTCFs over 8 years of the Veterans Affairs MRSA Prevention Initiative."

Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are a commonly used central intravenous (IV) access device, which can be associated with significant complications. Midline catheters (MCs) are peripheral IV access devices that may reduce the need for central lines and hence decrease central line–associated bloodstream infections. The objective of this study is to compare the utilization and safety of PICCs and MCs.
Methods
This was a retrospective study comparing the use and outcomes of PICCs and MCs at a large academic medical center between January and May 2015. Data were collected using electronic medical records and IV team insertion data. Statistical software was used for analysis.
Results
A total of 206 PICCs and 200 MCs were inserted in 367 patients within the study duration. Patients with MCs were more likely to have complications than those with PICCs (19.5% vs 5.8%, P < .0001).
Conclusions
MCs were associated with a higher risk of non–life-threatening complications versus PICCs, which showed fewer but more serious complications, including bacteremia. The decision to move toward more use of MCs is not without risk. Institutions should continue to review the utilization and safety data of IV catheter use to determine the most appropriate use of these devices."

abstract = "Background
Sufficient quantities of quality air and controlled, unidirectional flow are important elements in providing a safe building environment for operating rooms.
Methods
To make dynamic assessments of an operating room environment, a validated method of testing the multiple factors influencing the air quality in health care settings needed to be constructed. These include the following: temperature, humidity, particle load, number of microbial contaminants, pressurization, air velocity, and air distribution. The team developed the name environmental quality indicators (EQIs) to describe the overall air quality based on the actual measurements of these properties taken during the mock surgical procedures. These indicators were measured at 3 different hospitals during mock surgical procedures to simulate actual operating room conditions. EQIs included microbial assessments at the operating table and the back instrument table and real-time analysis of particle counts at 9 different defined locations in the operating suites. Air velocities were measured at the face of the supply diffusers, at the sterile field, at the back table, and at a return grille.
Results
The testing protocol provided consistent and comparable measurements of air quality indicators between institutions. At 20 air changes per hour (ACH), and an average temperature of 66.3°F, the median of the microbial contaminants for the 3 operating room sites ranged from 3-22 colony forming units (CFU)/m3 at the sterile field and 5-27 CFU/m3 at the back table. At 20 ACH, the median levels of the 0.5-µm particles at the 3 sites were 85,079, 85,325, and 912,232 in particles per cubic meter, with a predictable increase in particle load in the non–high-efficiency particulate air-filtered operating room site. Using a comparison with cleanroom standards, the microbial and particle counts in all 3 operating rooms were equivalent to International Organization for Standardization classifications 7 and 8 during the mock surgical procedures.
Conclusions
The EQI protocol was measurable and repeatable and therefore can be safely used to evaluate air quality within the health care environment to provide guidance for operational practices and regulatory requirements."

abstract = "Background
Daily bathing with chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) is increasingly used in intensive care units to prevent hospital-associated infections, but limited evidence exists for noncritical care settings.
Methods
A prospective crossover study was conducted on 4 medical inpatient units in an urban, academic Canadian hospital from May 1, 2014-August 10, 2015. Intervention units used CHG over a 7-month period, including a 1-month wash-in phase, while control units used nonmedicated soap and water bathing. Rates of hospital-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) colonization or infection were the primary end point. Hospital-associated S. aureus were investigated for CHG resistance with a qacA/B and smr polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and agar dilution.
Results
Compliance with daily CHG bathing was 58%. Hospital-associated MRSA and VRE was decreased by 55% (5.1 vs 11.4 cases per 10,000 inpatient days, P = .04) and 36% (23.2 vs 36.0 cases per 10,000 inpatient days, P = .03), respectively, compared with control cohorts. There was no significant difference in rates of hospital-associated Clostridium difficile. Chlorhexidine resistance testing identified 1 isolate with an elevated minimum inhibitory concentration (8 µg/mL), but it was PCR negative.
Conclusions
This prospective pragmatic study to assess daily bathing for CHG on inpatient medical units was effective in reducing hospital-associated MRSA and VRE. A critical component of CHG bathing on medical units is sustained and appropriate application, which can be a challenge to accurately assess and needs to be considered before systematic implementation."

Evaluation and feedback is a core hand hygiene (HH) improvement strategy. The covert observation method avoids observation bias inherent to the overt method. The aim of the study was to observe HH compliance by a novel covert method in a real-world setting.
Methods
We conducted a 2-year, nationwide, prospective, observational study in teaching hospitals across Taiwan. Medical students and students who may have contact with patients in their careers were recruited as participants. A novel, shorthand notation method for covert observation was used. Observation results were reported through a study website.
Results
There were a total of 25,379 HH opportunities covertly observed by 93 observers. Overall HH compliance was 32.0%. Health care workers had the highest HH compliance for indication 4 (42.6%), and the lowest for indication 5 (21.7%). Overall handrubbing percentage was high, reaching 83.6%. The HH compliance increased significantly with an increase in the number of indications within 1 HH opportunity (P < .001).
Conclusions
The overall HH compliance by the covert observation method was low. An innovative shorthand notation method facilitated covert observation, and website reporting was demonstrated to be feasible for large-scale observation."

To increase the reach of our antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP), social media platforms, Facebook and Twitter, were used to increase internal medicine residents' (IMRs') antibiotic (Abx) knowledge and awareness of ASP resources.
Methods
Fifty-five of 110 (50%) IMRs consented to participate; 39 (71%) completed both pre- and postintervention surveys and followed our ASP on social media. Along with 20 basic Abx and infectious diseases (IDs) questions, this survey assessed IMR awareness of ASP initiatives, social media usage, and attitudes and beliefs surrounding Abx resistance. Over 6 months, IMRs received posts and Tweets of basic Abx/IDs trivia while promoting use of educational tools and clinical pathways on our ASP Web site. To compare pre- and postsurvey responses, McNemar test or Stuart-Maxwell test was used for categorical variables, and paired t test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for continuous variables, as appropriate.
Results
Of the IMRs, 98% and 58% use Facebook and Twitter, respectively. To compare pre- and postintervention, median scores for Abx knowledge increased from 12 (interquartile range, 8-13) to 13 (interquartile range, 11-15; P = .048); IMRs knowing how to access the ASP Web site increased from 70% to 94%. More IMRs indicated that they used the clinical pathways “sometimes, frequently, or always” after the intervention (33% vs 61%, P = .004).
Conclusions
Social media is a valuable tool to reinforce ASP initiatives while encouraging the use of ASP resources to promote antimicrobial mindfulness."

Clostridium difficile is the principal cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitalized patients. The aim of this study was to describe and compare length of stay (LOS), costs, and in-hospital deaths for C difficile infection (CDI) and non-CDI hospitalizations, in a cohort of middle-aged and older Australians.
Methods
We used survey data from the 45 and Up Study, linked to hospitalization and death data. We calculated the average LOS and costs per hospitalization, and the proportion of in-hospital deaths for CDI and non-CDI hospitalizations. We then compared hospitalizations with CDI as a secondary diagnosis to non-CDI hospitalizations by stratifying hospitalizations based on principal diagnosis and then using generalized linear models to compare LOS and in-hospital costs, and logistic regression for in-hospital deaths, adjusting for age and sex.
Results
There were 641 CDI hospitalizations during 2006-2012. The average LOS was 17 days; the average cost per hospitalization was AUD 12,704; and in 7.3% of admissions (47 out of 641) the patient died. After adjusting for age and sex, hospitalizations with CDI were associated with longer LOS, higher costs, and a greater proportion of in-hospital deaths compared with hospitalizations with similar principal diagnosis but without CDI.
Conclusions
CDI places additional burden on the Australian hospital system, with CDI patients having relatively lengthy hospital stays and high costs."

Methods
Surveillance cameras were used to determine HW opportunities, compliance, occurrences, and effectiveness based on child-care oriented criteria.
Results
We observed 349 HW triggering events, with 14 events per hour; a median of 2 personnel (caregivers, paraprofessional aides, or parents) were present at any given time period. Compliance was 30% (caregivers), 11% (paraprofessional aides), and 4% (parents), with an overall compliance of 22%. Between-room and between-age groups of children being cared for and compliance of caregivers and paraprofessional aides were not found to be significantly different (P < .05). For all personnel between the 10 different rooms, the median compliance was 20.2% (95% confidence interval, 8%-35%). Only 7% of personnel taking care of 2- to 3-year-old children washed their hands, the lowest compliance per age group. Of all steps in HW, paper towel usage had the highest compliance, with a 97% adherence, whereas turning off the faucet with a paper towel was the lowest at 17%.
Conclusions
Methods and strategies need to be developed to increase compliance. Current technology provides an effective means of gathering data for determining HW compliance in ECCs."

Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) after tracheal intubation under general anesthesia poses a serious threat to worldwide health care systems, especially those in developing countries. However, a significant number of studies have found inconsistent results in their investigation of the corresponding risk factors.
Methods
Relevant articles published up to September 2015 were retrieved from PubMed, Ovid, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biological Medical Database, China Science and Technology Journal Database, and Wanfang Data. The z test was used to determine the significance of the pooled odds ratio (OR). ORs and 95% confidence intervals were used to compare the risk factors of LRTI after intubation under general anesthesia.
Results
Fifteen case-control studies that included 27,304 participants were identified. We identified the following variables as independent risk factors: duration of general anesthesia >3 hours (OR, 2.45), age >60 years (OR, 2.35), normal endotracheal tube (OR, 1.63), deep intubation (OR, 2.66), unpracticed intubation (OR, 2.61), postoperative extubation time >2 hours (OR, 3.76), smoking history (OR, 3.02), chronic respiratory disease history (OR, 2.30), incomplete extubation indication (OR, 3.54), thoracic or craniocerebral surgery (OR, 1.90), and emergent surgery (OR, 2.54).
Conclusions
Eleven risk factors, including surgery, anesthesia, and health condition, were related to LRTI after intubation under general anesthesia. Given the limitations of this study, well-designed epidemiologic studies with a large sample size should be performed in the future."

abstract = "Background
Since the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic, scientific exploration of infection control is no longer restricted to microbiologists or medical scientists. Many studies have reported on the release, transport, and exposure of expiratory droplets because of respiratory activities. This review focuses on the airborne spread of infectious agents from mucus to mucus in the indoor environment and their spread as governed by airflows in the respiratory system, around people, and in buildings at different transport stages.
Methods
We critically review the literature on the release of respiratory droplets, their transport and dispersion in the indoor environment, and the ultimate exposure of a susceptible host, as influenced by airflows.
Results
These droplets or droplet nuclei are transported by expired airflows, which are sometimes affected by the human body plume and use of a face mask, as well as room airflow. Room airflow is affected by human activities such as walking and door opening, and some droplets are eventually captured by a susceptible individual because of his or her inspired flows; such exposure can eventually lead to long-range spread of airborne pathogens. Direct exposure to the expired fine droplets or droplet nuclei results in short-range airborne transmission. Deposition of droplets and direct personal exposure to expired large droplets can lead to the fomite route and the droplet-borne route, respectively.
Conclusions
We have shown the opportunities for infection control at different stages of the spread. We propose that the short-range airborne route may be important in close contact, and its control may be achieved by face masks for the source patients and use of personalized ventilation. Our discussion of the effect of thermal stratification and expiratory delivery of droplets leads to the suggestion that displacement ventilation may not be applicable to hospital rooms where respiratory infection is a concern."

The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to assess the impact of implementation of different levels of infection prevention and control (IPC) measures during an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in a large tertiary hospital in Saudi Arabia. The setting was an emergency room (ER) in a large tertiary hospital and included primary and secondary MERS patients.
Methods
Rapid response teams conducted repeated assessments of IPC and monitored implementation of corrective measures using a detailed structured checklist. We ascertained the epidemiologic link between patients and calculated the secondary attack rate per 10,000 patients visiting the ER (SAR/10,000) in 3 phases of the outbreak.
Results
In phase I, 6 primary cases gave rise to 48 secondary cases over 4 generations, including a case that resulted in 9 cases in the first generation of secondary cases and 21 cases over a chain of 4 generations. During the second and third phases, the number of secondary cases sharply dropped to 18 cases and 1 case, respectively, from a comparable number of primary cases. The SAR/10,000 dropped from 75 (95% confidence interval [CI], 55-99) in phase I to 29 (95% CI, 17-46) and 3 (95% CI, 0-17) in phases II and III, respectively.
Conclusions
The study demonstrated salient evidence that proper institution of IPC measures during management of an outbreak of MERS could remarkably change the course of the outbreak."

Soldiers with absolute intention to use hand sanitizers hold significantly different behavioral and normative beliefs than low intenders. Other soldiers create negative social pressure about using hand sanitizers, indicating that if other soldiers use hand sanitizers, they will refuse to do so. Intervention to ensure use of hand sanitizer should focus on strengthening behavioral and normative beliefs among low intenders. This should increase the overall well being of the military."

abstract = "Background
Data on clinical and economic impact of health care–associated infections (HAIs) from resource limited countries are limited. We aimed to determine epidemiology and economic impact of HAIs and cost-effectiveness of infection prevention and control measures in a resource-limited setting.
Methods
A retrospective cohort study was conducted among hospitalized patients at Siriraj Hospital, Thailand. Results from the cohort were subsequently used to conduct cost-effective analysis (CEA) to compare the comprehensive implementation of individualized bundling infection control measures (IBICMs) with regular infection control care.
Results
From February-May 2013, there were 515 hospitalizations (497 patients) with 7,848 hospitalization days. Cumulative incidence of HAIs was 23.30%, and the incidence rate of HAIs was 18.66 ± 44.19 per 1,000 hospitalization days. Hospital mortality among those with and without HAIs was 33.33% and 20.00%, respectively (P < .001). The adjusted cost attributable to HAIs was $704.72 ± $226.73 (P < .001). CEA identified IBICMs as a non-dominated strategy, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of −$20,444.62 per life saved.
Conclusions
HAI is significantly related with higher hospital mortality, longer length of stay, and higher hospitalization costs. IBICMs were confirmed to be cost-effective at Siriraj Hospital. Implementing this intervention could improve care quality and save costs."

Daily feedback from continuous automated auditing with a peer reminder intervention was used to improve compliance. Compliance rates from covert and overt automated auditing phases with and without intervention were compared with human mandatory audits.
Methods
An automated system was installed to covertly detect hand hygiene events with each depression of the alcohol-based handrub dispenser for 5 months. The overt phase included key clinicians trained to share daily rates with clinicians, set compliance goals, and nudge each other to comply for 6 months. During a further 6 months, the intervention continued without being refreshed. Hand Hygiene Australia (HHA) human audits were performed quarterly during the intervention in accordance with the World Health Organization guidelines. Percentage point (PP) differences between compliance rates were used to determine change.
Results
HHA rates for June 2014 were 85% and 87% on the medical and surgical wards, respectively. These rates were 55 PPs and 38 PPs higher than covert automation rates for June 2014 on the medical and surgical ward at 30% and 49%, respectively. During the intervention phase, average compliance did not change on the medical ward from their covert rate, whereas the surgical ward improved compared with the covert phase by 11 PPs to 60%. On average, compliance during the intervention without being refreshed did not change on the medical ward, whereas the average rate on the surgical ward declined by 9 PPs.
Conclusions
Automation provided a unique opportunity to respond to daily rates, but compliance will return to preintervention levels once active intervention ceases or human auditors leave the ward, unless clinicians are committed to change."

abstract = "Background
Although antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are uniquely positioned to improve treatment of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) through targeted interventions, studies to date have not rigorously evaluated the influence of ASP involvement on clinical outcomes attributed to CDI.
Methods
We performed a quasiexperimental study of adult patients with CDI before (n = 307) and after (n = 285) a real-time ASP review was initiated. In the intervention group, an ASP pharmacist was notified of positive CDI results and consulted with the care team to initiate optimal therapy, minimize concomitant antibiotic and acid-suppressive therapy, and recommend surgical/infectious diseases consultation in complicated cases. The primary outcome was a composite of attributable 30-day mortality, intensive care unit admission, colectomy/ileostomy, and recurrence.
Results
A higher percentage of patients in the ASP intervention group had acid-suppressive therapy discontinued (30% vs 13%; P < .01). Among patients with severe CDI, more patients in the intervention group received an infectious diseases consultation (17% vs 10%; P = .04), received appropriate therapy with oral vancomycin (87% vs 59%; P < .01), and vancomycin was initiated earlier (mean, 1.1 vs 1.7 days; P < .01). Incidence of the composite outcome was not significantly different between the 2 groups (12.3% vs 14.7%; P = .40).
Conclusions
ASP review and intervention improved CDI process measures. A decrease in composite outcomes was not found, which may be due to low baseline rates of attributable complications in our institution."

The burden of Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia is unknown despite being a major cause of mortality. We investigated national estimates of methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible S aureus (MSSA) pneumonias and predictors of in-hospital mortality and hospital length of stay (LOS).
Methods
This was a retrospective analysis of the National Inpatient Sample from 2009-2012. Adult patients with an ICD-9-CM primary diagnosis code for MRSA or MSSA pneumonia were included. Data weights were used to derive national estimates. Prevalence rates were reported per 100,000 hospital discharges, with trends presented descriptively.
Results
There were 104,562 patients who had a primary diagnosis of S aureus pneumonia, with 81,275 from MRSA. MRSA pneumonia prevalence decreased steadily from 2009 (75.6 cases per 100,000 discharges) to 2012 (56.6 cases per 100,000 discharges), with MSSA pneumonia experiencing a slight decrease. Mortality rates decreased between 2009 and 2012 for MRSA pneumonia (7.9% to 6.4%) and MSSA pneumonia (6.9% to 4.7%; P = .008). LOS was higher for MRSA (6.9-7.8 days) compared with MSSA (6.1-6.4 days).
Conclusions
The prevalence of MRSA pneumonia has decreased among hospitalized adults in the United States in recent years accompanied by improvements in mortality and LOS. Although the prevalence of MRSA pneumonia is declining, national vigilance is still warranted."

Exploring the distribution of nosocomial pathogens among different categories of intensive care units (ICUs) is critical to improving the management of health care-associated infection (HAI). Despite both single- and multicenter studies, the nature of the variations of HAIs within various ICUs remains inadequately evaluated.
Methods
Data on HAIs at our hospital during the period January 2010-December 2015 were collected from 8 ICUs, namely, respiratory, cardiovascular, neurology, neonatal, hematology, emergency, cardiothoracic surgery, and neurosurgery ICUs, at a tertiary hospital.
Results
We observed a cumulative HAI incidence of 15.6/1,000 patient-days among 6,254 cases of infection at the hospital, as well as obvious interunit variations in HAI distribution. Acinetobacter baumannii was the leading organism of infection in almost every ICU, especially in emergency, neurosurgery, and neonatal ICUs. The most common pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the cardiothoracic surgery, emergency, and neonatal ICUs; Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli in the neurosurgery, emergency, neonatal, and neurology ICUs; and Candida albicans in both neurology and emergency ICUs.
Conclusions
Our findings revealed that A baumannii and P aeruginosa were the most common pathogens associated with invasive operations, whereas K pneumoniae and E coli were the most common pathogens in the medical ICUs."

Employees in health care settings are at varying risk for bloodborne pathogen (BBP) exposures. We compared differences in reporting rates of BBP exposures among health care personnel during 2 different time periods, assessing job category, years of experience, and sex as potential predictors for exposure.
Methods
A retrospective review of the employee health department BBP database at 2 time periods (September 1, 2012-April 30, 2013, and September 1, 2013-April 30, 2014) in which 2 different reporting protocols (call center vs pager) was used. A survey was administered to assess reported and unreported exposures within a 12-month period.
Results
BBP exposures were highest among residents and lowest among students. Physicians' reporting rate doubled when the call center was no longer used (relative risk, 2.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-5.52). Percutaneous injuries were the most common (78.3%), and most occurred in the operating room or postanesthesia unit (30.8%) and patient rooms (28.9%). Of 1,105 survey respondents, 103 (9.3%) recalled some type of exposure, but only 80 (77.7%) reported these exposures. When accounting for years of experience and sex, job category was significantly associated with injury or exposure within the previous 12 months (P < .001). Risk of exposure among residents was 3 times higher (odds ratio, 3.10; 95 CI, 1.60-6.00) than nurses.
Conclusions
Risk and reporting behaviors of BBP exposures vary widely across different providers. Training and education to prevent BBP exposures may need to be tailored toward different provider types."

Hand disinfection with chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) is commonly used for preventing the spread of infection in medical institutions and the community, but studies on its use in military settings have been inconclusive. We examined the effects of CHG on morbidity in Israeli Navy ships.
Methods
This was a controlled, cluster randomized study that took place at a major naval base in Israel. Ships were randomly selected into the study (347 sailors) and primary control (350 sailors) groups. Additional nonintervention control groups included other sailors serving on the base (n = 360) and logistics and support personnel (n = 859). CHG disinfection devices were installed on all ships in the study group, alongside soap and water. Morbidity was analyzed using a computerized patient record, subjective self-report questionnaires, and a sample of hand cultures. Compliance with hand hygiene was analyzed using a self-report hygiene attitudes questionnaire at the beginning of the trial and after 3 months. The study took place between May and September 2014.
Results
No significant differences were found between the groups in terms of sick days or light-duty days or in the number of acute gastrointestinal or respiratory cases. Sailors were found to have more skin infections than controls, but this was not significantly reduced by CHG. Hand cultures demonstrated that continuous use of CHG did not cause a reduction in colonization. There were no statistically significant differences in self-reported hygiene practices.
Conclusions
CHG did not demonstrate any medical benefit over the use of soap and water onboard Israeli Navy ships."

keywords = "Infection control, Bacterial, Spread, Ulcer, Wound, Aerosol",
abstract = "Background
Low-frequency ultrasonic debridement (LFUD) is a technology that uses sound waves conducted through saline mist to debride wound tissue. Whilst this technology purportedly reduces wound-healing times, the airborne mist generated is potentially problematic. Theoretically, the saline mist could carry an increased number of microbes into the surrounding environment, posing an infection control risk to the patient, clinician, and clinical environment. This research aimed to establish the degree and extent to which there is microbial spread during the use of, and following the use of, LFUD. The total number of colony forming units was identified for use of LFUD without the suction attachment (control) and with the suction attachment (intervention).
Methods
This was a prospective, observational study with repeated measures across each treatment (before, during, and after). Quota sampling in a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design was undertaken so that half of the 24 treatments were conducted at each health service (Monash Health vs Peninsula Health), in different treatment environments (inpatient vs outpatient), and half were conducted with and without suction. The use of suction was not randomized but was determined at the treating clinician's discretion. Patients treated in the inpatient environment lay on their beds, whereas patients in the outpatient environment sat in a treatment chair.
Results
There was higher microbial count during treatment (P < .001) with a higher microbial count associated with lower ultrasound amplitude (P = .028), lower saline flow rate (P = .010), no suction attachment (P = > .001), and a larger wound area (P = .002). All were independently associated with greater microorganism aerosolization. There was no correlation between the type of handpiece selected, the presence of wound infection, and the treatment time or treatment environment.
Conclusions
This research has assisted in developing guidelines for cleaning of equipment and environments following treatment, as well as around the use of personal protective equipment required to protect the staff member and the patient during the use of LFUD. Additionally, recommendations have been made regarding the specific LFUD settings to reduce the risk of cross-infection to the clinic environment. These include selecting a higher ultrasound amplitude and saline flow rate as well as the use of suction where clinically possible."

Perioperative hair removal using clippers requires lengthy cleanup to remove loose hairs contaminating the operative field. We compared the amount of hair debris and associated microbiologic contamination produced during clipping of surgical sites using standard surgical clippers (SSC) or clippers fitted with a vacuum-assisted hair collection device (SCVAD).
Methods
Trained nurses conducted bilateral hair clipping of the chest and groin of 18 male subjects using SSC or SCVAD. Before and during clipping, measurements of particulate matter and bacterial contamination were evaluated on settling plates placed next to each subject's chest and groin. Skin condition after clipping and total clipping/cleanup times were compared between SSC and SCVAD.
Results
The microbial burden recovered from residual hair during cleanup in the SSC group was 3.9 log10 CFU and 4.6 log10 CFU from respective, chest, and groin areas. Use of the SCVAD resulted in a significant (P < .001) reduction in both residual hair and microbial contamination within the operative field compared with SSC.
Conclusions
Use of SCVAD resulted in significant (P < .001) reduction in total time required to clip and clean up residual hair contaminating the operative field compared with standard practice (ie, SSC), eliminating the need to physically remove dispersed hairs, which can harbor a significant microbial burden, from within the operative field."

Data from the 2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and 2013 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) were used to determine national and state-specific Tdap vaccination coverage among women of childbearing age by self-reported pregnancy status at the time of the survey. Although this study could not assess coverage of Tdap vaccination received during pregnancy because questions on whether Tdap vaccination was received during pregnancy were not asked in BRFSS and NHIS, demographic and access-to-care factors associated with Tdap vaccination coverage in this population were assessed. Tdap vaccination coverage among all women 18-44 years old was 38.4% based on the BRFSS and 23.3% based on the NHIS. Overall, coverage did not differ by pregnancy status at the time of the survey. Coverage among all women 18-44 years old varied widely by state. Age, race and ethnicity, education, number of children in the household, and access-to-care characteristics were independently associated with Tdap vaccination in both surveys.

Major complications of central venous catheter (CVC) use include bloodstream infection and occlusion. We performed a prospective, observational study to determine the rate of central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and CVC occlusion using a negative displacement connector with an alcohol disinfecting cap.
Methods
Patients were followed from the time of CVC insertion through 2 days after removal, at the time of hospital discharge if there was no documentation of removal, or 90 days after the insertion of the CVC if it was not removed. CLABSI was defined using National Healthcare Safety Network criteria. Data for evidence of lumen occlusions were extracted from the electronic health record. Direct observations were performed to assess adherence to hospital policy regarding CVC insertion practice.
Results
A total of 2,512 catheters from 2,264 patients were enrolled for this study. There were 21 CLABSIs (0.84%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48%-1.19%; 0.62 per 1,000 line days) and 378 occlusions (15.05%; 95% CI, 13.65%-16.45%; 11.23 per 1,000 line days).

We surveyed providers' knowledge of guidelines, cognitive-behavioral constructs, and self-reported familiarity with the relevant Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. The survey was administered to providers in the preintervention (n = 169) and postintervention (n = 157) periods at the intervention site and postintervention (n = 65) at the comparison site.
Results
At the intervention site, the mean knowledge score increased significantly during the postintervention period (from 57.5%-69.9%; P < .0001) and fewer providers reported following incorrect cognitive cues (pyuria and organism type) for treatment of ASB. The knowledge of guidelines was higher in the postintervention sample after adjusting for provider type in the multiple linear regression analysis. Cognitive behavioral constructs (ie, self-efficacy, behavior, social norms, and risk perceptions) and self-reported familiarity with the guidelines also significantly improved during the postintervention period.
Conclusions
We identified and targeted specific barriers that drive overtreatment of ASB. Guideline implementation interventions targeting cognitive biases are essential for encouraging the application of ASB guidelines into practice."

The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of bacteremia on intensive care unit (ICU) mortality and to develop a bacteremia prediction tool using systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria.
Methods
Patients included those aged >18 years who had blood cultures taken in the ICU from January 1, 2011-December 31, 2013. Eligible patients were identified from microbiology records of the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Scotland. Clinical and outcome data were gathered from ICU records. Patients with clinically significant bacteremia were matched to controls using propensity scores. SIRS criteria were gathered and used to create decision rules to predict the absence of bacteremia. The main outcome was mortality at ICU discharge. The utility of the decision tools was measured using sensitivity and specificity.
Results
One hundred patients had a clinically significant positive blood culture and were matched to 100 controls. Patients with bacteremia had higher ICU mortality (odds ratio [OR], 2.35; P = .001) and longer ICU stay (OR, 17.0 vs 7.8 days; P ≤ .001). Of 1,548 blood culture episodes, 1,274 met ≥2 SIRS criteria (106 significant positive cultures and 1,168 negative cultures). There was no association between SIRS criteria and positive blood cultures (P = .11). A decision rule using 3 SIRS criteria had optimal predictive performance (sensitivity, 56%; specificity, 50%) but low accuracy.
Conclusions
ICU patients with bacteremia have increased mortality and length of ICU stay. SIRS criteria cannot be used to identify patients at low risk of bacteremia."

abstract = "Background
Environmental cleaning is a fundamental principle of infection prevention in hospitals, but its role in reducing transmission of health care-acquired pathogens has been difficult to prove experimentally. In this study we analyze the influence of cleaning previously uncleaned patient care items, grey zones (GZ), on health care-acquired transmission rates.
Methods
The intervention consisted of specific GZ cleaning by an extra cleaner (in addition to routine cleaning) on 2 structurally different acute care medical wards for a period of 6 months each, in a crossover design. Data on health care-acquired transmissions of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium difficile were collected during both periods. Adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) using Poisson regression were calculated to compare transmission of pathogens between both periods on both wards.
Results
During the intervention VRE transmission was significantly decreased (2-fold) on the ward where patients had fewer roommates; cleaning of GZ did not have any effect on the ward with multiple-occupancy rooms. There was no impact on methicillin-resistant S aureus transmission and only a nonsignificant decrease in transmission of C difficile.
Conclusions
Our data provide evidence that targeted cleaning interventions can reduce VRE transmission when rooming conditions are optimized; such interventions can be cost-effective when the burden of VRE is significant. Enhanced cleaning interventions are less beneficial in the context of room sharing where many other factors contribute to transmission of pathogens."

abstract = "Background
Understanding the dynamics of aerial spread of Acinetobacter may provide useful information for production of effective control measurements. We investigated genetic relationships between air and clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting.
Methods
We conducted a prospective surveillance study in a tertiary care hospital for 8 months. A total of 186 air samples were taken from 2 ICUs. Clonal characteristics of air isolates were compared with the prospective clinical strains and the previously isolated strains of ICU patients over a 23-month period.
Results
Twenty-six (11.4%) air samples yielded A baumannii, of which 24 (92.3%) isolates were carbapenem-resistant. The Acinetobacter concentration was the highest in bedside sampling areas of infected patients (0.39 CFU/m3). Air isolates were clustered in 13 genotypes, and 7 genotypes (including 18 air strains) were clonally related to the clinical strains of 9 ICU patients. One clone continued to be cultured over 27 days in ICU air, and air isolates could be clonally related to 7-week retrospective and approximately 15-week prospective clinical strains.
Conclusions
The results of this study suggest that infected patients could spread significant amounts of Acinetobacter to ICU air. These strains could survive in air for some weeks and could likely still infect new patients after some months. Special control measurements may be required against the airborne spread of Acinetobacter in ICUs."

The quantitative effect of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections on real-world health care resources is not clear. This study aimed to estimate the burden of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in pneumonia inpatients in Japan.
Methods
Using a nationwide administrative claims database, we analyzed pneumonia patients who had been hospitalized in 1,063 acute care hospitals. Patients who received anti-MRSA drugs were categorized into an anti-MRSA drug group, and the remaining patients comprised the control group. We estimated the burden of length of stay, in-hospital mortality, total antibiotic agent costs, and total hospitalization costs. Risk adjustments were conducted using propensity score matching.
Results
The study sample comprised 634 patients administered anti-MRSA drugs and 87,427 control patients. In propensity score-matching analysis (1 to 1), the median length of stay, antibiotic costs, and hospitalization costs of the anti-MRSA drug group were significantly higher than those of the control group (21 days vs 14 days [P < .001], $756 vs $172 [P < .001] and $8,741 vs $5,063 [P < .001], respectively); the attributable excess of these indicators were 9.0 ± 1.6 days, $1,044 ± $101, and $5,548 ± $580, respectively.
Conclusions
These findings may serve as a reference to support further research on multidrug-resistant bacterial infections and eventually inform policy formulation."

The fecal carriage of β-lactamase (BL)–producing bacteria may play a major role in the spread of these organisms in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). The aims of this study were (1) to describe the gene profiles of fecal BL in 3 LCTFs in Taiwan and (2) to analyze the fecal carriage burden of BL genes between the residents (patient group) and staff (staff group) of LTCFs.
Methods
Thirty fecal samples were collected during June 2013 and July 2015: 20 were obtained from 10 residents both during hospitalization (T1) and 1 month after discharge (T2), and 10 were obtained from 10 staff members.
Results
In total, 80%, 70%, and 50% of the samples in the patient group at T1, staff group at T2, and patient group at T2, respectively, contained >2 BL genes. In the patient group, the predominant genes belonged to extended-spectrum BL genes (90%-100%) and AmpC BL genes (90%-100%). Furthermore, carbapenemase genes were approximately 20% during T1 and T2. The relative levels of SHV-type BLs were significantly higher (P < .05) in the patient group at T2 compared with the staff group.
Conclusions
In this study, we found a high carriage of fecal BLs among LTCF residents and staff. The monitoring of fecal BL carriage in LTCFs is needed for infection control measures and antibiotic choice for health care–associated infections."

Legionnaires' disease (LD) is recognized as an important hospital-acquired disease. Despite the several methods available, the optimal method to control hospital-acquired LD is not well established and their overall efficacy requires further evaluation.
Objective
To systematically review all controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of interventions to prevent hospital-acquired LD in patients at high risk of developing the disease and its effects on environmental colonization.
Methods
A database search was performed through PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (inception-November 2014). Eligible studies included all controlled studies evaluating interventions to prevent hospital-acquired LD in patients at high risk or evaluating the effect on environmental colonization. Both individual and pooled risk estimates were reported using risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).
Results
There were no studies evaluating the risk reduction in hospital-acquired LD, but 4 studies evaluated the influence of copper-silver ionization and ultraviolet light in the reduction of environmental reservoirs of Legionella. The meta-analysis showed a significant 95% risk reduction of Legionella positivity in environmental samples using copper-silver ionization (RR, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.01-0.17) and 97% risk reduction with ultraviolet light (RR, 0.03; 95% CI, 0.002-0.41).
Conclusions
The best available evidence suggests that copper-silver ionization and ultraviolet light are effective in reducing Legionella positivity in environmental samples. Nevertheless, the low quality of evidence weakens the robustness of conclusions."

The influence of antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) on outcomes in male veterans treated for complicated urinary tract infection has not been determined.
Methods
This was a retrospective cohort study encompassing the study period January 1, 2005-October 31, 2014, which was conducted at a 150-bed Veterans Affairs Healthcare System facility in Buffalo, NY. Male veterans admitted for treatment of complicated urinary tract infection were identified using ICD-9-CM codes. Outcomes before and after implementation of a patient-centered ASP, including duration of antibiotic therapy, length of hospitalization, readmission within 30 days, and Clostridium difficile infection were compared. Interventions resulting from the ASP were categorized.
Results
Of the 1,268 patients screened, 241 met criteria for inclusion in the study (n = 118 and n = 123 in the pre-ASP and ASP group, respectively). Duration of antibiotic therapy was significantly shorter in the ASP group (10.32 days vs 11.96 days; P < .0001), as was length of hospitalization (5.76 days vs 6.76 days; P = .015). There was no difference in 30-day readmission. A total of 170 interventions were identified that resulted from the ASP (1.39 interventions per patient).
Conclusions
ASPs may be useful to improve clinical outcomes in men with complicated urinary tract infection. Implementation of an ASP was associated with significant decreases in duration of antibiotic therapy and length of hospitalization, without adversely affecting 30-day readmission rates."

Risk factors for leg wound infection were identified as age older than 75 years, being a woman, body mass index > 28, having diabetes, being a smoker, and diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease. Patients who had at least 2 of these risk factors were selected for a pilot use of EVH and were matched to patients undergoing OVH (n = 50 patients/group). Costs incurred included costs of dressings, additional hospital stay, and costs for attending our outpatient wound clinic (OWC), amongst others. For the EVH group, there was the additional cost of the kit (£650 per patient). Data were prospectively collected.
Results
There were no significant differences in the preoperative characteristics between the 2 groups. During in-hospital stay, 18% (9 out of 50) versus 32% (16 out of 50) (P = .08) of patients (EVH vs OVH, respectively) had minor leg-wound suppurations. Patients in the OVH group had longer hospital stay (P = .01). Attendance at the OWC for leg-wound issues was 4% (2 out of 50) versus 48% (24 out of 50), respectively (P < .01), costing a total of £2,758 for the EVH group compared with £78,036 for the OVH group (P < .01). This amounted to cost savings of £42,778 (including EVH kit costs) favoring EVH.
Conclusions
In patients at high-risk of leg wound complications, EVH was associated with significant cost-savings and less leg wound complications."

This review provides examples of airborne transmission of infectious agents from experimental and field studies and discusses how airborne pathogens can contaminate other parts of the environment to give rise to secondary vehicles leading air-surface-air nexus with possible transmission to susceptible hosts. The following groups of human pathogens are covered because of their known or potential airborne spread: vegetative bacteria (staphylococci and legionellae), fungi (Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Cladosporium spp and Stachybotrys chartarum), enteric viruses (noro- and rotaviruses), respiratory viruses (influenza and coronaviruses), mycobacteria (tuberculous and nontuberculous), and bacterial spore formers (Clostridium difficile and Bacillus anthracis). An overview of methods for experimentally generating and recovering airborne human pathogens is included, along with a discussion of factors that influence microbial survival in indoor air. Available guidelines from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and other global regulatory bodies for the study of airborne pathogens are critically reviewed with particular reference to microbial surrogates that are recommended. Recent developments in experimental facilities to contaminate indoor air with microbial aerosols are presented, along with emerging technologies to decontaminate indoor air under field-relevant conditions. Furthermore, the role that air decontamination may play in reducing the contamination of environmental surfaces and its combined impact on interrupting the risk of pathogen spread in both domestic and institutional settings is discussed."

Although indoor air can spread many pathogens, information on the airborne survival and inactivation of such pathogens remains sparse.
Methods
Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae were nebulized separately into an aerobiology chamber (24.0 m3). The chamber's relative humidity and air temperature were at 50% ± 5% and 20°C ± 2°C, respectively. The air was sampled with a slit-to-agar sampler. Between tests, filtered air purged the chamber of any residual airborne microbes.
Results
The challenge in the air varied between 4.2 log10 colony forming units (CFU)/m3 and 5.0 log10 CFU/m3, sufficient to show a ≥3 log10 (≥99.9%) reduction in microbial viability in air over a given contact time by the technologies tested. The rates of biologic decay of S aureus and K pneumoniae were 0.0064 ± 0.00015 and 0.0244 ± 0.009 log10 CFU/m3/min, respectively. Three commercial devices, with ultraviolet light and HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filtration, met the product efficacy criterion in 45-210 minutes; these rates were statistically significant compared with the corresponding rates of biologic decay of the bacteria. One device was also tested with repeated challenges with aerosolized S aureus to simulate ongoing fluctuations in indoor air quality; it could reduce each such recontamination to an undetectable level in approximately 40 minutes.
Conclusions
The setup described is suitable for work with all major classes of pathogens and also complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's guidelines (2012) for testing air decontamination technologies."

Clostridium difficile–associated disease (CDAD) is the most common infectious antibiotic-associated diarrhea and is a growing health care problem. Prevention of Clostridium difficile infection focuses on clinical and epidemiologic infection control measures.
Methods
Between 2008 and 2009, we conducted a retrospective study that showed an incidence of CDAD among the highest reported in the literature. Subsequently, we developed a preventive protocol that was adopted in our hospital in 2010. We then conducted a prospective study to investigate prevalence, incidence, and mortality of CDAD and to compare the results with those of the retrospective study, evaluating adherence to preventive measures and their efficacy.
Results
In both studies, prevalence and incidence significantly increased in older patients. Crude prevalence was similar in the 2 studies. The incidence rate increased by 36%, with a significant increase only in the C and D wards. In-hospital mortality rose in both prevalent and incident cases. Regarding adhesion to hospital protocol, 77% of prevalent cases were treated with the required procedure. The highest percentage of isolated patients was achieved in C and D wards. In these wards we detected lower training hours per nurse. However, in 2013, we observed a significant decrease in incidence of CDAD and found a hospital prevalence of 0.33%.
Conclusions
Health care personnel education could be more important than the possibility of isolating infected patients in single rooms."

Hospital-acquired infection, including catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), is common. Although CAUTI is usually preventable, hospital units may struggle to reduce CAUTI rates. The CAUTI guide to patient safety (GPS) was developed to assess a unit's CAUTI prevention activities. Our aim was to qualitatively validate the GPS.
Methods
We interviewed participants from 2 units in each of 4 hospitals. Each unit's nurse manager completed the GPS and then discussed their answers with a trained research assistant. Semistructured interviews were conducted with unit nurses and physicians. We compared the nurse managers' answers to the unit physicians' and nurses' responses and assessed agreement.
Results
A total of 49 participants from 4 medical intensive care units and 4 medical-surgical units were interviewed. Nurse managers found the GPS helpful and complete. There was higher agreement between nurse managers and unit nurses than with physicians. Some questions generated more disagreement than others. Our findings suggest that the GPS is comprehensive and may be best used to stimulate discussions between stakeholders to address key issues.
Conclusions
Using the GPS to assess several stakeholders' views could allow a given unit to move its CAUTI prevention efforts forward in a more informed manner."

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a leading cause of health care–associated infections, and the role that the hospital environment might play in the transmission cycle remains undefined. We determined the distribution of environmental MRSA isolates, studied contamination patterns of MRSA clones, and evaluated the association between MRSA patient load and environmental contamination.
Methods
High-contact surfaces were sampled for 12 consecutive months in 2 inpatient wards. Concurrently, aggregated data of MRSA patient infection burden were analyzed. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and molecular epidemiologic tools were used to characterize and analyze all isolates.
Results
Overall, 23.7% of the surfaces were MRSA positive. Handrails (58.3%), the medicine room (50.0%), chart holders (41.7%), and access doors (33.3%) were the most contaminated surfaces. Thirty-four different MRSA pulsotypes were identified. Forty-six percent of the isolates were SCCmecII/USA100. Recurrent introduction and reintroduction of clones and hot spot surfaces frequently contaminated with different MRSA strains were observed. However, long-term contamination (maintenance) was not observed. The burden of clinical MRSA cases was not an indicator of the level of environmental contamination.
Conclusions
MRSA frequently contaminates hospital surfaces during nonoutbreak periods and is not associated with the number of clinical MRSA cases. Monitoring and thorough cleaning and disinfection of hot spot surfaces are necessary to minimize the presence of MRSA in the hospital."

The economic burden associated nosocomial infections (NIs) in patients with acute leukemia (AL) in China was unclear. A prospective study was conducted to quantify the medical cost burden of NIs among AL patients.
Methods
Nine hundred ninety-four patients diagnosed with AL between January 2011 and December 2013 were included. Relevant necessary information was extracted from the hospital information system and hospital infection surveillance system. The primary outcome was incidence of NIs and the secondary was economic burden results, including extra medical costs and prolonged length of stay (LOS). We estimated the total incremental cost of NIs by comparing all-cause health care costs in patients with versus without infections. Prolonged duration of stay was compared in patients with different infections.
Results
Of 994 patients with AL, 277 (27.9%) experienced NIs. NI was associated with a total incremental cost of $3,092 per patient ($5,227 vs $2,135; P < .01) and infected patients experienced a longer LOS (21 vs 10 days; P < .01). Patients with multisite infection had the highest total medical cost ($8,474.90 vs $2,209.90; P < .01) and the longest LOS (25 vs 15 days; P < .01). Western medicine was the main contributor to the rise of total cost in all kinds of infections.
Conclusions
NI was associated with higher medical costs, which imposed an economic burden on patients with AL. The study highlights the influence of NIs on LOS and health care costs and appeal to the establishment of prophylactic measures for NIs to reduce the unnecessary waste of medical resources in the long run."

Universal decolonization is recommended in intensive care units (ICUs) that have unacceptably high rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) despite implementation of basic prevention strategies.
Methods
An interrupted time series study was performed to evaluate the effect of daily chlorhexidine bathing on the acquisition of MRSA in a medical ICU with MRSA endemicity. There was a 14-month control period and a 16-month chlorhexidine bathing period. Segmented Poisson regression analysis was performed to assess the impact of daily chlorhexidine bathing on the incidence density of MRSA. Also, chlorhexidine susceptibility testing with polymerase chain reaction for the qacA/B gene was performed on MRSA isolates collected during the chlorhexidine bathing period.
Results
There was a significant reduction in trend (−0.056; 95% confidence interval, −0.095 to −0.017; P = .005) of incidence density of MRSA despite a significant increase in both level and trend of MRSA prevalence rates during the chlorhexidine bathing period. However, there was no significant reduction in level of incidence density of MRSA during the interventional period. Minimum inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine and the detection rates of the qacA/B gene for a total of 174 MRSA isolates did not increase during the chlorhexidine bathing period.
Conclusions
Daily chlorhexidine bathing resulted in a significantly decreasing trend of MRSA acquisition rates irrespective of increased MRSA prevalence rates in the medical ICU. There was no shift of chlorhexidine-resistant MRSA strains."

The nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are widely spread. In Brazil, 2,520 cases of rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) infections after medical procedures were reported, with 5.4% of cases related to nonsurgical invasive procedures and with an occurrence of 1 clone (BRA100) of Mycobacterium abscessus subsp bolletii.
Objective
To describe a pseudooutbreak of M abscessus subsp bolletii in an endoscopy and bronchoscopy unit.
Methods
The alert for a pseudooutbreak was given when 3 patients, in the same week, had a positive bronchoalveolar lavage culture for M abscessus subsp bolletii. The patients had no symptoms/signs of mycobacterial infection; thus, contamination of bronchoscopes was suspected. Samples for culturing were collected from bronchoscopes, digestive endoscopes, automated disinfection machines, and the water supply. Clinical samples were identified by polymerase chain reaction restriction-enzyme analysis (PRA) of the hsp65 gene and their pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern was compared with environmental samples.
Results
The investigation demonstrated a contamination of bronchoscopes, digestive endoscopes, and disinfection machines. Molecular typing demonstrated that all strains belonged to the same clone (MAB01), identical to clone BRA100.
Discussion
Cross-transmission due to poor disinfection as well as resistance to glutaraldehyde may play roles in the spread of MAB01 M abscessus subsp bolletii, which may have a unique resistance to the environment and adaption to human hosts. However the water supply may have played a role. Attention is needed to ensure the quality of water used to rinse disinfected equipment."

Methods
This retrospective case-control study characterized risk factors for active MRSA infection among patients colonized with MRSA at hospital admission. Potential demographic and clinical risk factors were identified using electronic queries and manual chart abstraction; data were compared by standard statistical tests, and variables with P ≤ .05 in bivariable analysis were entered into a multivariable logistic regression model.
Results
There were 71 cases and 213 controls. Risk factors associated with MRSA infection included diabetes mellitus with or without end organ damage (26% vs 14%, P = .02), hemiplegia (9% vs 2%, P = .01), chronic kidney disease (33% vs 20%, P = .03), postcolonization inpatient admission within 90 days (44% vs 29%, P = .03), surgery (41% vs 9%, P < .01), and dialysis (10% vs 3%, P = .02). On multivariable analysis, surgery during follow-up, dialysis during follow-up, and hemiplegia remained significant.
Conclusions
Among patients with MRSA colonization, surgery or dialysis during follow-up and history of hemiplegia were associated with subsequent MRSA infection. Knowledge of these risk factors may allow for future targeted interventions to prevent MRSA infections among colonized patients."

The patients were admitted in pediatric and neonatal intensive care units (41.8% and 9.7%, respectively) and in pediatric wards (48.5%). Candida albicans was the most prevalent species (47%), followed by Candida parapsilosis (13.4%), Candida tropicalis (8.2%), Candida glabrata (4.5%), Candida lusitaniae (3.7%), Candida kefyr (2.2%), Candida guilliermondii (1.5%), Candida dubliniensis (0.7%), and Candida krusei (0.7%). Types of Candida infections were candidemia (50.7%), urinary tract infection (33.6%), surgical site infection (4.5%), central nervous system infection (3.7%), catheter infection (3.7%), and intra-abdominal infection (3.7%). In multivariate analysis, younger age (1-24 months) and detection of non-albicans Candida spp was found to be risk factors associated with candidemia (P = 0.040; odds ratio [OR], 4.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-15.86; and P = 0.02; OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.10-5.53, respectively).
Conclusions
This study provides an update for the epidemiology of nosocomial Candida infections in Istanbul, which is important for the management of patients and implementation of appropriate infection control measures."

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends annual flu vaccination for all adults. We aimed to identify predictors of receiving a flu vaccination, with an emphasis on the impact of race and ethnicity.
Methods
We used data from the 2011-2012 California Health Interview Survey and included all individuals aged ≥18 years. We performed a survey-weighted logistic regression on receipt of flu vaccination within the last year, adjusted by demographic and socioeconomic variables, and calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Results
Our study included a population-weighted sample of 27,796,484 individuals. Overall, 35.8% received a flu vaccination within the last year. Blacks were 33% less likely (95% CI, 21%-43%) to have been vaccinated than whites. Conversely, Koreans (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.35-2.33) and Vietnamese (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.19-2.07) were more likely than whites to have been vaccinated. No differences were seen between whites and the remaining racial and ethnic groups (Latino, Japanese, Chinese, Filipino, South Asian, Asian other, and other).
Conclusions
Racial and ethnic disparities in flu vaccination uptake exist in California. Namely, blacks have lower vaccination rates than whites, and there are disparate vaccination rates among the Asian-American subgroups. Efforts to increase vaccination rates among these groups are needed."

abstract = "Background
During a study designed to assess endoscope reprocessing effectiveness, a borescope was used to examine lumens and ports. Cloudy, white, viscous fluid was observed inside fully reprocessed gastroscopes and colonoscopes. This fluid resembled simethicone, which is commonly administered to reduce foam and bubbles that impede visualization during gastrointestinal endoscopy. This article describes methods used to determine whether the observed fluid contained simethicone.
Methods
Photographs of residual fluid were taken using a borescope. Sterile cotton-tipped swabs were used to collect samples of fluid observed in 3 endoscope ports. Samples were evaluated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)–attenuated total reflection analysis.
Results
Residual fluid was observed inside 19 of 20 endoscopes. Fluid photographed in 8 endoscopes resembled simethicone solutions. FTIR analysis confirmed the presence of simethicone in 2 endoscopes.
Conclusions
Fluid containing simethicone remained inside endoscopes despite reprocessing. Simethicone is an inert, hydrophobic substance that may reduce reprocessing effectiveness. Simethicone solutions commonly contain sugars and thickeners, which may contribute to microbial growth and biofilm development. Studies are needed to assess the prevalence of residual moisture and simethicone in endoscopes and determine the impact on reprocessing effectiveness. We recommend minimizing the use of simethicone pending further research into its safety."

Complications of intravenous catheters remain a major contributor to health care costs and are a patient safety problem. An intravenous catheter not actively in use—an idle catheter—may increase the risk of infectious and noninfectious complications. We conducted an integrative review of the available literature to evaluate the prevalence, risk factors, and outcomes associated with idle intravenous catheters.
Methods
Searches of multiple computerized databases were conducted to identify studies on idle intravenous catheters. Data on definitions of idle catheter, type of catheter, prevalence, risk factors, and patient outcomes were extracted.
Results
Thirteen studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The location and setting of the studies were diverse, including cross-sectional, retrospective, and prospective, and were conducted in varied geographic locations. The definition of an idle catheter was variable across studies. Although studies varied in terms of line-days or number of catheters placed, the primary definition of idle device was based on number of days or percent of devices left in situ without use. Four studies evaluated patient outcomes associated with idle catheters and found increased risk of infection, intensive care unit admission, and phlebitis.
Conclusions
Idle intravenous catheters are common and are associated with adverse outcomes. Prospective studies incorporating uniform definitions of idle catheters to test interventions to reduce idle catheter use are urgently needed."

abstract = "Background
Health care–associated infections (HAIs) are a major global public health concern. The lack of surveillance systems in developing countries leads to an underestimation of the global burden of HAI. We describe the process of developing a national HAI surveillance program and the magnitude of HAI rates in Egypt.
Methods
The detailed process of implementation of a national HAI surveillance program is described. A 3-phase surveillance approach was implemented in intensive care units (ICUs). This article focuses on results from the phase 2 surveillance. Standard surveillance definitions were used, clinical samples were processed by the hospital laboratories, and results were confirmed by a reference laboratory.
Results
Ninety-one ICUs in 28 hospitals contributed to 474,544 patient days and 2,688 HAIs. Of these, 30% were bloodstream infections, 29% were surgical site infections, 26% were pneumonia, and 15% were urinary tract infections. Ventilator-associated pneumonia had the highest incidence of device-associated infections (4.3/1,000 ventilator days). The most common pathogens reported were Klebsiella spp (28.7%) and Acinetobacter spp (13.7%). Of the Acinetobacter spp, 92.8% (157/169) were multidrug resistant, whereas 42.5% (151/355) of the Klebsiella spp and 54% (47/87) of Escherichia coli were extended-spectrum β-lactamase producers.
Conclusions
Implementation of a sustainable surveillance system in a resource-limited country was possible following a stepwise approach with continuous evaluation. Enhancing infection prevention and control programs should be an infection control priority in Egypt."

Antibiotic resistance is a challenge in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). The objective of this study was to demonstrate that a novel, minimally invasive program not interfering with activities of daily living or socialization could lower methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) disease.
Methods
This was a prospective, cluster-randomized, nonblinded trial initiated at 3 LTCFs. During year 1, units were stratified by type of care and randomized to intervention or control. In year 2, all units were converted to intervention consisting of universal decolonization using intranasal mupirocin and a chlorhexidine bath performed twice (2 decolonization-bathing cycles 1 month apart) at the start of the intervention period. Subsequently, after initial decolonization, all admissions were screened on site using real-time polymerase chain reaction, and those MRSA positive were decolonized, but not isolated. Units received annual instruction on hand hygiene. Enhanced bleach wipe cleaning of flat surfaces was done every 4 months.
Results
There were 16,773 tests performed. The MRSA infection rate decreased 65% between baseline (44 infections during 365,809 patient days) and year 2 (12 infections during 287,847 patient days; P < .001); a significant reduction was observed at each of the LTCFs (P < .03).
Conclusions
On-site MRSA surveillance with targeted decolonization resulted in a significant decrease in clinical MRSA infection among LTCF residents."

An increase in respiratory syncytial virus type B (RSV-B) infections was detected on an adult hematology/oncology and stem cell transplant unit during March 2015. This prompted an outbreak investigation.
Methods
Nosocomial cases were defined as RSV-B–positive patients who developed respiratory virus symptoms ≥ 7 days after admission to the unit or were readmitted with symptoms ≤ 7 days since last discharge from the unit. Strict outbreak control measures were implemented to stop the outbreak.
Results
During the outbreak, 19 cases of RSV-B were detected, 14 among patients and 5 among health care workers (HCWs). Additionally, 2 HCWs tested positive for respiratory syncytial virus type A and 1 tested positive for influenza B among the 27 symptomatic HCWs evaluated. No specific antiviral therapy was given and all cases recovered without progression to lower respiratory tract infection. After no new cases were identified for 2 weeks, the outbreak was declared over.
Conclusions
High vigilance for respiratory viruses on high-risk inpatient units is required for detection and prevention of potential outbreaks. Multiple respiratory viruses with outbreak potential were identified among HCWs. HCWs with respiratory virus symptoms should not provide direct patient care. Absence of lower respiratory tract infection suggests lower virulence of RSV-B, compared with respiratory syncytial virus type A, among immunocompromised adults."

Studies in adult long-term care facilities (LTCFs) have shown a correlation between hand hygiene (HH) and viral outbreak reduction, but no such studies have been conducted in pediatric LTCFs where the epidemiology of viral pathogens is different.
Methods
We compared electronically monitored facility-wide HH frequency in the weeks immediately prior to outbreaks of acute respiratory or gastrointestinal infections versus control weeks in a 137-bed pediatric LTCF from October 2012-August 2015. Control weeks were the 8-14 day (control 1) and 15-21 day (control 2) periods prior to the onset of each outbreak.
Results
There was no difference in HH frequency in the weeks leading up to the outbreaks versus control weeks (odds ratio [OR], 1.0; 95% confidence interval CI, 1.00-1.001 using control 1 and OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 1.00-1.001 using control 2).
Conclusions
Our findings differed from those in adult LTFCs, possibly because of the greater contact between residents and staff in the pediatric setting, increased susceptibility to viral pathogens because of immunologic immaturity, or differences in the types of pathogens prevalent in each setting. Although HH may be important for limiting the number of residents infected during outbreaks, we found no association between HH frequency and subsequent outbreak onset."

The present study aimed to assess the efficacy of computer-based endoscope cleaning and disinfection using a hospital management information system (HMIS).
Methods
A total of 2,674 gastroscopes were eligible for inclusion in this study. For the processes of disinfection management, the gastroscopes were randomly divided into 2 groups: gastroscope disinfection HMIS (GD-HMIS) group and manual group. In the GD-HMIS group, an integrated circuit card (IC card) chip was installed to monitor and record endoscope cleaning and disinfection automatically and in real time, whereas the endoscope cleaning and disinfection in the manual group was recorded manually. The overall disinfection progresses for both groups were recorded, and the total operational time was calculated.
Results
For the GD-HMIS group, endoscope disinfection HMIS software was successfully developed. The time to complete a single session of cleaning and disinfecting on a gastroscope was 15.6 minutes (range, 14.3-17.2 minutes) for the GD-HMIS group and 21.3 minutes (range, 20.2-23.9 minutes) for the manual group. Failure to record information, such as the identification number of the endoscope, occasionally occurred in the manual group, which affected the accuracy and reliability of manual recording.
Conclusions
Computer-based gastroscope cleaning and disinfection using a hospital management information system could monitor the process of gastroscope cleaning and disinfection in real time and improve the accuracy and reliability, thereby ensuring the quality of gastroscope cleaning and disinfection."

We systematically reviewed existing research pertinent to Ebola virus disease and social media, especially to identify the research questions and the methods used to collect and analyze social media.
Methods
We searched 6 databases for research articles pertinent to Ebola virus disease and social media. We extracted the data using a standardized form. We evaluated the quality of the included articles.
Results
Twelve articles were included in the main analysis: 7 from Twitter with 1 also including Weibo, 1 from Facebook, 3 from YouTube, and 1 from Instagram and Flickr. All the studies were cross-sectional. Eleven of the 12 articles studied ≥ 1of these 3 elements of social media and their relationships: themes or topics of social media contents, meta-data of social media posts (such as frequency of original posts and reposts, and impressions) and characteristics of the social media accounts that made these posts (such as whether they are individuals or institutions). One article studied how news videos influenced Twitter traffic. Twitter content analysis methods included text mining (n = 3) and manual coding (n = 1). Two studies involved mathematical modeling. All 3 YouTube studies and the Instagram/Flickr study used manual coding of videos and images, respectively.
Conclusions
Published Ebola virus disease-related social media research focused on Twitter and YouTube. The utility of social media research to public health practitioners is warranted."

There are only few reports describing the influence of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) prevention strategies on the incidence of bacterial bloodstream infections (BBSIs).
Methods
We performed a retrospective cohort study among pediatric recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) to assess potential changes in BBSI rates during 3 time periods: pre-CLABSI prevention era (era 1, 2004-2005), CLABSI prevention implementation era (era 2, 2006-2009), and maintenance of CLABSI prevention era (era 3, 2010-2012). BBSI from day 0-365 following allo-HCT were studied. The comparison of person-years incidence rates among different periods was carried out by Poisson regression analysis.
Results
The mean age of patients was 10.0 years. During the study period, 126 (65%) of 190 patients had at least a single BBSI. From day 0-30, day 31-100, day 101-180, and day 181-365, 20%, 28%, 30%, and 17% of patients, respectively, experienced BBSIs. The rate of Staphylococcus epidermidis and gram-negative pathogens significantly declined from 3.16-0.93 and 6.32-2.21 per 100 person-months during era 1 and era 3, respectively (P = .001).
Conclusions
Patients undergoing allo-HCT during era 3 were associated with decreased risk of BBSI (P = .012). Maintenance of CLABSI protocols by nursing staff and appropriate education of other care providers is essential to lower incidence of BBSI in this high-risk population, and further strategies to decrease infection burden should be studied."

Cleaning of surfaces is essential in reducing environmental bioburdens and health care-associated infection in emergency units. However, there are few or no studies investigating cleaning surfaces in these scenarios. Our goal was to determine the influence of a multifaceted intervention on the effectiveness of routine cleaning of surfaces in a walk-in emergency care unit.
Methods
This prospective, before-and-after interventional study was conducted in 4 phases: phase I (situational diagnosis), phase II (implementation of interventions—feedback on results, standardization of cleaning procedures, and training of nursing staff), phase III (determination of the immediate influence of interventions), and phase IV (determination of the late influence of interventions). The surfaces were sampled before and after cleaning by visual inspection, adenosine triphosphate bioluminescence assay, and microbiologic culture.
Results
We sampled 240 surfaces from 4 rooms. When evaluated by visual inspection and adenosine triphosphate bioluminescence, there was a progressive reduction of surfaces found to be inadequate in phases I-IV (P < .001), as well as in culture phases I-III. However, phase IV showed higher percentages of failure by culture than phase I (P = .004).
Conclusions
The interventions improved the effectiveness of cleaning. However, this effect was not maintained after 2 months."

Few studies have evaluated terminal cleaning in low-resource settings.
Methods
Adequacy of pediatric isolation room terminal cleaning was evaluated using quantitative bacterial surface cultures, ATP bioluminescence assays, and fluorescent high-touch surface markers at Tygerberg Children's Hospital in South Africa (August 1, 2014-October 31, 2015). Cleaning adequacy was assessed by comparing pre- and postcleaning measurements. Influence of verbal feedback was determined by comparing cleaners' first and subsequent cleaning episodes. Cleaning methods were compared for cost, time, and feasibility.
Results
Adequacy of terminal cleaning was evaluated in 25 isolation rooms after hospitalization for pulmonary tuberculosis (n = 13), respiratory (n = 5) and enteric viruses (n = 5), pertussis (n = 1), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1). Mean aerobic colony counts and mean ATP relative light units declined between pre- and postcleaning evaluations (39 ± 41 to 15 ± 30 [P < .001] and 72 ± 40 to 23 ± 11 [P < .001]). Fluorescent marker removal was initially poor, but improved significantly at subsequent cleaning episodes (17 out of 78 [22%] to 121 out of 198 [61%]; P < .001); mean aerobic colony counts and ATP values also declined significantly following feedback. Cost, time, and resources required for ATP and surface cultures far exceeded that required for fluorescent markers.
Conclusions
Adequacy of isolation room cleaning improved following feedback to cleaning staff. Fluorescent markers are an inexpensive option for cleaning evaluation and training in low-resource settings."

abstract = "Background
The combination of inherent antimicrobial resistance and high mortality after bloodstream infections (BSIs) caused by chromosomally mediated AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CAE) emphasizes the importance of identifying patients at risk of BSI because of these bacteria. This retrospective case-control study examines chronic hemodialysis among other risk factors for BSI caused by CAE.
Methods
Hospitalized adults with Enterobacteriaceae BSI from January 1, 2010-June 30, 2014, at 2 large community hospitals in the Southeastern United States were identified. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine risk factors for CAE BSI.
Results
Among 831 Enterobacteriaceae bloodstream isolates, 106 (13%) met the phenotypic definition of CAE. Enterobacter spp accounted for 47% (50/106) of CAE BSIs. Chronic hemodialysis was an independent risk factor for CAE BSI (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-4.44). Other predictors of CAE BSI included nosocomial acquisition (aOR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.02-2.87) and exposure to β-lactam antibiotics within the last 30 days (aOR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.37-4.14).
Conclusions
To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate an increased risk of CAE BSI in patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing chronic hemodialysis. This highlights the importance of effective infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship interventions in hemodialysis clinics. Further studies to examine the impact of antibiotics on intestinal microbiota and rates of CAE colonization in this patient population are warranted."

Health care workers are at risk of occupational infections, and some procedures are known to increase this risk. The aim of this study was to qualify and quantify bioaerosol concentrations during bronchoscopy to estimate the occupational risk.
Methods
Full-day sampling was conducted in 2 rooms while bronchoscopies were performed on patients. Two microbial air samplers were used, a wet wall cyclonic sampler and an impactor, on culture media. Identification of the culturable bacterial flora was performed with chromatographic analysis of cellular fatty acid of the isolated strain and additional biochemical tests if needed. Specific polymerase chain reaction analysis was completed on wet wall cyclonic samples for the detection of influenza A and B and Mycobacterium spp.
Results
A wide variety of bacteria were collected from the ambient air. All samples yielded at least 1 Staphylococcus species. Although most of the culturable bacteria identified were normal nonpathogenic flora, such as Streptococcus spp, Neisseria spp, and Corynebacterium spp, some opportunistic pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, were found. Neither Mycobacterium spp nor influenza virus was detected with the polymerase chain reaction method during this study.
Conclusions
Culturable bacteria from oral, nasal, and pulmonary flora are aerosolized during bronchoscopy and could be inhaled by medical staff. The potential presence of pathogens in those aerosols could represent an occupational infection risk."

Candidemia is the third leading cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm or very-low-birth-weight infants. The incidence and risk factors of candidemia in this population are poorly known in western China.
Methods
A case-control retrospective study of candidemia was conducted from January 2012-November 2015 in the Liuzhou Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital. Data were analyzed by univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression.
Results
Forty-eight confirmed cases of candidemia were identified during the study period, indicating an incidence of 106.9 per 1,000 admissions of very-low-birth-weight infants. Candida albicans was the most common pathogen and was isolated in 39.6% of infants with candidemia. The mortality rate of the case group was 10.4% versus 2.1% in the control group (P = .128). The multivariable logistic regression model identified that carbapenem use (odds ratio [OR], 11.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.28-39.54), total parenteral nutrition (OR, 10.16; 95% CI, 2.25-45.94), and prolonged hospitalization (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07) were all associated with the risk of developing neonatal candidemia.
Conclusion
Very-low-birth-weight infants are at a significantly high risk of developing candidemia. The local neonatal intensive care unit management teams should effectively focus on decreasing the overall use of carbapenems, improving catheter care, removing catheters early, and shortening hospitalizations to reduce the incidence of candidemia."

Methods
Using an analytic, longitudinal, controlled, and comparative experimental trial, with blinded measurements, we recruited healthy, adult volunteers from the University of Guanajuato who completed a stabilization phase of skin microbiota and had no history of skin allergies. Four 25-cm2 areas of the inner surface of the forearms were designated for study: unscrubbed control for establishing baseline bacterial counts, scrubbed control with tridistilled water, scrubbed with chlorhexidine, and scrubbed with triclosan. Quantitative cultures were taken of all the areas at 0, 3, and 24 hours, using agar plates with neutralizing agents.
Results
A total of 135 healthy volunteers were tested. At 24 hours, the unscrubbed control counts were 288 CFU/cm2, whereas the scrubbed control counts were 96 CFU/cm2; 24 CFU/cm2 for chlorhexidine and 96 CFU/cm2 for triclosan (Kruskal-Wallis χ2 H = 64.27; P < .001).

Chlorhexidine-silver sulfadiazine (CHSS)-impregnated catheters have been found to decrease the risk of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) and central venous catheter (CVC)-related costs. However, there are no published data about cost-effectiveness of the use of CHSS-impregnated catheters in subclavian venous access without the presence of tracheostomy (thus, with a very low risk of CRBSI). That was the objective of this study.
Methods
This was a retrospective study of patients admitted to a mixed intensive care unit who underwent placement of subclavian venous catheters without the presence of tracheostomy.
Results
Patients with standard catheters (n = 747) showed a higher CRBSI incidence density (0.95 vs 0/1,000 catheter-days; P = .02) and higher CVC-related cost per day ($3.78 ± $7.43 vs $3.31 ± $2.72; P < .001) than patients with a CHSS-impregnated catheter (n = 879). Exact logistic regression analysis showed that catheter duration (P = .02) and the type of catheter used (P = .01) were associated with the risk of CRBSI. Kaplan-Meier method showed that CHSS-impregnated catheters were associated with more prolonged CRBSI-free time than standard catheters (log-rank = 9.76; P = .002). Poisson regression analysis showed that CHSS-impregnated catheters were associated with a lower central venous catheter-related cost per day than standard catheters (odds ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.001-0.903; P < .001).
Conclusions
The use of CHSS-impregnated catheters is an effective and efficient measure for the prevention of CRBSI even at subclavian venous access sites without the presence of tracheostomy."

Over 90% of annual deaths caused by Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) occur in persons aged ≥65 years. However, no large-scale studies have been conducted to investigate predictors of CDI-related mortality among older adults.
Methods
This case-control study included 540 CDI patients aged ≥60 years admitted to a tertiary care hospital in Detroit, Michigan, between January 2005 and December 2012. Cases were CDI patients who died within 30 days of CDI date. Controls were CDI patients who survived >30 days after CDI date. Cases were matched to controls on a 1:3 ratio based on age and hospital acquisition of CDI.
Results
One-hundred and thirty cases (25%) were compared with 405 controls (75%). Independent predictors of CDI-related mortality included admission from another acute hospital (odds ratio [OR], 8.25; P = .001) or a long-term care facility (OR, 13.12; P = .012), McCabe score ≥2 (OR, 12.19; P < .001), and high serum creatinine (≥1.7 mg/dL) (OR, 3.43; P = .021). The regression model was adjusted for the confounding effect of limited activity of daily living score, total number of antibiotic days prior to CDI, ileus on abdominal radiograph, low albumin (≤2.5 g/dL), elevated white blood cell count (>15 × 1,000/mm3), and admission to intensive care unit because of CDI.
Conclusions
Predictors of CDI-related mortality reported in this study could be applied to the development of a bedside scoring system for older adults with CDI."

We examined 9 different medical examination gloves from various manufacturers made of nitrile (n = 4), latex (n = 3), or neoprene (n = 2). Additionally, 1 latex surgical glove each with and without antibacterial chlorhexidine gluconate coating and 1 synthetic surgical glove made of thermoplastic elastomer were included in the experiments. The studied materials were perforated following a standardized procedure, and direct bacterial passage was measured under dynamic conditions. Glove elasticity at 1 cm up to 2.5 cm elongation was measured following EN 455-2.
Results
Nitrile gloves demonstrated higher material stiffness compared with latex gloves. Medical examination gloves made of nitrile and neoprene showed a 10-fold higher bacterial passage through a standardized puncture compared with latex gloves. All surgical gloves showed a lower bacterial passage compared with the tested examination gloves.
Conclusion
Bacterial passage through punctures is correlated with the stiffness or elasticity of the glove material. Therefore, gloves made of latex may have an increased protective effect in case of a glove breach. Whenever gloves are purchased and selected, a risk-benefit assessment should be conducted, balancing the risk of allergy against the degree of required protection in case of a glove puncture."

Ultraviolet (UV) spectrum light for decontamination of patient care areas is an effective way to reduce transmission of infectious pathogens. Our purpose was to investigate the efficacy of an automated UV-C device to eliminate bioburden on hospital computer keyboards.
Methods
The study took place at an academic hospital in Chicago, Illinois. Baseline cultures were obtained from keyboards in intensive care units. Automated UV-C lamps were installed over keyboards and mice of those computers. The lamps were tested at varying cycle lengths to determine shortest effective cycles. Delay after use and prior to cycle initiation was varied to minimize cycle interruptions. Finally, 218 postinstallation samples were analyzed.
Results
Of 203 baseline samples, 193 (95.1%) were positive for bacteria, with a median of 120 colony forming units (CFU) per keyboard. There were numerous bacteria linked to health care–associated infections (HAIs), including Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, Pasteurella, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, and Enterobacter. Of the 193 keyboards, 25 (12.3%) had gram-negative species. Of 218 postinstallation samples, 205 (94%) were sterile. Of the 13 that showed bacterial growth, 6 produced a single CFU. Comparison of pre- and post-UV decontamination median CFU values (120 and 0, respectively) revealed a >99% reduction in bacteria.
Conclusions
The UV lamp effectively decontaminates keyboards with minimal interruption and low UV exposure. Further studies are required to determine reduction of HAI transmission with use of these devices."

The modern built environment (BE) design creates unique ecological niches ideal for the survival and mutual interaction of microbial communities. This investigation focused on the synergistic relations between Legionella and the fungal species commonly found in BEs and the impact of these synergistic relationships on the survival and transmission of Legionella.
Methods
A field study was conducted to identify the types and concentrations of fungi in BEs. The fungal isolates purified from BEs were cocultured with Legionella to study their synergistic association. Cocultured Legionella cells were aerosolized in an air-tight chamber to evaluate the efficacy of ultraviolet (UV) to inactivate these cells.
Results
Aspergillus, Alternaria, and Cladosporium were the most common fungi detected in samples that tested positive for Legionella. After coculturing, Legionella cells were detected inside fungal hyphae. The microscopic observations of Legionella internalization in fungal hyphae were confirmed by molecular analyses. UV disinfection of the aerosolized Legionella cells that were cocultured with fungi indicated that fungal spores and propagules act as a shield against UV radiation. The shield effect of fungal spores on Legionella cells was quantified at >2.5 log10.
Conclusions
This study provides the first evidence, to our knowledge, of Legionella cell presence inside fungi detected in an indoor environment. This symbiotic relationship with fungi results in longer survival of Legionella under ambient conditions and provides protection against UV rays."

Point prevalence surveys (PPSs) in Japanese hospitals have not yet been reported. The purpose of this pilot PPS study was to evaluate the epidemiology of health care–associated infections (HAIs) and antimicrobial use in a Japanese tertiary university hospital.
Methods
A 1-day, cross-sectional PPS was performed at a Japanese university hospital. Data on demographics, active HAIs, and antimicrobial use of all inpatients were collected using a data collection form.
Results
Of 841 patients, 85 (10.1%) had 90 active HAIs, and 308 patients (36.6%) were administered 494 antimicrobials. Among the 90 HAIs and 58 pathogens, the most frequent infection and isolated pathogen were pneumonia (20.0%) and Enterobacteriaceae (27.6%), respectively. Of the 118 antimicrobials used for treatment of HAIs, carbapenems were the most frequently administered category of antimicrobials (22.9%). In regard to antimicrobials for surgical prophylaxis, 37 of 119 (31.1%) were administered to patients on postoperative day 3 or later, and 48 of 119 (40.3%) were administered orally.
Conclusions
The incidence of HAIs is higher than in other developed countries. The social and medical situation in Japan may affect patient demographics, active HAIs, and antimicrobial use. Multicenter PPSs are necessary to uncover the real epidemiology of HAIs and antimicrobial use in Japan."

The purpose of this study was to assess effectiveness of an interactive educational program in increasing knowledge of key infection prevention and control (IPC) principles with emphasis on indwelling device care, hand hygiene, and multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) among nursing home (NH) health care personnel (HCP).
Methods
We conducted a multimodal randomized controlled study involving HCP at 12 NHs. Ten comprehensive and interactive modules covered common IPC topics. We compared intervention and control scores to assess differences in pretest scores as a result of field interventions, pre- and post-test scores to assess knowledge gain, and magnitude of knowledge gain based on job categories.
Results
We conducted over 200 in-services across 10 topics at six intervention sites over 36 months. There were 4,962 tests returned over the course of the study, ranging from 389-633 per module. Participants were mostly female certified nursing assistants (CNAs). Score improvement was highest for modules emphasizing hand hygiene, urinary catheter care, and MDROs (15.6%, 15.9%, and 22.0%, respectively). After adjusting for cluster study design, knowledge scores were significantly higher after each educational module, suggesting the education delivery method was effective. When compared with CNAs, nursing and rehabilitation personnel scored significantly higher in their knowledge tests.
Conclusions
Our intervention significantly improved IPC knowledge in HCP, especially for those involved in direct patient care. This increase in knowledge along with preemptive barrier precautions and active surveillance has enhanced resident safety by reducing MDROs and infections in high-risk NH residents."

The ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) care bundle consists of evidence-based practices to improve the outcomes of patients receiving mechanical ventilatory therapy. This study aimed to investigate the implementation of the care bundle on VAP rates in this quasiexperimental study.
Methods
The protocol of this study consisted of 3 phases. In the initial phase, observations were made to determine the VAP care bundle adherence of intensive care unit (ICU) nurses. In the second phase, education was provided to ICU nurses on the subject of the VAP care bundle. For the third phase, the effect of VAP care bundle adherence on the VAP rates after education was investigated.
Results
The nurses' VAP care bundle adherence improved after education from 10.8% (n = 152) to 89.8% (n = 1,324) and showed statistically significant improvement (P = .0001 and P < .05). In this study, the VAP rates were determined as 15.91/103 ventilator-days before education and 8.50/103 ventilator days after education. It was found that the VAP rates after the education period were significantly lower than the VAP rates before education.
Conclusion
VAP care bundle implementation with education prepared according to evidence-based guidelines decreased VAP rates. Thus, implementation of the VAP care bundle on mechanically ventilated patients care is recommended."

Hand hygiene (HH) in health care facilities is a key component to reduce pathogen transmission and nosocomial infections. However, most HH interventions (HHI) have not been sustainable.
Aims
This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of recently published evidence-based HHI designed to improve HH compliance (HHC) that will enable health care providers to make informed choices when allocating limited resources to improve HHC and patient safety.
Methods
The Medline electronic database (using PubMed) was used to identify relevant studies. English language articles that included hand hygiene interventions and related terms combined with health care environments or related terms were included.
Results
Seventy-three studies that met the inclusion criteria were summarized. Interventions were categorized as improving awareness with education, facility design, and planning, unit-level protocols and procedures, hospital-wide programs, and multimodal interventions. Past successful HHIs may not be as effective when applied to other health care environments. HH education should be interactive and engaging. Electronic monitoring and reminders should be implemented in phases to ensure cost-effectiveness. To create hospitalwide programs that engage end users, policy makers should draw expertise from interdisciplinary fields. Before implementing the various components of multimodal interventions, health care practitioners should identify and examine HH difficulties unique to their organizations.
Conclusions
Future research should seek to achieve the following: replicate successful HHI in other health care environments, develop reliable HHC monitoring tools, understand caregiver-patient-family interactions, examine ways (eg, hospital leadership, financial support, and strategies from public health and infection prevention initiatives) to sustain HHC, and use simulated lab environments to refine study designs."

The emergence of carbapenem resistance has had a significant impact on both clinical and economic outcomes.
Methods
A retrospective, observational cohort study was performed in a 433-bed tertiary care medical center. The cohort was established from all inpatients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa–positive cultures over a 3-year period. Two multivariate models were developed: a logistic regression model to evaluate the primary outcome of in-hospital mortality and a linear regression model to evaluate the secondary outcome of total hospital cost.
Results
The adjusted odds ratio for in-hospital mortality among patients with meropenem-resistant isolates was 2.89 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-7.28). There were significantly more deaths in the meropenem-resistant group (28.1% vs 8.9%, P = .003). Patients with meropenem-resistant P aeruginosa experienced a 4-day increase in median length of stay versus those in the meropenem-susceptible group (14 vs 9 days, P = .004). Likewise, the percentage of patients who required intensive care unit (ICU) admission increased from 42% to 81.3% (P < .001). Meropenem resistance was also associated with a significant increase in total hospital cost by a factor of 1.42 among patients who were not admitted to the ICU (95% CI, 1.03-1.95).
Conclusions
Our results demonstrate that meropenem resistance was a significant predictor of in-hospital mortality. Carbapenem resistance also resulted in a significant increase in hospital cost, but only among patients who were not admitted to the ICU."

Methods
A retrospective cohort study was conducted under 4 phases from January 2008-December 2014. The hospital infection control (IC) policies and a presurgical checklist were bundled and implemented. The study was conducted with 3,334 cesarean deliveries: phase A (January 1, 2008-January 31,2010): 1,250 patients without intervention (baseline SSI rate), phase B (February 1, 2010-July 31, 2011): 682 patients were intervened with IC policies, phase C (August 1, 2011-December 31, 2012): 591 patients with an SSI reduction bundle, and phase D (January 1, 2013-December 31, 2014): 811 patients were monitored for C-section SSI sustainability. Patients not following strict protocols because of emergency C-section deliveries were excluded. The χ2 test, Fisher exact test, and standard Z test were used for statistical analyses.
Results
C-section SSI rates were 6.2% (77/1,250) in phase A, 3.7% (25/682) in phase B, 1.7% (10/591) in phase C, and 0.1% (1/811) in phase D, respectively. By implementing the IC policies and bundle, the C-section SSI rate was reduced 40.3% (phase B vs phase A), 72.6% (phase C vs phase A), and 98.4% (phase D vs phase A). All statistics were significantly different.
Conclusions
We conclude that implementing a C-section SSI reduction bundle was associated with reduced C-section SSI rate down toward zero. A future prospectively randomized controlled trial is warranted."

Deep sternal wound infection (DSWI) following cardiac surgery is a serious complication, but risk factors associated with DSWI have not been fully elucidated.
Methods
We analyzed all DSWI cases at our institution from 2010-2013 in adult cardiac median sternotomy cases, based on Society of Thoracic Surgeons or National Healthcare Safety Network definitions, but with 1-year surveillance postsurgery. Controls were matched 3:1 per case for procedure, age, and year of surgery. Demographic and operative data were pulled from Society of Thoracic Surgeons database and chart review. Potential variables were evaluated using univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression.
Results
Out of 1,894 surgeries performed, 39 DSWI cases (2%) and 117 controls were identified. In univariate analyses, patients with red blood cell (RBC) transfusion ≥ 4 units, any platelet transfusion, previous infections, and chronic infections were associated with higher DSWI. RBC transfusion ≥ 4 units (P = .037) and chronic infections (P = .029) remained significant risk factors for DSWI in multivariate analysis. Preoperative anemia alone was not associated with more DSWI, but its interaction with RBC transfusion ≥ 4 units was significant.

Human auditing and collating hand hygiene compliance data take hundreds of hours. We report on 24/7 overt observations to establish adjusted average daily hand hygiene opportunities (HHOs) used as the denominator in an automated surveillance that reports daily compliance rates.
Methods
Overt 24/7 automated surveillance collected HHOs in medical and surgical wards. Accredited auditors observed health care workers' interaction between patient and patient zones to collect the total number of HHOs, indications, and compliance and noncompliance. Automated surveillance captured compliance (ie, events) via low power radio connected to alcohol-based handrub (ABHR) dispensers. Events were divided by HHOs, adjusted for daily patient-to-nurse ratio, to establish daily rates.
Results
Human auditors collected 21,450 HHOs during 24/7 with 1,532 average unadjusted HHOs per day. This was 4.4 times larger than the minimum ward sample required for accreditation. The average adjusted HHOs for ABHR alone on the medical ward was 63 HHOs per patient day and 40 HHOs per patient day on the surgical ward. From July 1, 2014-July 31, 2015 the automated surveillance system collected 889,968 events.

Preventing the transmission of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) over the continuum of care presents an important challenge for infection control.
Methods
A prospective case-control study was conducted on patients admitted with CDI to a tertiary care hospital in Detroit between August 2012 and September 2013. Patients were then followed for 1 year by telephone interviews and the hospital administrative database. Cases, patients with interfacility transfers (IFTs), were patients admitted to our facility from another health care facility and discharged to long-term care (LTC) facilities. Controls were patients admitted from and discharged to home.
Results
There were 143 patients included in the study. Thirty-six (30%) cases were compared with 84 (70%) controls. Independent risk factors of CDI patients with IFTs (compared with CDI patients without IFTs) included Charlson Comorbidity Index score ≥6 (odds ratio [OR], 5.30; P = .016) and hospital-acquired CDI (OR, 4.92; P = .023). Patients with IFTs were more likely to be readmitted within 90 days of discharge than patients without IFTs (OR, 2.24; P = .046). One-year mortality rate was significantly higher among patients with IFTs than among patients without IFTs (OR, 4.33; P = .01).
Conclusions
With the growing number of alternate health care centers, it is highly critical to establish better collaboration between acute care and LTC facilities to tackle the increasing burden of CDI across the health care system."

Central line–associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and cost for U.S. hospitals, but many infections are preventable. Employees' willingness to speak up about errors or opportunities for improvement has been associated with a stronger safety culture in hospitals. However, the link between organizations' efforts to promote speaking up and prevent CLABSIs has not been studied.
Methods
This exploratory, qualitative study included interviews with 158 key informants, including hospital executives, managers, and staff employees, in 6 hospitals that participated in the federally funded On the CUSP—Stop BSI initiative. Verbatim transcripts were analyzed to examine whether and how speaking up was addressed in CLABSI prevention efforts.
Results
Hospitals implementing evidence-based practices for CLABSI prevention facilitated employees' improvement-oriented speaking up by leveraging quality improvement and care management processes. Leader behavior, employee training, and error reporting systems also facilitated speaking up. Although the focus of this study was on CLABSI prevention, broader organizational practices to improve patient safety were salient in creating a nonpunitive, highly inclusive environment in which employees felt comfortable speaking up.
Conclusions
These findings provide insight into the factors that may support speaking up to foster a safety culture and prevent health care–associated infection at unit and organization levels."

abstract = "Background
The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of a multidimensional infection control approach and the use of the International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC) Surveillance Online System on central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) rates from June 2003-April 2010.
Methods
We conducted a prospective, before-after surveillance study of 2,564 patients hospitalized in 4 adult intensive care units (ICUs) and 424 patients in 2 pediatric ICUs of 4 hospitals in 2 cities of Colombia. During baseline, we performed outcome surveillance of CLABSI applying the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network definitions. During intervention, we implemented the INICC multidimensional approach and the ISOS, which included a bundle of infection prevention practice interventions, education, outcome surveillance, process surveillance, feedback on CLABSI rates and consequences, and performance feedback of process surveillance. Bivariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed using a logistic regression model to estimate the effect of the intervention on the CLABSI rate.
Results
The baseline rate of 12.9 CLABSIs per 1,000 central line (CL) days, with 3,032 CL days and 39 CLABSIs, was reduced to 3.5 CLABSIs per 1,000 CL days, with 3,686 CL days and 13 CLABSIs, accounting for a 73% CLABSI rate reduction (relative risk, 0.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.52; P=.002).
Conclusions
Implementing the INICC multidimensional infection control approach for CLABSI prevention was associated with a significant reduction in the CLABSI rate of ICUs of Colombia."

Peracetic acid sporicidal wipes have been shown to be an effective disinfectant, but in controlled test environments. Their high cost may restrict use.
Aims
This pilot study investigated the efficacy and compared the costs of routine universal use of peracetic acid sporicidal wipes versus sporicidal quaternary ammonium compound and alcohol wipes in the disinfection of a hospital environment.
Methods
The routine universal use of peracetic acid wipes (Clinell Sporicidal; GAMA Healthcare Ltd, London, UK) was allocated to a study ward, whereas the control ward continued with the use of quaternary ammonium compound wipes (Tuffie 5; Vernacare, Bolton, UK) and alcohol wipes (PDI Sani-Cloth 70; PDI, Flint, UK). Twenty high-touch areas in the 2 wards were sampled for the presence of indicator organisms. The weekly detection rates of indicator organisms and weekly healthcare associated infection (HCAI) rates in the 2 wards were compared and examined for decreasing trends over the trial period.
Results
The detection rates of indicator organisms and HCAI rates were not significantly different in the 2 wards, and did not decrease significantly over the trial period. However, the peracetic acid wipes seem to be more effective against gram-negative organisms but at a significantly higher cost.
Conclusions
Further prospective studies are needed to assess the cost-effectiveness of peracetic acid wipes."

Hand hygiene at the point of care is recognized as a best practice for promoting compliance at the moments when hand hygiene is most critical. The objective of this study was to compare knowledge, attitudes, and practices of US and Canadian frontline health care personnel regarding hand hygiene at the point of care.
Methods
Physicians and nurses in US and Canadian hospitals were invited to complete a 32-question online survey based on evidence supporting point of care hand hygiene. Eligible health care personnel were in direct clinical practice at least 50% of the time.
Results
Three hundred fifty frontline caregivers completed the survey. Among respondents, 57.1% were from the United States and 42.9% were from Canada. Respondents were evenly distributed between physician and nurses. The US and Canadian respondents gave identical ranking to their perceived barriers to hand hygiene compliance. More than half of the respondents from both the United States and Canada agreed or strongly agreed that they would be more likely to clean their hands when recommended if alcohol-based handrub was closer to the patient.
Conclusion
This survey demonstrates that similarities between Canada and the United States were more common than not, and the survey raises, or suggests, potential knowledge gaps that require further illumination."

abstract = "Background
Surgical site infection (SSI) after colorectal surgery is a frequent complication associated with substantial morbidity. Our objective was to identify surgical predictors of SSI in patients undergoing colorectal surgery using a retrospective case-control design.
Material and Methods
Randomly selected patients from all those undergoing colorectal surgery (2007-2013). Cases were patients who developed SSI within 30 days. Controls were patients who did not develop SSI within 30 days. Patients undergoing multiple procedures during a single surgical intervention were excluded. SSI was diagnosed according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definitions. The main outcome measures were SSI, surgical variables, and cumulative survival (Kaplan-Meier method). Variables considered predictors were compared using log-rank test.
Results
Of 911 patients undergoing colorectal surgery, 221 developed SSI (24.3%; 95% confidence interval, 24.0-24.6). On univariate analysis, significant risk factors for SSI were: female sex (P = .02), >72 hours preoperative stay (P = .04), open surgery (P = .08), incision class: contaminated and dirty (P = .001), and emergency procedures (P = .006). On multivariate analysis, significant independent predictors of SSI and survival were dirty surgery (hazard ratio [HR], 2.12; P = .015), contaminated surgery (HR, 1.74; P = .009), female sex (HR, 1.58; P = .003), open surgery, (HR, 1.51; P = .015) and >72 hours preoperative stay (HR, 1.48; P = .024).
Conclusions
Dirty or contaminated surgery, female sex, open surgery, and >72 hours preoperative stay were significant predictors of SSI."

Patterns of contacts between health care workers and patients during seasonal epidemics are unknown. Our study objective was to compare the number and duration of contacts between health care workers and patients during a nonepidemic period versus a community influenza epidemic, and to identify supercontactors.
Methods
Our observational study was conducted in a short-stay geriatric unit of a university hospital. Contacts between individuals were recorded by active radio frequency identification devices. Contact patterns were compared between 2 periods according to contact number and duration. Each care period lasted 5 days in the nonepidemic and influenza epidemic periods.
Results
The study included 21 medical doctors, 43 nurses, and 56 patients. In total, 3,200 contacts (61.4%; 152,700 seconds) were recorded during the nonepidemic period, with 2,013 contacts (38.6%; 92,740 seconds) in the epidemic period (P = .007). More cumulative contacts occurred during the nonepidemic period between nurses and patients (n = 2,638 [82%] vs n = 1,599 [79%]), but not between patients (n = 56 [18%] vs n = 414 [21%]). Contact duration between nurses and patients lasted longer during the nonepidemic period (P = .04). During the epidemic period, 6 nurses (15%) considered to be supercontactors accounted for 44.3% of the total number of contacts with patients.
Conclusion
The pattern of contacts between individuals differed according to the presence or not of the community influenza peak that might have influenced the risk of nosocomial influenza."

Knee and hip replacements are an effective intervention for improving quality of life. Rates of these surgeries in North America are growing, coinciding with increasing obesity and an aging population.
Methods
Alberta Health Services' infection prevention and control program collects data prospectively on surgical site infections (SSIs) after primary total hip and knee arthroplasty completed in Alberta, Canada. We reviewed all SSIs within 180 days of surgical procedures between March 1, 2012, and June 30, 2014.
Results
There were 312 SSI cases reviewed. Rates of SSI (per 100 procedures) were 1.77 and 1.26 for hip and knee arthroplasties, respectively. Seventy-nine percent of infections occurred within 30 days postoperatively. Stratified by time to infection, larger proportions of knee SSIs occurred after 30 days versus hip SSI. Colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was associated with subsequent infection (odds ratio, 40; 95% confidence interval, 10.2-154.2). We have identified important characteristics that may be helpful for determining optimal prevention strategies.
Conclusions
Intensive postoperative follow-up within 30 days of knee arthroplasty may help to identify SSI early, allowing for prompt treatment and avoiding the need for invasive therapy, such as surgery for hardware revision. Decolonization techniques may decrease subsequent MRSA SSI in colonized patients."

Advances in the fields of biomedical technology, microbiology, pharmacology, and infection control and prevention, among others, have played a tremendous role in these efforts. However, evidence suggests that a key element in this battle against HAIs is missing: collaboration and communication between these groups in health care facilities—particularly in microbiology and infection prevention. The need for collaboration between infection preventionists (IPs) and laboratorians has been addressed in the literature; however, a survey conducted by the APIC and the American Society for Microbiology demonstrated that both IPs and laboratorians feel they lack the tools to engage in this collaboration.

abstract = "Background
The importance of hand hygiene in the prevention of health care–associated infection is well known. Experience with hand hygiene compliance (HHC) evaluation in hemodialysis units is scarce.
Methods
This study was a 3-phase, prospective longitudinal intervention study during a 5-month period in a 13-bed hemodialysis unit at a university hospital in Northern Mexico. The unit performs an average of 1,150 hemodialysis procedures per month. Compliance was evaluated by a direct observer and a video assisted observer. Feedback was given to health care workers in the form of educational sessions and confidential reports and video analysis of compliance and noncompliance.
Results
A total of 5,402 hand hygiene opportunities were registered; 5,201 during 7,820 minutes of video footage and 201 by direct observation during 1,180 minutes. Lower compliance during the baseline evaluation was observed by video monitoring compared with direct observation (P <0.05). Discrepancy between both methods was 29.2% (0.4%-59.8%); the average improvement in compliance during the study was 30.6% (range, 7.3%-75.5%). Global and Individual results for each subject revealed a statistically significant Improvement in the majority. Noncompliance according to WHO's 5 Moments for HH was greater for moment 5 (30.1%). We estimated that a health care worker in a hemodialysis unit could take 22-44.3% of working hours for proper hand hygiene compliance.
Conclusions
Video-assisted monitoring of hand hygiene is an excellent method for the evaluation of HHC in a hemodialysis unit; enhanced HHC can be achieved through a feedback program to the hemodialysis staff that includes video examples and confidential reports."

Globally, the health and economic burden posed by health care–associated infections (HAIs) remains wide and severe. To curb the burden associated with HAIs, countries, including Iran, aim at HAI prevention and control. This study explores the challenges faced by the Iranian health system in addressing the issues associated with the prevention and control of HAIs.
Methods
A qualitative research method was adopted in exploring the phenomenon. We used the purposive sampling approach in reaching 24 key informants at the national and subnational levels. The thematic framework analysis was conducted for analyzing the interviews.
Results
Five main themes emerged from our study demonstrating the obstacles toward the prevention and control of HAIs. They include governance and stewardship, resources, safety culture, monitoring and surveillance systems, and inappropriate prescription of antibiotics.
Conclusions
Strengthening of reporting and surveillance systems for HAIs coupled with proper governance and stewardship are crucial in order to improve the health and safety of patients. However, the availability of resources, through an intersectoral approach, is essential to achieve sustained output."

Pathogen transmission from contaminated surfaces can cause hospital-associated infections. Although pulsed xenon ultraviolet (PX-UV) light devices have been shown to decrease hospital room bioburden in the United States, their effectiveness in United Kingdom (UK) hospitals is less understood.
Methods
Forty isolation rooms at the Queens Hospital (700 beds) in North London, UK, were sampled for aerobic bacteria after patient discharge, after manual cleaning with a hypochlorous acid–troclosene sodium solution, and after PX-UV disinfection. PX-UV device efficacy on known organisms was tested by exposing inoculated agar plates in a nonpatient care area. Turnaround times for device usage were recorded, and a survey of hospital staff for perceptions of the device was undertaken.
Results
After PX-UV disinfection, the bacterial contamination measured in colony forming units (CFU) decreased by 78.4%, a 91% reduction from initial bioburden levels prior to terminal cleaning. PX-UV exposure resulted in a 5-log CFU reduction for multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) on spiked plates. The average device turnaround time was 1 hour, with minimal impact on patient throughput. Ward staff were enthusiastic about device deployment, and device operators reported physical comfort in usage.
Conclusions
PX-UV use decreased bioburden in patient discharge rooms and on agar plates spiked with MDROs. The implementation of the PX-UV device was well received by hospital cleaning and ward staff, with minimal disruption to patient flow."

abstract = "Background
Several clusters of Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infections associated with contaminated endoscopes have recently been reported. Interim guidelines for mitigating endoscope-associated transmission have been proposed, but there has not been a systematic appraisal of CRE prevention practices.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review of endoscope-associated CRE infection episodes, abstracting information on outbreak detection, mitigation, outcomes, and corrective steps taken to prevent recurrence.
Results
Seven distinct outbreaks were identified in the published literature, and 5 of these were associated with duodenal endoscopy, with the remaining 2 associated with cystoscopy and ureteroscopy. Several investigators noted difficulties in cleaning protocols surrounding difficult to access components, such as the elevator on duodenoscopes. The published investigations did not report any failures of sterilization. It is unclear if routine reprocessing was ineffective, or difficult to execute properly.
Conclusions
Meticulous cleaning protocols and increased surveillance are necessary to prevent and detect future outbreaks of CRE and to determine whether more stringent measures, such as sterilization, are needed for duodenoscopes."

Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) removed prematurely for unconfirmed infection or thrombosis lead to subsequent reinsertions and associated complications. To improve clinical quality, a mandatory electronic communication tool (MECT) based on clinical practice guidelines was mandated for all inpatient adult PICCs in an academically affiliated tertiary medical center. This MECT facilitated early communication and specialized evaluation with the PICC team for any complications related to PICCs.
Methods
A historical cohort study was conducted. Quality and cost measurements for 200 PICCs postinstitution of a MECT were compared with 200 PICCs 12 months prior. PICC removal and complication rates were compared for the 2 cohorts.
Results
Significant outcomes included a central-line associated blood stream infection rate that changed from 1.38/1,000 catheter days to 0/1,000 catheter days, 0 provider-led premature PICC removals, an overall 84% decrease in premature PICC removals (from 16%-2.5%; P < .0001), a decrease in the total complication rate from 45.5%-24% (P < .0001), and 25% reduction in radiology costs.
Conclusion
A novel infection prevention approach leveraging a MECT resulted in 0 central line-associated bloodstream infections and provider-led premature PICC removals."

Following a Clostridium difficile infection outbreak, the Infection Prevention and Control team at our institution queried the risk of transmission via bedpans reprocessed in washer disinfectors (WDs). This study's objective was to determine the effectiveness of the mechanical action, detergent, and temperature on the eradication of C difficile spores in 1 type of WD model.
Materials and methods
Three types of reusable bedpans/pots were inoculated with sterile human feces that contained 1 × 107 CFU/mL C difficile spores. The 0.3 mL fecal-spore suspension was inoculated in sealed cryovials. These items were reprocessed using the longest wash cycle of WDs in 9 clinical units, and then tested for residual C difficile spores. The number of colonies on each replicate organism detection and counting plate was recorded after anaerobic incubation at 35°C for 48 hours, and the log reduction was calculated.
Results
All 9 WDs met the manufacturer's operational specifications. Forty-three (96%) of 45 bedpans had no viable spores (>5.9 log10 C difficile spore reduction). Two bedpans had 1 to 2 spores remaining. Viable C difficile spores were isolated from all 9 cryovials.
Discussion and conclusions
Results demonstrated that when operating the WD as stipulated, C difficile spores were satisfactorily eliminated from bedpan surfaces. Temperature alone was insufficient to kill C difficile spores. It also suggested the importance of staff training, machine maintenance, and WD purchase specifications."

Prompted by the high number of central line–associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), our institution joined the national On the CUSP: Stop BSI initiative. We not only report the significant impact that the Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program (CUSP) had in reducing CLABSI, but also report catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in 2 intensive care units (ICUs).
Methods
At our community-based academic health care system, 2 ICUs implemented CUSP tools and developed local interventions to reduce CLABSI and other safety problems. We measured CLABSI, CAUTI, and VAP during baseline, the CUSP period, and a post-CUSP period.
Results
CLABSIs decreased from 3.9 per 1,000 catheter days at baseline to 1.2 during the CUSP period to 0.6 during the post-CUSP period (rate ratio, 0.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.07-0.35). CAUTIs decreased from 2.4 per 1,000 patient days to 1.2 during the post-CUSP period (rate ratio, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.24-0.65). VAP rate decreased from 2.7 per 1,000 ventilator days to 1.6 during the CUSP and post-CUSP periods (rate ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.30-1.10). Device utilization decreased significantly in both ICUs.
Conclusions
Implementation of CUSP was associated with significant decreases in CLABSI, CAUTI, and VAP. The CUSP model, allowing for implementation of evidence-based practices and engagement of frontline staff, creates sustainable improvements that reach far beyond the initial targeted problem."

To understand whether the burden of hand hygiene contributes to poor compliance we measured the daily number of hand hygiene opportunities (HHOs) by shift for nurses and physicians in 2 wards in a 850-bed university teaching hospital.
Methods
On each ward 4 trained auditors collected the number of HHOs and compliance events for 24 hours over 7 days. Twenty-one thousand four hundred fifty HHOs were collected from a medical and a surgical ward. The proportion of alcohol-based handrub used daily, the burden of hand hygiene, and compliance rates were calculated separately for nurses and physicians.
Results
The average indication for alcohol-based handrub cleansing represented 68% of all HHOs. Nurses had an average burden of 55 HHOs per 24 hours or 27 HHOs per shift, 3 times higher than the burden for physicians, who had 16 HHOs per 24 hours or 8 HHOs per shift. Overt observations of the weekly compliance identified nurses had 1.5 times higher compliance than physicians: 76% and 52% (P < .01), respectively.
Conclusions
Nurses have 3 times more HHOs than physicians, yet nurses have 1.5 times higher compliance than physicians. Hand hygiene compliance in physicians cannot be explained by burden of HHOs."

Displaying screen savers with gain-framed messages are effective to improve hand hygiene, but the design of screen savers has not been studied yet.
Methods
Based on the literature, scientific propositions were developed for the design of screen savers, exploring 2 strategies to subconsciously influence hand hygiene behavior; the first was to gain attention, and the second was to exert peer pressure. The designed screen savers were tested for attention with an eye-tracking study (N = 27) and for the influence of peer pressure with a questionnaire (N = 25).
Results
Twenty-five propositions for gaining attention concerned the format and color of the screen saver itself and color, position, and style of visual and text elements. Seven propositions for peer pressure concerned the influence of peers, role models, and feelings of being watched. Eye-tracking measurements showed that text on the 4 screen savers based on propositions gained more, earlier, and longer attention and the visual elements gained earlier and longer attention than the control screen savers. The questionnaire results showed that feelings of peer pressure were evoked by 3 screen savers; of these, one was not based on propositions.
Conclusions
Screen savers designed according to scientific propositions for visual attention and peer pressure have the potential to alter hand hygiene behavior."

For example, a patient admitted to a room previously occupied by a patient colonized or infected with one of these pathogens has a higher risk for acquiring one of these pathogens than a patient admitted to a room whose previous occupant was not colonized or infected. This risk is not surprising because multiple studies have demonstrated that surfaces in hospital rooms are poorly cleaned during terminal cleaning. To reduce surface contamination after terminal cleaning, no touch methods of room disinfection have been developed. This article will review the no touch methods, ultraviolet light devices, and hydrogen peroxide systems, with a focus on clinical trials which have used patient colonization or infection as an outcome. Multiple studies have demonstrated that ultraviolet light devices and hydrogen peroxide systems have been shown to inactivate microbes experimentally plated on carrier materials and placed in hospital rooms and to decontaminate surfaces in hospital rooms naturally contaminated with multidrug-resistant pathogens. A growing number of clinical studies have demonstrated that ultraviolet devices and hydrogen peroxide systems when used for terminal disinfection can reduce colonization or health care–associated infections in patients admitted to these hospital rooms."

Nosocomial pneumonia is one of the most common health care–associated infections in intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide, attributing to high morbidity and mortality. Our study aim is to investigate the effectiveness of oral hygiene with 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) and 0.08% metronidazole (MDE) influencing the microbiologic epidemiology and incidence of nonintubation pneumonia (NIP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
Methods
Patients who stayed >48 hours in the emergency ICU between 2008 and 2012 were enrolled and provided oral hygiene by swabbing with 0.08% MDE twice daily until discharge or death during the first year (period M), whereas CHX was applied during the following 3 years (period C). The incidence and microbiologic epidemiology of NIP and VAP were studied.
Results
There were 873 patients enrolled. There were 44 episodes of NIP and 25 episodes of VAP that occurred among 212 patients in period M, and 84 episodes of NIP and 49 episodes of VAP occurred among 661 patients in period C. Overall, the rate of NIP and VAP decreased year by year. Acinetobacter baumannii was the most frequently identified bacteria for NIP (22.9%) and VAP (25.3%), with an annual ascent. Few changes were observed on bacteria distribution for NIP and VAP.
Conclusions
Oral hygiene with CHX, having reduced the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia among critical ill patients, suggests a benefit of oral hygiene in decreasing the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia, including VAP in ICUs, but not bacterial epidemiology."

During hand antisepsis, health care workers (HCWs) are exposed to alcohol by dermal contact and by inhalation. Concerns have been raised that high alcohol absorptions may adversely affect HCWs, particularly certain vulnerable individuals such as pregnant women or individuals with genetic deficiencies of aldehyde dehydrogenase.
Methods
We investigated the kinetics of HCWs' urinary concentrations of ethanol and its metabolite ethyl glucuronide (EtG) during clinical work with and without previous consumption of alcoholic beverages by HCWs.
Results
The median ethanol concentration was 0.7 mg/L (interquartile range [IQR], 0.5-1.9 mg/L; maximum, 9.2 mg/L) during abstinence and 12.2 mg/L (IQR, 1.5-139.6 mg/L; maximum, 1,020.1 mg/L) during alcohol consumption. During abstinence, EtG reached concentrations of up to 958 ng/mL. When alcohol consumption was permitted, the median EtG concentration of all samples was 2,593 ng/mL (IQR, 890.8-3,576 ng/mL; maximum, 5,043 ng/mL). Although alcohol consumption was strongly correlated with both EtG and ethanol in urine, no significant correlation for the frequency of alcoholic hand antisepsis was observed in the linear mixed models.
Conclusions
The use of ethanol-based handrub induces measurable ethanol and EtG concentrations in urine. Compared with consumption of alcoholic beverages or use of consumer products containing ethanol, the amount of ethanol absorption resulting from handrub applications is negligible. In practice, there is no evidence of any harmful effect of using ethanol-based handrubs as much as it is clinically necessary."

Surgical site infections (SSIs) complicate surgery, resulting in higher morbidity and mortality. Infection control bundles and antibiotic stewardship can be effective at reducing SSIs. The influence of long-term serial interventions is unclear.
Objective
The goal of this retrospective quasiexperimental study was to assess the influence of a 5-year serial infection control and antibiotic stewardship intervention on SSIs.
Methods
The multidisciplinary program actively implemented pre-, intra-, and postoperative strategies over a 5-year period from 2009-2014 for all patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), valve replacement, or both at a tertiary care public institution. Outcomes are compared with a 2-year preinterventions period (2007-2009) and 1-year postinterventions period (2014-2015).
Results
A total of 6,518 procedures were included. After interventions, the overall combined infection rate for CABG, CABG and valve, and valve procedures decreased by 66.3%, from 11.9%-4.0% (odds ratio, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.49; P < .001). A significant decrease of >50% (P < .001) relative rate was observed in overall, sternum, leg, CABG, and combined CABG and valve infection rates when comparing pre- and postinterventions groups. The antibiotic stewardship intervention increased overall conformity to the internal surgical prophylaxis protocol by 46.8%, from 39.8%-86.6% (95% confidence interval, 41.0-52.4; P < .001).

Results
The influenza vaccination rate of all employees significantly increased from 56% (8,762/15,693) in 2006-2007 to 94% (17,927/19,114) in 2013-2014 (P < .0001). The 2009 mandatory participation program increased HCW vaccination rates in the targeted groups (P < .0001), and the addition of an institutional policy in 2012 requiring influenza vaccination or surgical mask use with each patient contact further increased vaccination rates by 10%-18% for all groups in 1 year. The proportion of nosocomial influenza infections significantly decreased (P = .045) during the study period and was significantly associated with increased HCW vaccination rates in the nursing staff (P = .043) and in personnel working in high-risk areas (P = .0497).

The use of chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) as an intraoperative vaginal preparation has been shown to be more effective than vaginal povidone-iodine (PI) in decreasing vaginal bacterial colony counts. However, PI remains the standard vaginal preparation because of concerns of CHG's potential for vaginal irritation. The primary outcome of this study is a comparison of the rate of patient-reported vaginal irritation between 2% CHG and PI.
Methods
Consecutive patients were enrolled in a pre-post study. Group 1 consisted of consecutive patients who received PI as a vaginal preparation. Group 2 consisted of consecutive patients who received 2% CHG as a vaginal preparation. Patients used a standardized instrument to report irritation to trained nurse practitioners 1 day after surgery.

A total of 117 patients received vaginal operative preparation during the course of the study, with 64 patients in group 1 and 53 patients in group 2. Of the patients in group 1, 60 (93.7%) reported no vaginal irritation, 3 (4.69%) reported mild irritation, and 1 (1.56%) reported moderate irritation. In group 2 (2% CHG vaginal preparation), all of the patients (100%) reported no vaginal irritation (P = .38).
Conclusions
The use of 2% CHG as a vaginal operative preparation is not associated with increased vaginal irritation compared with PI in gynecologic surgery. It can safely be used, taking advantage of its efficacy in reducing vaginal bacterial colony counts."

abstract = "Background
First detected in the United States in 1996, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) has spread internationally among gram-negative bacteria, especially K pneumoniae. These microorganisms can cause serious infections in hospitalized patients, and there are few therapeutic options, culminating in increased mortality. The objective of this study was to describe the occurrence of outbreaks that were caused by KPC-producing K pneumoniae, emphasizing the interventions that were implemented to contain the outbreaks.
Methods
PubMed, Web of Knowledge, and Literatura Latino Americana em Ciências da Saúde databases were searched for articles that were published between 2001 and 2012 according to the recommendations of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.
Results
Of the 586 studies identified, 13 were selected for the final sample. Most studies showed that the containment of KPC outbreaks is possible in hospital settings through several actions, particularly use of surveillance cultures and the establishment of contact precautions.
Conclusions
The results show that limiting the cross-transmission of these and other KPC-producing bacteria is possible in a hospital setting. However, such isolates need to be detected early with the aid of culture surveillance and contained early using appropriate actions immediately to prevent an outbreak."

Little is known about childcare agency staff vaccination requirements, parents' perceptions of these requirements, or vaccine uptake in these populations.
Methods
A questionnaire was administered to St Louis parents and childcare agency staff in fall of 2014. The χ2 tests compared staff's versus parents' uptake of hepatitis A, pertussis, and seasonal influenza vaccines. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine individuals being fully immunized (ie, having received influenza, hepatitis A, and pertussis vaccines).
Results
Overall, 351 parents and staff from 23 agencies participated (response rate, 32%). One-third of staff (34.4%, n = 33) and parents (37.6%, n = 96) were fully immunized. Parents and staff were equally likely to have received the influenza vaccine (48.8% and 47.3%, respectively), but more staff received the hepatitis A vaccine (85.3% vs 67.5%, χ2 = 11.0, P < .001), and more parents received the pertussis vaccine (66.5% vs 45.8%, χ2 = 12.5, P < .001). Determinants of being fully immunized included having previously received the influenza vaccine, being offered the vaccines, belief that vaccination is important, having immunization recommendation awareness, and not having vaccine misperceptions.
Conclusions
Childcare agency staff vaccination can protect employees and children from disease, but their uptake of vaccines needs improvement. Future interventions should be aimed at increasing uptake to lower disease transmission in childcare settings."

Both hospital admissions and patient isolation increase during influenza season. Influenza testing methodologies that reduce turnaround time (TAT) could reduce time in isolation.
Methods
We assessed the impact of a new influenza test on TAT and isolation days. TAT and daily mean isolation days were compared at a single hospital over 2 influenza seasons. An automated real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (rRT-PCR) with random access replaced a conventional rRT-PCR assay for the second influenza season. Automation and random access allowed continuous testing, rather than once daily testing 3-5 d/wk.
Results
Confirmed influenza cases (57 vs 68) and total patient days (66,308 vs. 66,366) were similar for the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 influenza seasons. TAT fell from 35 to 3.6 hours. Daily mean isolation days (32.9 vs 27.7, P < .01) fell, as did days in contact precautions (25.0 vs 19.8, P < .01) and droplet precautions (6.0 vs 3.5, P < .01). Although daily mean droplet precaution days for confirmed influenza rose slightly (0.86 vs 1.1, P = .16), droplet precaution days for suspected influenza fell 85% (2.7 vs 0.41, P < .001).

This study assessed reporting behavior and satisfaction with postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) systems among health care workers (HCWs) at risk for occupational bloodborne pathogen exposure (BPE) in 3 public hospitals in Botswana.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey among HCWs provided information on perceptions, attitudes, and experiences with occupational exposures, reporting, and postexposure care. HCWs potentially in contact with blood or body fluids were surveyed using audio computer-assisted self-interview.
Results
Between August 2012 and April 2013, 1,624 HCWs completed the survey; most were women (72%), and almost half (48%) were nurses. Sixty-seven percent of them had ever received training related to BPE management; 62% perceived themselves to be at high risk for BPE. Among the 426 HCWs who were exposed to sharps injuries or splashes in the last 6 months, 160 (37%) reported the exposure. Of these, 111 of the 160 (69%) received PEP, and 79 of the 111 (71%) completed their medication. Whereas >92% of the total HCWs had ever been tested for HIV, only 557 (37%) were tested in their own health facility. Most HCWs (87%, n = 1,406) reported they would be interested in testing themselves. Of HCWs who reported an exposure, less than half (49%, n = 78) were satisfied with existing reporting systems.
Conclusions
Underreporting of occupational exposures and dissatisfaction with PEP management is common among HCWs. Improved PEP management strategies and regular monitoring are needed."

Enterococcal bloodstream infections (EBSIs) are frequently polymicrobial but scant data describe the outcomes and risk factors of polymicrobial EBSI. This study describes the outcomes and risk factors of polymicrobial versus monomicrobial EBSI.
Methods
In this single-center, retrospective, matched cohort study, patients with polymicrobial EBSI were matched 1:1 to patients with monomicrobial EBSI by age ± 10 years, EBSI source, Pitt bacteremia score, and enterococcal species. Conditional logistic regression was performed to determine independent predictors of 30-day mortality and polymicrobial EBSI.
Results
In 142 matched pairs, 30-day mortality was 18.3% versus 21.1% (P = .551) in monomicrobial and polymicrobial EBSI, respectively. In multivariable analysis, recent chemotherapy/radiation (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 4.799; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.814-12.696), chronic renal disease (aOR, 2.310; 95% CI, 1.176-4.539), and Pitt bacteremia score (aOR, 1.399; 95% CI, 1.147-1.706) were associated with 30-day mortality. Recent chemotherapy/radiation (aOR, 2.770; 95% CI, 1.016-7.551), and recent antibiotic exposure (aOR, 1.892; 95% CI, 1.157-3.092) were positively associated with polymicrobial EBSI, whereas chronic hemodialysis was negatively associated (aOR, 0.496; 95% CI, 0.29-81).
Conclusions
Overall, polymicrobial EBSI were not independently associated with mortality. Risk factors for, and the clinical implications of, polymicrobial EBSI should be further studied to inform clinical management and improve outcomes."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently introduced the concept of mucosal barrier injury (MBI) in an attempt to recognize the possibility of a gastrointestinal source for certain bloodstream infections. This could underestimate the central venous catheter (CVC) as the source of central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) in cancer. The definition of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) by the Infectious Diseases Society of America is a more specific and stringent definition that identifies the CVC as the source of infection. In our study, we compared the 2 definitions in cancer patients.
Methods
We retrospectively reviewed 149 CLABSI cases that occurred at our center between January 2013 and March 2014 who had 2 simultaneously positive blood cultures drawn from the CVC and peripheral site or concurrent paired tip and blood cultures.
Results
Of the 149 patients with CLABSI, only 70 (47%) had definite CRBSI. CRBSI was identified more commonly in non-MBI CLABSI cases than MBI CLABSI (69% vs 18%, P < .0001).
Conclusions
The CRBSI definition may be more accurate in identifying the catheter as the source of bloodstream infection in patients with MBI. Because CRBSI continues to occur in patients with MBI, we caution against excluding all MBI patients from CLABSI surveillance."

A retrospective study was designed to compare 2 periods: the prebundle and bundle periods. We evaluated the impact of a CLB including implementation of split-septum (SS) devices and single-use prefilled flushing (SUF) devices in critically ill children.
Results
During the prebundle period, the overall rate was 24.5 CLABSIs per 1,000 central line (CL) days, whereas after the initiation of the CLB, the CLABSIs per 1,000 CL days dropped to 14.29. In the prebundle period, the daily cost per patient with CL and CLABSI were $232.13 and $254.83 consecutively. In the bundle period, the daily cost per patient with CL and CLABSI were $226.62 and $194.28 consecutively. Compared with the period with no CLB, the CLB period, which included SUF and SS devices, resulted in more costs saving by lowering the daily total costs of patients and indirectly lowering total drug costs by decreasing antibacterial and more significantly antifungal drugs.
Conclusions
CLB programs including SS and SUF devices were found to be effective in decreasing the CLABSI rate and decreasing the daily hospital costs and antimicrobial drug expenditures in children."

Methods
Consecutive hospitalized patients during a 48-month study period with an SA HABSI were categorized according to those who did and did not meet the NHSN's definitions for CLABSI and non-CLABSI. Primary outcomes were mortality at 30 days and 1 year. Secondary outcomes were the incidence of complicated bacteremia and the need for operative intervention secondary to the HABSI event.
Results
A total of 122 episodes of primary SA HABSIs were identified: 78 (64%) were CLABSIs, and 44 (36%) were non-CLABSIs. Overall 30-day and 1-year mortality in the cohort was 21.3% and 38.5%, respectively, and did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Complicated SA HABSI was significantly more common in the non-CLABSI group (15.9% [n = 7] vs 0% [n = 0], P ≤ .001).
Conclusions
Primary SA HABSI was associated with significant 30-day and 1-year mortality. Complications from SA non-CLABSI requiring surgical intervention were significantly more common than in those with a CLABSI event. Our findings affirm the significance of non–device-related hospital-acquired infections."

In addition, decontamination of shared medical devices between use by different patients is also recommended. Environmental surfaces and noncritical shared medical devices are decontaminated by low-level disinfectants, most commonly phenolics, quaternary ammonium compounds, improved hydrogen peroxides, and hypochlorites. Concern has been raised that the use of germicides by health care personnel may increase the risk of these persons for developing respiratory illnesses (principally asthma) and contact dermatitis. Our data demonstrate that dermatitis and respiratory symptoms (eg, asthma) as a result of chemical exposures, including low-level disinfectants, are exceedingly rare. Unprotected exposures to high-level disinfectants may cause dermatitis and respiratory symptoms. Engineering controls (eg, closed containers, adequate ventilation) and the use of personal protective equipment (eg, gloves) should be used to minimize exposure to high-level disinfectants. The scientific evidence does not support that the use of low-level disinfectants by health care personnel is an important risk for the development of asthma or contact dermatitis."

Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as a major cause of outbreaks of hospital-associated infections with increased morbidity and mortality among those affected.
Methods
We performed a 1:1 matched case-control study involving 68 cases in a teaching hospital in Northern Italy. Risk factors included general health conditions, comorbidities, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and antibiotic therapies. A multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) was performed to highlight possible association patterns among risk factors. After this, a conditional logistic regression model was applied.
Results
The combined results of the MCA and univariate regression models suggest that invasive procedures performed before intensive care unit admission, in particular bronchoscopy (odds ratio, 48.06) and oxygen therapy (odds ratio, 2.11), are associated with development of an infection. Malnutrition or obesity, lack of self-sufficiency, and severe liver diseases also proved to be significantly associated with infection. When analyzing antibiotic therapies, both the number of molecules administered and duration of therapy were significantly associated.
Conclusions
Early recognition of patients at high risk, environmental hygiene control measures, appropriate antibiotic prescriptions, especially regarding carbapenems, and high-quality training of health care workers in all hospital departments are all key aspects for prevention and control of Acinetobacter infection. Further studies are needed to investigate the role of antibiotics on microbial competition dynamics in relation to multidrug-resistant outbreaks."

We investigated changes in the quantity of S aureus on the hands and changes in skin damage when using a hand-cleansing formulation with potassium oleate but without a sanitizer (formulation A), which is highly effective in removing S aureus biofilm and causes minimal skin damage.
Material and Methods
The participants (14 medical staff members) used 2 types of hand-cleansing formulations (formulations A and B), each for 4 weeks. S aureus of the hands was cultured from swab samples on agar plates. Surface of hands was measured using an ultraviolet light microscope.
Results and Discussion
The quantity of S aureus after using formulation A for 4 weeks was 101.08 ± 0.05 CFU/mL, a statistically significant decrease from the quantity of S aureus (101.59 ± 0.19 CFU/mL) just before use (P = .029). Also, dryness of hand surfaces decreased. With formulation B, the quantity of S aureus did not significantly change from before to after use (P > .05). This presumably occurs because formulation A gently removes S aureus biofilm.
Conclusions
Formulation A removed S aureus from the hands of participants, and skin damage on the hands improved."

abstract = "Background
Central line–associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are a common life-threatening risk factor associated with central venous catheters (CVCs). Research has demonstrated benefit in reducing CLABSIs when CVCs coated with antimicrobials are inserted. The impact of chlorhexidine (CHG)-impregnated versus non-CHG peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) on risk of CLABSI is unknown. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is also a complication associated with CVCs. This study compares the impact of both PICC lines on these outcomes.
Methods
Patients in 3 high-risk units were randomly assigned to receive either a CHG-impregnated or non-CHG PICC line. Laboratory data were collected and reviewed daily on all study patients. The PICC dressing site was assessed daily. Medical record documentation was reviewed to determine presence of CLABSI or VTE.
Results
There were 167 patients who completed the study. Three patients developed CLABSI (2 in the CHG group, and 1 in the non-CHG group), and 3 patients developed VTE (2 in the non-CHG group, and 1 in the CHG group). No significant relationship was noted between the type of PICC line on development of a CLABSI (P = .61) or VTE (P > .99). A significant difference was noted in moderate bleeding (P ≤ .001) requiring thrombogenic dressing in the patients who had the CHG PICC line.
Conclusions
No differences were noted in the development of CLABSI and VTE between the CHG and non-CHG groups."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put forth the recommendation to clean areas considered high touch more frequently than minimal touch surfaces. The operating room was not included in these recommendations. The purpose of this study was to determine the most frequently touched surfaces in the operating room and their level of contamination.
Methods
Phase 1 was a descriptive study to identify high touch areas in the operating room. In phase 2, high touch areas determined in phase 1 were cultured to determine if high touch areas observed were also highly contaminated and if they were more contaminated than a low touch surface.
Results
The 5 primary high touch surfaces in order were the anesthesia computer mouse, OR bed, nurse computer mouse, OR door, and anesthesia medical cart. Using the OR light as a control, this study demonstrated that a low touch area was less contaminated than the high touch areas with the exception of the OR bed.
Conclusions
Based on information and data collected in this study, it is recommended that an enhanced cleaning protocol be established based on the most frequently touched surfaces in the operating room."

Pertussis is an underestimated disease. Several European countries have developed models to account for underreporting of pertussis. The aim of this study was to estimate pertussis underdetection and underreporting in pediatric patients attending primary health care centers (PHCCs).
Methods
We reviewed clinical records of PHCCs in Barcelona in 2012. Factors associated with underdetection and underreporting were analyzed by logistic regression. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated.
Results
We included 3,505 children aged < 7 years (mean age, 34  ±  20.7 months; range, 0-82 months) presenting with cough; 9.3% (326 out of 3,505) of patients also had ≥ 1 symptoms related to pertussis accompanied by cough for a duration ≥ 2 weeks. Of the 326 children receiving clinical criteria, only 31 (9.5%) were laboratory-confirmed and 6 (1.8%) were detected but not reported. There were 295 (90.5%) undetected suspected pertussis cases. Age ≥ 18 months (aOR, 8.51; 95% CI, 1.82-39.86), cyanosis (aOR, 6.71; 95% CI, 1.43-31.39), request for chest radiograph (aOR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.07-0.99), and request for other laboratory tests (aOR, 5.39; 95% CI, 2.19-13.27) were associated with underdetection. Paroxysmal cough (aOR, 5.77; 95% CI, 1.05-31.76) and request for other laboratory tests (aOR, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.11-7.62) were associated with underreporting.
Conclusions
Both underdetection and underreporting complicate the understanding of pertussis epidemiology. Correct assessment of pertussis symptoms and notification of cases must be improved to control pertussis."

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the main cause of infectious complications in renal transplant (RTx) recipients and are considered as a potential risk factor for poorer graft outcomes. However, the risk factors of UTIs are controversial. We estimated the incidence and predisposing factors of UTIs in patients undergoing RTx.
Methods
Seventeen studies (6,671 patients) evaluated the prevalence and the risk factors of UTIs in patients with RTx published January 2000-October 2014 were included. The data were pooled using the fixed effect model or DerSimonian-Laird random effect model according to I2.
Results
Thirteen eligible articles with a total of 3,364 patients were evaluated and the pooled prevalence of UTIs was 38.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29%-47%; P < .01). The estimated risk factors for UTI include female sex (odds ratio [OR], 3.11; 95% CI, 2.10-4.13), older age (OR, 1.032; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04), duration of catheter (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.03-2.03), acute rejection episodes (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.11-2.41), and receiving a kidney from a deceased donor (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.09-1.52).
Conclusions
More than one-third of RTx patients had at least 1 UTI after surgery. Female sex, older age of the recipient, long duration of catheter, acute rejection episodes, and cadaveric donor were associated with higher risk of UTI."

Many factors associated with hospital-acquired infections (HAIs), including reimbursement policies, drug prices, practice patterns, and the distribution of organisms causing infections, change over time. We examined whether outcomes, including mortality, length of stay (LOS), daily charges, and total charges associated with HAIs, changed during 2006-2012.
Methods
Electronic data on adults discharged from 2 tertiary-quaternary hospitals and 1 community hospital during 2006-2012 were collected retrospectively. Computerized algorithms identified infections using laboratory and administrative codes. Propensity scores were used to match cases with uninfected controls. Differences in mortality, LOS, daily charges, and total charges were modeled against infection status and time period (2006-2008 vs 2009-2012), including interaction for infection status by time period.
Results
Among 352,077 discharges, 24,466 HAIs were detected. There was no significant change in mortality. LOS declined only for bloodstream infections (3-day reduction; P < 0.01). Daily charges rose 4% for urinary tract infections but did not change significantly for other HAIs. Total charges declined by 11% for bloodstream infections and 13% for pneumonia.
Conclusions
We found no appreciable or consistent improvement in HAI mortality or LOS during 2006-2012. Costs of bloodstream infections and pneumonia have declined, with most of the change occurring before 2008."

Health care workers (HCWs) use their mobile phones during working hours or medical care. There is evidence that the instruments are colonized with pathogenic microorganisms. Here, we describe levels of Enterobacteriaceae contamination (EC) in cell phones and the risk factors associated with EC in Peruvian intensive care units (ICUs).
Methods
This was a 5-month cohort study among 114 HCWs of 3 pediatric and 2 neonatology ICUs from 3 Peruvian hospitals. A baseline survey collected data on risk factors associated with EC. Swabs were collected from HCWs' phones every other week.
Results
Three-quarters of HCWs never decontaminated their phones, and 47% reported using the phones in the ICU >5 times while working. EC was frequent across samplings and sites and was substantially higher in subjects with longer follow-up. Potential risk factors identified did not have strong associations with positive samples (relative risk, 0.7-1.5), regardless of significance. Half of the phones were colonized with an Enterobacteriaceae at least once during the 4 samplings attained on average during the study period. Half of the isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR), and 33% were extended-spectrum β-lactamase producers.
Conclusions
EC on HCWs' phones was frequent and apparently randomly distributed through the hospitals without clear clustering or strongly associated risk factors for having a positive sample. Based on the level of EC, phones may be considered as potential bacterial reservoirs of MDR and ESBL bacteria."

Worldwide, enteric viruses are the main cause of acute gastroenteritis. In humans, these viruses spread via person-to-person contact, food, water, and/or the environment. Their survival and inactivation on hard surfaces have been extensively studied; however, nonlaunderable soft surfaces, such as upholstery and carpet, have received little attention. The aim of this systematic review was to determine factors that influence the survival and inactivation of enteric viruses on nonlaunderable soft surfaces.
Methods
EBSCO and Web of Science were searched for experimental studies published between 1965 and 2015 using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses methods. Titles and abstracts were screened using 3 eligibility criteria. The quality of all study methods was also assessed.
Results
Our search yielded 12 articles. Viruses survived between 0 hours and 140 days depending on surface and environment conditions. Virus survival was influenced by temperature, relative humidity, organic content, and deposition method. A variety of chemistries were tested across studies and were shown to have a varied effect on enteric viruses. Chlorine, glutaraldehyde, vaporous ozone, and hydrogen peroxide were the most efficacious against enteric viruses (> 3-log reduction).
Conclusions
Environmental factors, such as temperature and relative humidity, can influence survival of enteric viruses on nonlaunderable soft surfaces. The efficacy of liquid and vaporous chemistries are associated with surface and virus type."

Antibiotic resistance is a threat to global health security. We assessed knowledge, attitudes, and practices in regard to antibiotic prescribing and resistance in Cambodian physicians from public hospitals.
Methods
A cross-sectional knowledge, attitudes, and practices survey was distributed to physicians from 19 public hospitals.
Results
The response rate was 78% (689 out of 881). The majority (88%; 607 out of 686) of physicians understood that antibiotic resistance was a local challenge. More than half (54%; 366 out of 682) believed that antibiotic prescribing was inappropriate in their hospital and 93% (638 out of 684) had difficulties in selecting appropriate antibiotics to treat common infections. The majority (86%; 574 out of 667) and one-third of physicians (36%; 236 out of 665) would prescribe antibiotics for uncomplicated common cold and diarrhea in children < 5 years of age, respectively. Half (58%; 385 out of 668) had experience treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, but the majority (73%; 188 out of 258) could not identify antibiotics to treat this infection. Only 17% (115 out of 667) had experience treating endemic melioidosis. All physicians agreed that knowledge about local antibiotic resistance, treatment guidelines, and educational programs were necessary.
Conclusions
Cambodian physicians are aware of antibiotic resistance challenges but they do not possess the required knowledge of local antibiotic resistance patterns that would assist their prescribing practices. Cambodian physicians need support to improve antibiotic prescribing."

abstract = "Background
Standard precautions (SPs) are designed to limit bloodborne pathogen exposures among health care workers (HCWs) and health care–associated infections. SP adherence is globally suboptimal; however, reasons are underexplored. This study aim was to explore the relationships among safety climate factors and SP adherence by HCWs in hospitals using newly developed survey and observational tools.
Methods
Cross-sectional data from 11 units in 5 hospitals were collected between March and September 2015. A patient safety and standard precaution survey was administered to nurses and pooled with data from observations of HCW-patient interactions using defined SP indications. Descriptive statistics of distributions, frequencies, and Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to determine the unit-level relationships among dimensions of the patient safety climate and unit percentages of SP adherence (P < .05).
Results
There were 540 HCW-patient encounters with 1,713 SP indications and 140 surveys collected. Although most nurses (94%) reported always or often adhering to SPs and generally reported positive scores on unit safety climate, observed SP adherence was 62% (unit range, 31%-80%). Only 30% of nurses rated staffing positively, and this was inversely related to observed SP adherence.
Conclusions
Adherence to the full complement of observed SP behaviors by HCWs of all types was suboptimal. The relationship between safety climate, particularly staffing, and adherence to SPs warrants further testing."

abstract = "Background
The delivery of health care in outpatient settings has steadily increased over the past 40 years. The risk of infection in these settings is considered to be low. However, the increasing severity of illness and complexity of care in outpatient settings creates a need to reexamine the transmission of pathogens in this setting.
Materials and Methods
Seventeen health care workers from 4 wound care facilities were sampled during 46 patient care encounters to determine the presence of health care-associated pathogens (ie, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter species, and Clostridium difficile) on their hands at key moments of care.
Results
Health care workers acquired at least 1 pathogen on their hands during 28.3% of all patient care encounters. Hands sampled before a clean or aseptic procedure and hands sampled after body fluid exposure risk were each contaminated in 17.4% of instances. Hand contamination occurred in 19.6% of instances where health care workers wore gloves during care compared with 14.6% when health care workers were ungloved.
Conclusions
Contamination of health care workers' hands presents a significant risk of pathogen transmission in outpatient settings. Gloving education, hand hygiene solutions at the point of care, and hand hygiene surveillance are important solutions for reducing transmission of pathogenic organisms."

abstract = "Background
The objective of this study was to assess the ability of different detergent and disinfectant combinations to eradicate bacteria in traditional biofilm.
Methods
Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used to develop biofilm over 8 days. The biofilm on each minimum biofilm eradication concentration peg contained 8 log10 colony forming units (CFU)/cm2 of both bacteria. The detergents evaluated were as follows: Prolystica Enzymatic 2X, Prolystica Neutral 2X, Neodisher, and Endozime Bio-Clean. The disinfectants evaluated were as follows: glutaraldehyde, accelerated hydrogen peroxide, and ortho-phthalaldehyde. Biofilm removal was evaluated using viable count, protein and carbohydrate quantitation, and scanning electron microscopy.
Results
Only Prolystica Enzymatic 2X and Endozime Bio-Clean killed both E faecalis (3.90 log10 CFU/mL reduction) and P aeruginosa (3.96 log10 CFU/mL reduction) in suspension. None of the detergents tested could provide >1 log10 CFU/cm2 reduction for bacteria within biofilm. Any combination of detergent and high-level disinfectant reduced the level of both E faecalis and P aeruginosa within biofilm by 3-5 log10 CFU/cm2. Although the combination of Endozime Bio-Clean and glutaraldehyde provided a 6 log10 reduction, it could not eliminate both bacteria within biofilm.
Conclusions
Our data indicate that if biofilm accumulates in flexible endoscope channels during repeated rounds of reprocessing, then neither the detergent nor high-level disinfectant will provide the expected level of bacterial removal or killing."

The aim of this prospective multicenter study was to explore the usefulness of a modified World Health Organization (WHO) hand hygiene program to increase compliance with hand hygiene among health care workers (HCWs) in Latvia, Lithuania, Saint Petersburg (Russia), and Sweden and to provide a basis for continuing promotion of hand hygiene in these countries. The study was carried out in 2012. Thirteen hospitals participated, including 38 wards.
Methods
Outcome data were handrub consumption, compliance with hand hygiene measured with a modified WHO method, and assessment of knowledge among HCWs. Interventions were education of the nursing staff, posters and reminders in strategic places in the wards, and feedback of the results to nursing staff in ward meetings.
Results
Feedback of results was an effective tool for education at the ward level. The most useful outcome measurement was handrub consumption, which increased by at least 50% in 30% of the wards. In spite of this, handrub consumption remained at a low level in many of the wards.
Conclusions
There are several reasons for this, and the most important were self-reported nursing staff shortage and fear of adverse effects from using alcoholic handrub and verified skin irritation."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the importance of supervision through video surveillance in improving the quality of personal protection in preparing health care workers working in Ebola treatment units.
Methods
Wardens supervise, remind, and guide health care workers' behavior through onsite voice and video systems when they are in the suspected patient observation ward and in the patient diagnosed ward of the Ebola treatment center. The observation results were recorded, and timely feedback was given to the health care workers.
Results
After 2 months of supervision, 1,797 cases of incorrect personal protection behaviors were identified and corrected. The error rate continuously declined. The declined rate of the first 2 weeks was statistically different from other time periods. Through reminding and supervising, nonstandard personal protective behaviors can be discovered and corrected, which can help health care workers standardize personal protection. The timely feedback from video surveillance can also offer psychologic support and encouragement promptly to ease psychologic pressure. Finally, this can ensure health care workers stay at a zero infection rate during patient treatment.
Conclusions
Personal protective equipment protocol supervised by wardens through a video monitoring process can be used as an effective complement to conventional mutual supervision methods and can help health care workers avoid Ebola infection during treatment."

Methods
All 178 final year medical students (clinical clerks) at the University of Calgary, Class of 2014 were invited to complete an online, anonymous, cross-sectional survey. After completing each mandatory rotation, students were sent a link to the online survey. Students were asked to report days of illness and whether they attended clinical or educational activities while ill. Students were also asked about consequences of missed days and reasons for attending while ill.
Results
Out of a possible 1,068 surveys, 549 surveys were returned, reflecting a 51% response rate. Overall, 37.0% ± 11.8% of the respondents reported attending while experiencing symptoms suggestive of a contagious illness. Overall, the odds of presenteeism (ie, attending while ill/absent while ill) for all clerkship rotations were 4.92. The most frequent reasons (56%) were concerns regarding evaluation or the impact that missing time from the rotation would have on their learning.
Conclusions
Sickness presenteeism is common among medical students. Relevant factors may be different for students than other health care workers. Medical educators should be aware of these factors when developing policies to help promote professionalism and patient safety."

Extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (XDRAB) is a great threat in intensive care units (ICUs). The aim of this study was to describe an XDRAB outbreak which was cross-transmitted in the ICU and respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) in a tertiary care hospital from January-March 2013.
Methods
Patient and environmental surveillances were performed. Isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. Genotypes were analyzed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). A series of enhanced strategies were implemented to control the outbreak.
Results
A total of 11 patients were infected by XDRAB strains during this outbreak. Three patients in the ICU were found positive for XDRAB at the onset of the outbreak. Thereafter, infections were detected in 6 patients in the RICU, followed by reappearance of this strain in the ICU in 2 patients. All A baumannii strains isolated from patients and the environment were extensively drug resistant. MLST revealed them as ST368. After 3 rounds of environmental screening and cleaning, the laminar flow system connecting the ICU and RICU was found as the source of transmission. Successful control of this outbreak was achieved through multifaceted intervention measures.
Conclusions
This study suggested the importance of thorough surveillance and disinfection of the environment, including concealed devices, in preventing the transmission of an outbreak."

This is an observational cohort study of patients admitted to a tertiary care medical center from October 1, 2007-September 30, 2013, who underwent active screening for nasal colonization with MRSA.
Results
There were 29,371 patients who underwent screening for nasal MRSA colonization; 3,262 (11%) were colonized with MRSA. There were 32 cases of MRSA bacteremia among colonized patients, for an incidence of 1%. Thirteen cases of bacteremia occurred in non–MRSA-colonized patients, for an incidence of 0.05%. The odds of developing MRSA bacteremia for patients who were nasally colonized with MRSA compared with those who were not colonized were 19.89. There was no difference between colonized and noncolonized subjects with bacteremia in all-cause mortality at 30 days or 1 year.

Contaminated surfaces and colonization pressure are risk factors for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) colonization in intensive care units (ICUs). Whether these apply to modern units dedicated to the care of hematologic malignancies and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) procedures is unknown.
Methods
We reviewed the records of 780 consecutive admissions for acute leukemia, autologous HSCT, or allogeneic HSCT in which the patient was at risk for hospital-acquired VRE and underwent weekly surveillance. We also obtained staff and room cultures, observed staff behavior, and performed VRE molecular strain typing on selected isolates.
Results
The overall rate of VRE colonization was 11.4 cases/1,000 patient days. Cultures of room surfaces revealed VRE isolates in 10% of terminally cleaned rooms. A prior VRE-colonized room occupant did not increase risk, and paired isolates from 20 patients and prior occupants were indistinguishable on molecular typing in only 1 pair. VRE colonization pressure was significantly associated with acquisition. Cultures of unit personnel and shared equipment were negative except for weighing scales. Observation of unit clinical personnel showed high compliance for hand sanitation and but less so for gowns. Conversely, ancillary staff showed poor compliance.
Conclusions
Transmission of VRE from room surfaces seems to be an infrequent event. Encouraging adherence to surveillance, disinfection, and contact isolation protocols may decrease VRE colonization rates."

abstract = "Background
The role of anesthesia providers in dispersing potentially pathogenic material from one patient to another during intraoperative care needs further study. In this study we aimed (1) to quantify the dispersion of a surrogate pathogen from a simulated patient's mouth to the anesthesia workstation during routine anesthetic induction, (2) to test the hypothesis that there would be fewer contamination sites by providers who used a double-gloving technique, and (3) to examine the effectiveness of between-case anesthesia apparatus disinfection.
Methods
Twenty subjects were randomized to a single pair of gloves group (group 1) or a double-gloved group (group 2) and completed a simulated general anesthesia induction, completing a standardized set of interventions. Dispersion of a surrogate pathogen dye placed in the oral cavity of the simulated patient was tracked by a blinded observer and photography. Standard cleaning of the workstation was performed, and residual dye was quantified. Group performance was plotted using regression analysis and rate of contamination compared using parametric statistics.
Results
Group 1 contaminated an average of 16.0 (SEM = 0.89) sites compared with group 2, who contaminated an average of 7.6 (SEM = 0.85). The cart drawers, gas flow dials, medication vials, and ventilator controls were significantly contaminated by group 1, but not by group 2 (P < .05 in all cases). There were similar rates of contamination in both groups for the airway equipment, breathing system, intravenous access ports, and the roll of tape used to secure the endotracheal tube. Once the airway management phase of the induction ended, new site contamination continued at a high rate in group 1 but not group 2.
Conclusions
A double-gloving technique was associated with less spread of an oral inoculum to the workstation but was not uniformly protective. Between-case cleaning was ineffective in removing the contaminant, indicating that biologic material from one patient may be present when subsequent patients are cared for. This suggests risks for the current patient (eg, skin or oral site transfer to an intravenous site) and also may place future patients at risk. Importantly, using models that simulate actual clinical events can inform clinical practice and decipher challenging areas of ergonomics."

In September 2014, wound clinic A reported a cluster of group A Streptococcus (GAS) infections to public health authorities. Although clinic providers were individually licensed, the clinic, affiliated with hospital A, was not licensed or subject to regulation. We investigated to identify cases, determine risk factors, and implement control measures.
Methods
A case was defined as GAS isolation from a wound or blood specimen during March 28-November 19, 2014, from a patient treated at wound clinic A or by a wound clinic A provider within the previous 7 days. All wound clinic A staff were screened for GAS carriage. Wound care procedures were assessed for adherence to infection control principles and possible GAS transmission routes.
Results
We identified 16 patients with 19 unique infections: 9 (56%) patients required hospitalization, and 7 (44%) required surgical debridement procedures. One patient died. Six (37%) patients received negative pressure wound therapy at GAS onset. Staff self-screening found no GAS carriers. Breaches in infection control and poor wound care practices were widespread.
Conclusions
This GAS outbreak was associated with a wound care clinic not subject to state or federal regulation. Lapses in infection control practices and inadequate oversight contributed to the outbreak."

Hospital-acquired conditions (HACs) can increase the financial liabilities faced by patients when the HACs require additional treatment both in the hospital and in subsequent health care encounters. This article estimates incremental effects of 6 HACs on Medicare beneficiary financial liabilities.
Methods
Descriptive and multivariate analyses were used to examine the differences in beneficiary liability between care episodes with and without HACs. Episodes included the index hospitalization in which the HAC occurred and all inpatient, outpatient, and physician claims within 90 days of index hospital discharge. Medicare fee-for-service patients discharged from a hospital in fiscal year (FY) 2009 or FY 2010 with severe pressure ulcer, fracture, catheter-associated urinary tract infection, vascular catheter-associated infection, surgical site infection, or deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism after certain orthopedic procedures were matched by diagnosis, sex, race, and age to with patients without HACs.
Results
Medicare patients were liable for an additional $20.5 million per year across the HAC episodes compared with what they would have owed without the HACs. Beneficiaries with HACs were also more likely to exhaust their Part A days in the index hospitalization.
Conclusions
HACs create significant financial burden for Medicare beneficiaries. The incremental financial liabilities are concentrated in the episode of care after the index hospitalization with the HAC. Policies and programs that reduce HAC incidence will improve Medicare beneficiaries' physical and financial health."

Data estimating the rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in critical patients in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries are very limited. The aim of this study was to estimate VAP rates in GCC hospitals and to compare rates with published reports of the U.S. National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) and International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC).
Methods
VAP rates and ventilator utilization between 2008 and 2013 were calculated from aggregate VAP surveillance data using NHSN methodology pooled from 6 hospitals in 3 GCC countries: Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Bahrain. The standardized infection ratios of VAP in GCC hospitals were compared with published reports of the NHSN and INICC.
Results
A total of 368 VAP events were diagnosed during a 6-year period covering 76,749 ventilator days and 134,994 patient days. The overall VAP rate was 4.8 per 1,000 ventilator days (95% confidence interval, 4.3-5.3), with an overall ventilator utilization of 0.57. The VAP rates showed a wide variability between different types of intensive care units (ICUs) and were decreasing over time. After adjusting for the differences in ICU type, the risk of VAP in GCC hospitals was 217% higher than NHSN hospitals and 69% lower than INICC hospitals.
Conclusions
The risk of VAP in ICU patients in GCC countries is higher than pooled U.S. VAP rates but lower than pooled rates from developing countries participating in the INICC."

Studies have consistently shown that copper alloyed surfaces decrease the burden of microorganisms in health care environments. This study assessed whether copper alloy surfaces decreased hospital-associated infections in pediatric intensive and intermediate care units.
Methods
Admitted infants were assigned sequentially to a room furnished with or without a limited number of copper alloyed surfaces. Clinical and exposure to intervention data were collected on a daily basis. To avoid counting infections present prior to admission, patients who stayed in the hospital <72 hours were excluded from analysis. Health care–associated infections (HAIs) were confirmed according to protocol definitions.
Results
Clinical outcomes from 515 patients were considered in our analysis: 261 patients from the intervention arm of the study, and 254 from the control arm. Crude analysis showed an HAI rate of 10.6 versus 13.0 per 1,000 patient days for copper- and non–copper-exposed patients, respectively, for a crude relative risk reduction (RRR) of 0.19 (90% confidence interval, 0.46 to -0.22). Conducting clinical trials to assess interventions that may impact HAI rates is very challenging. The results here contribute to our understanding and ability to estimate the effect size that copper alloy surfaces have on HAI acquisition.
Conclusions
Exposure of pediatric patients to copper-surfaced objects in the closed environment of the intensive care unit resulted in decreased HAI rates when compared with noncopper exposure; however, the RRR was not statistically significant. The clinical effect size warrants further consideration of this intervention as a component of a systems-based approach to control HAIs."

The purpose of this review was to understand whether adding antimicrobial agents to hand hygiene products could increase the health benefits of handwashing with plain soap (HWWS) in low-income settings.
Methods
A review of experimental studies comparing the effects of HWWS with antimicrobial soap and waterless hand sanitizer on health and hand contamination in naturalistic conditions was conducted. In addition, an analysis was completed of the evidence from laboratory studies examining the factors that may affect the impact of antimicrobial soap, taking into account the conditions in low-income settings.
Results
The review found no evidence for a superior effect of antimicrobial products compared with HWWS on disease incidence and limited evidence for an effect on hand contamination under naturalistic conditions. An analysis of the effectiveness of antimicrobial soap in laboratory settings suggested that it was only more effective than HWWS when handwashing frequency, duration, and product concentrations were above levels that could be expected in low-income settings.
Conclusions
The limited available evidence suggests that under naturalistic conditions, antimicrobial products are no more effective than HWWS in removing pathogens from hands. Without significant improvement in efficacy, antimicrobial products are unlikely to produce greater health gains than HWWS in low-income settings."

Health care–associated infections (HAIs) can be associated with increased health care costs. We examined extra length of hospital stay (LOS) and associated per diem costs attributable to HAIs in a large academic medical center.
Methods
Data for analysis were acquired in a preinterventional phase of a prospective cohort study (ALERTS) conducted over 12 months in 27 general and 4 intensive care units at Jena University Hospital. HAIs were identified among patients hospitalized for ≥48 hours with at least 1 risk factor for HAI and new antimicrobial therapy; the diagnosis was confirmed by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria. Extra LOS was estimated by multistate modeling, and associated extra costs were based on average per diem costs for clinical units sampled.
Results
Of a total of 22,613 patients hospitalized for ≥48 hours, 893 (3.95%) experienced 1,212 episodes of HAI during 12 months. The associated mean extra LOS ± SEM in general units was 8.45 ± 0.80 days per case and 8.09 ± 0.91 days for patients treated in both general and intensive care units. Additional costs attributable to HAIs were €5,823-€11,840 ($7,453-$15,155) per infected patient.
Conclusion
HAIs generated substantial extra costs by prolonging hospitalization. Potential clinical and financial savings may be realized by implementing effective infection prevention programs."

In this study we assessed the propensity of biocide exposure in the development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria.
Methods
Our protocol is based on reporting changes in established antimicrobial susceptibility profiles in biocides and antibiotics after during use exposure to a product. The during use exposure reflects worse conditions of product use during application. It differs from the term low concentration, which usually reflects a concentration below the minimal inhibitory concentration, but not necessarily a concentration that occurs in practice.
Results
Our results showed that exposure to triclosan (0.0004%) was associated with a high risk of developing resistance and cross-resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. This was not observed with exposure to chlorhexidine (0.00005%) or a hydrogen peroxide–based biocidal product (in during use conditions). Interestingly, exposure to a low concentration of hydrogen peroxide (0.001%) carried a risk of emerging resistance to antibiotics if the presence of the oxidizing agent was maintained. We observed a number of unstable clinical resistances to antibiotics after exposure to the cationic biocide and oxidizing agent, notably to tobramycin and ticarcillin–clavulanic acid.
Conclusions
Using a decision tree based on the change in antimicrobial susceptibility test results, we were able to provide information on the effect of biocide exposure on the development of bacterial resistance to antimicrobials. Such information should address the call from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Union Biocidal Products Regulation for manufacturers to provide information on antimicrobial resistance and cross-resistance in bacteria after the use of their product."

The objective of this study was to evaluate performance metrics and associated patient outcomes of an automated surveillance system, the blood Nosocomial Infection Marker (NIM).
Methods
We reviewed records of 237 patients with and 36,927 patients without blood NIM using the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) definition for laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection (BSI) as the gold standard. We matched cases with noncases by propensity score and estimated attributable mortality and cost of NHSN-reportable central line–associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) and non–NHSN-reportable BSIs.
Results
For patients with central lines (CL), the blood NIM had 73.2% positive predictive value (PPV), 99.9% negative predictive value (NPV), 89.2% sensitivity, and 99.7% specificity. For all patients regardless of CL status, the blood NIM had 53.6% PPV, 99.9% NPV, 84.0% sensitivity, and 99.9% specificity. For CLABSI cases compared with noncases, mortality was 17.5% versus 9.4% (P = .098), and median charge was $143,935 (interquartile range [IQR], $89,794-$257,447) versus $115,267 (IQR, $74,937-$173,053) (P < .01). For non–NHSN-reportable BSI cases compared with noncases, mortality was 23.6% versus 6.7% (P < .0001), and median charge was $86,927 (IQR, $54,728-$156,669) versus $62,929 (IQR, $36,743-$115,693) (P < .0001).
Conclusions
The NIM is an effective screening tool for BSI. Both NHSN-reportable and nonreportable BSI cases were associated with increased mortality and cost."

Gram-negative bacillary (GNB) bloodstream infections account for 20%-30% of neonatal late-onset sepsis (LOS). We aimed to identify the incidence, clinical characteristics, and risk factors for adverse outcomes in neonates with GNB LOS.
Methods
All patients with GNB LOS admitted to the neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) of a university-affiliated teaching hospital in Taiwan from January 1, 2004-December 31, 2011, were enrolled. A case-control-control study was performed to evaluate risk factors for acquisition of neonatal GNB LOS.
Results
Of the 5,010 neonates, 290 (5.8%) had a total of 346 episodes of GNB LOS (36.7% of total LOS), with an incidence rate of 13.6 per 10,000 neonate hospital days. The overall mortality rate was 17.6% (51/290), and the sepsis attributable mortality rate was 9.8% (34/346 episodes). After multivariate logistic regression analysis, neonates with prolonged use of total parenteral nutrition (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-2.29; P = .041) were independently associated with acquisition of GNB LOS. The independent predictors of in-hospital mortality were Pseudomonas aeruginosa etiology (OR = 11.45; 95% CI, 2.83-46.24) and underlying secondary pulmonary hypertension (OR = 18.02; 95% CI, 3.28-98.89), renal disease (OR = 17.16; 95% CI, 2.96-99.38), and neuromuscular comorbidities (OR = 2.72; 95% CI, 1.06-7.00).

The emergence of bacterial resistance to β-lactam antibiotics seriously challenges the treatment of various nosocomial infections. This study was designed to investigate the presence of β-lactam–resistant bacteria (BLRB) in hospital air.
Methods
A total of 64 air samples were collected in 4 hospital wards. Detection of airborne bacteria was carried out using culture plates with and without β-lactams. BLRB isolates were screened for the presence of 5 common β-lactamase–encoding genes. Sequence analysis of predominant BLRB was also performed.
Results
The prevalence of BLRB ranged between 3% and 34%. Oxacillin-resistant bacteria had the highest prevalence, followed by ceftazidime- and cefazolin-resistant bacteria. The frequency of β-lactamase–encoding genes in isolated BLRB ranged between 0% and 47%, with the highest and lowest detection for OXA-23 and CTX-m-32, respectively. MecA had a relatively high frequency in surgery wards and operating theaters, whereas the frequency of blaTEM was higher in intensive care units and internal medicine wards. OXA-51 was detected in 4 wards. Acinetobacter spp, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Staphylococcus spp were the most predominant BLRB.
Conclusions
The results revealed that hospital air is a potential route of transmission of BLRB, such as Acinetobacter and Staphylococcus, 2 important causative agents of nosocomial infections. Therefore, improvement of control measures against the spreading of airborne bacteria in hospital environments is warranted."

Residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are at increased risk for colonization and development of infections with multidrug-resistant organisms. This study was undertaken to determine prevalence of asymptomatic rectal colonization with Clostridium difficile (and proportion of 027/NAP1/BI ribotype) or carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) in an LTCF population.
Methods
Active surveillance was performed for C difficile and CRE rectal colonization of 301 residents in a 320-bed (80-bed ventilator unit), hospital-affiliated LTCF with retrospective chart review for patient demographics and potential risk factors.
Results
Over 40% of patients had airway ventilation and received enteral feeding. One-third of these patients had prior C difficile–associated infection (CDI). Asymptomatic rectal colonization with C difficile occurred in 58 patients (19.3%, one-half with NAP1+), CRE occurred in 57 patients (18.9%), and both occurred in 17 patients (5.7%). Recent CDI was significantly associated with increased risk of C difficile ± CRE colonization. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed presence of tracheostomy collar to be significant for C difficile colonization, mechanical ventilation to be significant for CRE colonization, and prior CDI to be significant for both C difficile and CRE colonization.
Conclusions
The strong association of C difficile or CRE colonization with disruption of normal flora by mechanical ventilation, enteral feeds, and prior CDI carries important implications for infection control intervention in this population."

Factors that increase risk for development of HACDI have been identified. Objectives of this study were to develop a predictive screening tool to identify patients at risk for HACDI and implement a bundle of mitigation interventions.
Methods
A predictive screening tool was developed based on risk factors identified in the literature and validated by retrospective analysis of all HACDI cases occurring in critically ill patients during 2013. The tool was used to screen all patients admitted to an intensive care unit. Evidence-based interventions (bundle) were implemented for patients identified as being at high risk for HACDI. Effectiveness of the model was measured by reduction of HACDI rate during the intervention period compared with the preintervention period.
Results
During the 12-month intervention period 217 high-risk patients were identified as infected with Clostridium difficile. Sixty-two of these met exclusion criteria, resulting in a study population of 157 patients. During the preintervention phase, 10 cases of HACDI occurred (overall incidence rate, 14.7). During the 12-month study period, 2 cases of HACDI were identified (incidence rate, 3.12). The reduction was statistically significant.

abstract = "Background
Any approach promoting a culture of safety and the prevention of health care–associated infections (HCAIs) should involve all stakeholders, including by definition the patients themselves. This qualitative study explored the knowledge and attitudes of health care workers toward the concept of patient empowerment focused on improving infection control practices.
Methods
Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 29 staff from a large hospital in Sydney, Australia.
Results
There was virtually unanimous agreement among the participants that patients should be thought of as a stakeholder and should have a role in the prevention of HCAI. However, the degree of patient responsibility and level of system engagement varied. Although very few had previously been exposed to the concept of empowerment, they were accepting of the idea and were surprised that hospitals had not yet adopted the concept. However, they felt that a lack of support, busy workloads, and negative attitudes would be key barriers to the implementation of any empowerment programs.
Conclusion
Although the World Health Organization has recommended that patients have a role in encouraging hand hygiene as a means of preventing infection, patient engagement remains an underused method. By extending the concept of patient empowerment to a range of infection prevention opportunities, the positive impact of this intervention will not only extend to the patient but to the system itself."

To report the results of the International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC) multicenter study conducted in Mongolia from September 2013-March 2015.
Methods
A device-associated health care–associated infection prospective surveillance study in 3 adult intensive care units (ICUs) from 3 hospitals using the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) definitions and INICC methods.
Results
We documented 467 ICU patients for 2,133 bed days. The central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) rate was 19.7 per 1,000 central line days, the ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) rate was 43.7 per 1,000 mechanical ventilator days, and the catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) rate was 15.7 per 1,000 urinary catheter days; all of the rates are higher than the INICC rates (CLABSI: 4.9; VAP: 16.5; and CAUTI: 5.3) and CDC-NHSN rates (CLABSI: 0.8; VAP: 1.1; and CAUTI: 1.3). Device use ratios were also higher than the CDC-NHSN and INICC ratios, except for the mechanical ventilator device use ratio, which was lower than the INICC ratio. Resistance of Staphylococcus aureus to oxacillin was 100%. Extra length of stay was 15.1 days for patients with CLABSI, 7.8 days for patients with VAP, and 8.2 days for patients with CAUTI. Extra crude mortality in the ICUs was 18.6% for CLABSI, 17.1% for VAP, and 5.1% for CAUTI.
Conclusion
Device-associated health care–associated infection rates and most device use ratios in our Mongolian hospitals' ICUs are higher than the CDC-NSHN and INICC rates."

Urinary tract infections account for 8%-21% of health care–associated infections; of these, 80% are associated with the use of a urinary catheter.
Methods
A quasi-experimental study was conducted in 2 medical-surgical intensive care units (ICUs) with 48 beds and 3 step-down units (SDUs) with 95 beds in a private tertiary care hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The study had 3 phases over a 9-year period to determine the sustainability of a program for continuous reduction of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI).
Results
Over the 3 phases of the study, rates of CAUTI in the ICUs fell from 7.0 to 3.5 to 0.9 infections per 1,000 catheter days. In the SDUs, CAUTI rates decreased from 14.9 to 6.6 to 1.0 per 1,000 catheter days. Comparisons of CAUTI rates in the 3 study phases, both in the ICUs and SDUs, showed significant reductions both between the 3 periods and in all possible combinations of analysis phases (all P < .001).
Conclusions
These results suggest that it is possible to reduce CAUTI rates to near zero and sustain these rates, but it requires a multidisciplinary team with different strategies that require continuous monitoring."

The US National Healthcare Safety Network has provided a definition of mucosal barrier injury-associated, laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection (MBI-LCBI) to improve infection surveillance. To date there is little information about its influence in pediatric oncology centers in low- to middle-income countries.
Objectives
To determine the influence of the definition on the rate of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and compare the clinical characteristics of MBI versus non-MBI LCBI cases.
Methods
We retrospectively applied the National Healthcare Safety Network definition to all CLABSIs recorded at a pediatric oncology center in Tijuana, Mexico, from January 2011 through December 2014. CLABSI events were reclassified according to the MBI-LCBI definition. Clinical characteristics and outcomes of MBI and non-MBI CLABSIs were compared.
Results
Of 55 CLABSI events, 44% (24 out of 55) qualified as MBI-LCBIs; all were MBI-LCBI subcategory 1 (intestinal flora pathogens). After the number of MBI-LCBI cases was removed from the numerator, the CLABSI rate during the study period decreased from 5.72-3.22 infections per 1,000 central line days. Patients with MBI-LCBI were significantly younger than non-MBI-LCBI patients (P = .029) and had a significantly greater frequency of neutropenia (100% vs 39%; P = .001) and chemotherapy exposure (87% vs 58%; P = .020) and significantly longer median hospitalization (34 vs 23 days; P = .008).
Conclusion
A substantial proportion of CLABSI events at our pediatric cancer center met the MBI-LCBI criteria. Our results support separate monitoring and reporting of MBI and non-MBI-LCBIs in low- to middle-income countries to allow accurate detection and tracking of preventable (non-MBI) bloodstream infections."

abstract = "Background
To inform clinical guidance, public health efforts, and research directions, probiotic use in U.S. health care needs to be better understood. This work aimed to assess the prevalence of inpatient probiotic use in a sample of U.S. hospitals.
Methods
Probiotic use among patients discharged in 2012 was estimated using the MarketScan Hospital Drug Database. In addition, the annual trend in probiotic use (2006-2012) was assessed among a subset of hospitals.
Results
Among 145 hospitals with 1,976,167 discharges in 2012, probiotics were used in 51,723 (2.6%) of hospitalizations occurring in 139 (96%) hospitals. Patients receiving probiotics were 9 times more likely to receive antimicrobials (P < .0001) and 21 times more likely to have a Clostridium difficile infection diagnosis (P < .0001). The most common probiotic formulations were Saccharomyces boulardii (32% of patients receiving probiotics), Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus (30%), L acidophilus (28%), and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (11%). Probiotic use increased from 1.0% of 1,090,373 discharges in 2006 to 2.9% of 1,006,051 discharges in 2012 (P < .0001).
Conclusions
In this sample of U.S. hospitals, a sizable and growing number of inpatients received probiotics as part of their care despite inadequate evidence to support their use in this population. Additional research is needed to guide probiotic use in the hospital setting."

Health care–associated infections caused by antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are an emerging and increasingly important public health threat. However, there are very few studies that examine the relationships between antimicrobial resistance strategies and interventions and the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant and multidrug-resistant strains of Pseudomonas.
Methods
The membership of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology was invited to participate in a Web-based survey of U.S. acute care hospital infection preventionists.
Results
A final sample of 225 completed responses was analyzed using correlational techniques. Resistance to gentamicin (r = 0.17, P = .01), imipenem (r = 0.18, P = .02), ceftazidime (r = 0.20, P = .03), and ciprofloxacin (r = 0.15, P = .03) all showed significant direct associations with epidemiologic investigation using molecular testing. A significant inverse relationship was found between resistance to ceftazidime and effective efforts in the identification and isolation of infected patients (r = −0.18, P = .02).
Conclusions
The finding of significant direct relationships between antimicrobial resistance and epidemiologic investigations using molecular testing suggests that the increased burden of resistance is associated with molecular testing rather than the intervention driving down rates. Effective identification and isolation of infected patients appeared to be associated with lower resistance rates. Further research is needed to uncover causal relationships."

Acinetobacter baumannii is a gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen. Its ability to form biofilm and increasing resistance to antibiotic agents present challenges for infection control. A better understanding of the influence of biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance on environmental persistence of A baumannii in hospital settings is needed for more effective infection control.
Methods
A baumannii strains isolated from patients and the hospital environment were identified via Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (Bruker Daltonics, Bellerica, MA), repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction genotyped, and antibiotic resistance was determined using Vitek 2 (bioMérieux, Inc, Durham NC). Biofilm mass was quantified via microtiter plate method and desiccation tolerance determined up to 56 days.
Results
High biofilm forming, clinical, multidrug-resistant- (MDR) positive strains were 50% less likely to die of desiccation than low biofilm, non-MDR strains. In contrast, environmental, MDR-positive, low biofilm forming strains had a 2.7 times increase in risk of cell death due to desiccation compared with their MDR-negative counterparts. MDR-negative, high biofilm forming environmental strains had a 60% decrease in risk compared with their low biofilm forming counterparts.
Conclusion
The MDR-positive phenotype was deleterious for environmental strains and the high biofilm phenotype was critical for survival. This study provides evidence of the trade-off between antibiotic resistance and desiccation tolerance, driven by condition-dependent adaptation, and establishes rationale for research into the genetic basis of the variation in fitness cost between clinical and environmental isolates."

Results
The corresponding drug-resistant TB prevalence between the new and previously treated cases was significantly different in almost all of the economic regions. The Eastern coastal region is the most developed economic region with the lowest total drug-resistant TB prevalence (any drug resistance: 28%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 25%-32%; multidrug resistance: 9%; 95% CI, 8%-12%) and the lowest number of new cases (any drug resistance: 21%; 95% CI, 19%-23%; multidrug resistance: 4%; 95% CI, 3%-5%). The Northwest is the least developed area with the lowest drug-resistant TB prevalence for previously treated cases (any drug resistance: 45%; 95% CI, 36%-55%; multidrug resistance: 17%; 95% CI, 11%-26%). The prevalence (multidrug and first-line drug resistance) exhibited a downward trend from 1996-2014. The extensively drug-resistant prevalence in China was 3% (95% CI, 2%-5%) in this review.
Conclusions
Overall, the status of drug-resistant tuberculosis in China is notably grim and exhibits regional epidemiologic characteristics. We are in urgent need of several comprehensive and effective control efforts to reverse this situation."

Worldwide, Legionella spp are a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia. Potable water systems are a main reservoir; however, exposure in the community is unknown.
Methods
Water samples from 718 buildings in Germany were collected. Possible risk factors were prospectively recorded. All samples were tested for Legionella spp using cultural microbiologic methods. Samples were assigned to 1 of 5 levels of contamination. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the influence of risk factors for contamination and, in a subgroup of buildings, for unsuccessful thermal disinfection.
Results
In total, 4,482 water samples from 718 different water supply systems were analyzed. In 233 buildings (32.7%), Legionella spp were identified, 148 (63.5%) of which had a medium or higher level of contamination. The most common species was Legionella pneumophila (94%). Contamination was strongly associated with temperature in the circulation, but not with the size of the building, time of the year, or transport time to the laboratory. Thermal disinfection was successful in fewer than half of the buildings.
Conclusions
There is relevant exposure to Legionella spp in the community. Water systems are not always up to current technical standards. Although microbiological risk assessment remains a challenge, there is a case for monitoring for Legionella spp outside of hospitals."

Hospital visitors' hand hygiene (HH) is an important aspect of preventing health care-associated infections, but little is known about visitors' use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers (AHS). The study aim was to examine if use of AHS is influenced by visitor characteristics and the location of AHS within the lobby of a large hospital.
Methods
An observational study was conducted with AHS placed in 3 different locations. The data included visitor characteristics and if AHS were used.
Results
The results suggest that visitors are 5.28 times (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.68-7.82) more likely to use AHS when dispensers are located in the middle of the lobby with limited landmarks or barriers, 1.35 times more likely to use the AHS in the afternoon compared with the morning, or when they are younger visitors (adjusted odds ratio, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.09-1.97). Individuals in a group are more likely (adjusted odds ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.06-1.84) to use AHS.
Discussion
In addition to location, time of day, and age, there is a group effect that results in visitors being more likely to use AHS when in a group. The increased use related to groups may serve as a mechanism to encourage visitor HH.
Conclusions
The results suggest future research opportunities to investigate the effect of group dynamics and social pressure on visitor AHS use and to identify strategies for improving visitor HH."

B-IC include standard and transmission-based precautions. A-IC are initiatives implemented within our center to enhance effectiveness of B-IC.
Objective
Study effectiveness of combining B-IC and A-IC to prevent transmission of MERS-CoV to HCWs.
Methods
A retrospective observational study was undertaken. A-IC measures include administrative support with daily rounds; infection control risk assessment; timely screening, isolation, and specimen analysis; collaboration; epidemic planning; stockpiling; implementation of contingency plans; full personal protective equipment use for advanced airway management; use of a real-time electronic isolation flagging system; infection prevention and control team on-call protocols; pretransfer MERS-CoV testing; and education.
Results
A total of 874 real-time polymerase chain reaction MERS-CoV tests were performed during the period beginning July 1, 2013, and ending January 31, 2015. Six hundred ninety-four non-HCWs were tested, of these 16 tested positive for MERS-CoV and their infection was community acquired. Sixty-nine percent of the confirmed MERS-CoV-positive cases were men, with an average age of 56 years (range, 19-84 years). Of the total tested for MERS-CoV, 180 individuals were HCWs with zero positivity.
Conclusions
Adhering to a combination of B-IC and A-IC reduces the risk of MERS-CoV transmission to HCWs."

Standard reporting of CLIP compliance, which measures compliance per CLIP form received, artificially inflated CLIP compliance relative to compliance measured using CVC placements as the denominator; for example, 99% per CLIP form versus 55% per CVC placement. This system established a higher threshold for CLIP compliance using this denominator. Identification of CVCs increased 35%, resulting in a decrease in CLABSI rates. The system also facilitated full compliance with daily documentation of line necessity.
Conclusions
Integrated electronic health records systems can help realize the full benefit of CLABSI prevention strategies by promoting, tracking, and raising the standard for best practices behavior."

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a frequent hospital acquired infections among intensive care unit patients. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement has suggested a “care bundle” approach for the prevention of VAP. This report describes the effects of implementing this strategy on VAP rates.
Methods
All mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the intensive care unit between 2008 and 2013 were prospectively followed for VAP development according to the National Healthcare Safety Network criteria. In 2011, a 7-element care bundle was implemented, including head-of-bed elevation 30°-45°, daily sedation vacation and assessment for extubation, peptic ulcer disease prophylaxis, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, oral care with chlorhexidine, endotracheal intubation with in-line suction and subglottic suctioning, and maintenance of endotracheal tube cuff pressure at 20-30 mmHg. The bundle compliance and VAP rates were then followed.
Results
A total of 3665 patients received mechanical ventilation, and there were 9445 monitored observations for bundle compliance. The total bundle compliance before and after initiation of the VAP team was 90.7% and 94.2%, respectively (P < .001). The number of VAP episodes decreased from 144 during 2008-2010 to only 14 during 2011-2013 (P < .0001). The rate of VAP decreased from 8.6 per 1000 ventilator-days to 2.0 per 1000 ventilator-days (P < .0001) after implementation of the care bundle.
Conclusions
This study suggests that systematic implementation of a multidisciplinary team approach can reduce the incidence of VAP. Further sustained improvement requires persistent vigilant inspections."

To investigate the risk factors and prognoses of patients with invasive Candida albicans and non–albicans Candida (NAC) infection in intensive care units (ICUs) in China.
Methods
Between November 2009 and April 2011, we performed a prospective study of critically ill patients with invasive Candida infection from 67 ICUs across China to compare the risk factors and mortality between patients with C albicans and NAC infection.
Results
There were 306 patients with proven invasive Candida; 244 cases (a total 389 Candida isolates) were sent to laboratory for strain identification (C albicans, 40.1%; NAC, 59.9%). More patients admitted for surgery or trauma had NAC infection than C albicans infection. C albicans infection was more common in patients with subclavian vein catheters or peritoneal drainage tubes. Compared with patients with C albicans infection, patients with NAC infection had longer antifungal therapy (P < .001), longer ICU (P = .004) or hospital stay (P = .002), and slightly higher mortality (38.4% vs 29.6%), but the difference was not significant (P = .17).
Conclusions
C albicans remains the most common pathogen in candidiasis in critical care patients. However, the number of NAC infections exceeded C albicans infections. Compared with patients with C albicans infection, patients with NAC infection had heavier disease burdens."

We investigated the overall and daily incidence of bacteremia among hospitalized patients and evaluated the traditional classification of bacteremia (community-onset vs nosocomial based on a 48-hour time window) by means of the daily incidence and associated 30-day mortality.
Methods
In a multicenter hospital-based cohort study, we included all patients aged 15 years or older admitted to hospitals in Funen County, Denmark, during 2000-2008, and identified all first bacteremias per admission. We calculated the overall incidence of bacteremia per 1,000 admissions and 10,000 bed-days, as well as the daily incidence of bacteremia per 10,000 bed-days and associated 30-day mortality.
Results
We included 724,339 admissions and 10,281 bacteremias for an overall incidence of 14.2 per 1,000 admissions and 23.6 per 10,000 bed-days. The daily incidence was highest on the first 2 days of admission followed by lower incidences that were constant beyond day 12, but varied according to patient and epidemiologic characteristics. Thirty-day mortality for patients with bacteremia was 18% on day 1, 21% on day 2, and between 25% and 35% thereafter.
Conclusions
Hospitalized patients were at the highest risk of bacteremia during the first 2 days followed by lower incidences that were constant beyond day 12. Thirty-day mortality was 18%-21% for patients with bacteremia on the first 2 days and 25%-35% thereafter. Our findings support the traditional classification of bacteremia."

abstract = "Background
The use of N95 respirators prevents spread of respiratory infectious agents, but leakage hampers its protection. Manufacturers recommend a user seal check to identify on-site gross leakage. However, no empirical evidence is provided. Therefore, this study aims to examine validity of a user seal check on gross leakage detection in commonly used types of N95 respirators.
Methods
A convenience sample of 638 nursing students was recruited. On the wearing of 3 different designs of N95 respirators, namely 3M-1860s, 3M-1862, and Kimberly-Clark 46827, the standardized user seal check procedure was carried out to identify gross leakage. Repeated testing of leakage was followed by the use of a quantitative fit testing (QNFT) device in performing normal breathing and deep breathing exercises. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios were calculated accordingly.
Results
As indicated by QNFT, prevalence of actual gross leakage was 31.0%-39.2% with the 3M respirators and 65.4%-65.8% with the Kimberly-Clark respirator. Sensitivity and specificity of the user seal check for identifying actual gross leakage were approximately 27.7% and 75.5% for 3M-1860s, 22.1% and 80.5% for 3M-1862, and 26.9% and 80.2% for Kimberly-Clark 46827, respectively. Likelihood ratios were close to 1 (range, 0.89-1.51) for all types of respirators.
Conclusions
The results did not support user seal checks in detecting any actual gross leakage in the donning of N95 respirators. However, such a check might alert health care workers that donning a tight-fitting respirator should be performed carefully."

To evaluate how critical nurses' knowledge of and adherence to current care hand hygiene (HH) guidelines differ between randomly allocated intervention and control groups before and after simulation education in both a simulation setting and clinical practice during a 2-year follow-up period. It was hypothesized that intervention group knowledge of and adherence to current HH guidelines might increase compared with a control group after simulation education.
Methods
A prospective, parallel, randomized controlled trial with repeated measurements was conducted in a 22-bed adult mixed medical-surgical intensive care unit in Oulu, Finland. Thirty out of 40 initially randomized critical care nurses participated in the baseline measurements; of these, 17 completed all the study procedures. Participants' HH adherence was observed only in high-risk contact situations prior to and postendotracheal suctioning events using a direct, nonparticipatory method of observation. Participants' HH knowledge was evaluated at the end of each observational session.
Results
The overall HH adherence increased from a baseline value of 40.8% to 50.8% in the final postintervention measurement at 24 months (P = .002). However, the linear mixed model did not identify any significant group (P = .77) or time-group interactions (P = .17) between the study groups after 2 years of simulation education. In addition, simulation education had no impact on participants' HH knowledge.
Conclusions
After a single simulation education session, critical care nurses' knowledge of and adherence to current HH guidelines remained below targeted behavior rates."

We describe the clinical characteristics and epidemiology of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) from the U.S. CF center with the highest MRSA prevalence.
Methods
Medical records of children with CF were retrospectively reviewed from 1997-2009. MRSA clinical isolates from 2007-2009 were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and pulsed field gel electrophoresis.
Results
The prevalence of MRSA was 1% in 1997 and 49% in 2009. Fifty-five children (26%) had persistent MRSA infection. Sixty-eight percent of MRSA isolates were hospital-associated (HA) MRSA, of which 52% were pulsed-field type USA 100. Ninety-three percent of HA MRSA isolates were clindamycin resistant. Twelve children acquired MRSA before 1 year of age, 83% of whom were hospitalized prior to acquisition of MRSA. Ten of 11 sibling pairs carried indistinguishable MRSA strains. Children with persistent MRSA were hospitalized more often (P = .01), required inhaled medications more frequently (P = .01), and had higher rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa coinfection (P < .001).
Conclusion
MRSA prevalence in children with CF is increasing, and most children are infected with HA MRSA. Exposure to health care facilities and gastrointestinal surgeries may facilitate early acquisition of MRSA. Siblings carry indistinguishable MRSA strains, indicating household transmission of MRSA. Children with persistent MRSA had worse pulmonary morbidity. Coinfection with MRSA and P aeruginosa is likely associated with further increased pulmonary morbidity."

Methods
This prospective, before-and-after interventional study was conducted in three 6-month phases: preintervention (phase 1), intervention (phase 2), and postintervention (phase 3). We observed IUC insertion technique, maintenance care, and removal/nonremoval practices; provided training on CAUTI prevention measures; evaluated professional knowledge; provided adherence feedback; determined the incidence of CAUTI, and calculating the UCU ratio.
Results
Between phases 1 and 3, CAUTI incidence fell from 11.42 to 4.40 cases/1000 catheter-days (P = .216), whereas the UCU ratio remained constant. The risk of CAUTI was 2.6-fold higher in phase 1 than in phase 3. Adherence to hand hygiene (before and after IUC insertion) improved significantly, as did adherence to attaching the IUC to the patient and maintenance care guidelines. The reasons for IUC use (including inappropriate reasons) did not differ significantly. Professional knowledge improved significantly after training.

Pneumocystis pneumonia is a severe opportunistic fungal infection. Outbreaks among renal transplant recipients have been reported in Europe and Japan, but never in North America.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective case–control study among adult renal transplant recipients at a Canadian center, using a 3:1 matching scheme. Ten cases and 30 controls were matched based on initial transplantation date, and all patients received prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 1 year posttransplantation.
Results
The median time between transplantation and infection was 10.2 years, and all patients survived. Compared with controls, case patients had statistically lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (29.3 mL/min vs 66.3 mL/min; P = .028) and lymphopenia (0.51 × 109/L vs 1.25 × 109/L; P = .002). Transmission mapping revealed significant overlap in the clinic and laboratory visits among case vs control patients (P = .0002). One hundred percent of patients (4 out of 4) successfully genotyped had the same strain of Pneumocystis jirovecii.
Conclusions
Our study demonstrated an outbreak of pneumocystis more than 10 years following initial transplantation, despite using recommended initial prophylaxis. We identified low estimated glomerular filtration rate and lymphopenia as risk factors for infection. Overlapping ambulatory care visits were identified as important potential sources of infection transmission, suggesting that institutions should re-evaluate policy and infrastructure strategies to interrupt transmission of respiratory pathogens."

Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) cause significant morbidity and mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) settings. We examined potential cost-effectiveness of active CRE surveillance at ICUs in a nonendemic region from the perspective of a Hong Kong health care provider.
Methods
A decision analytic model was designed to simulate outcomes of active CRE surveillance in ICUs. Outcome measures included CRE-associated direct medical cost, infection rate, mortality rate, quality-adjusted life year (QALY) loss, and incremental cost per QALY saved by active surveillance. Model inputs were derived from the literature. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the influence of uncertainty of model variables.
Results
In base-case analysis, the surveillance group was more costly ($1,260 vs $1,256) with lower CRE infection rate (5.670% vs 5.902%), CRE-associated mortality rate (2.139% vs 2.455%), and CRE-associated QALY loss (0.3335 vs 0.3827) than the control group. Incremental cost per QALY saved of active surveillance was $81 per QALY saved. One-way sensitivity analyses found base-case results to be robust to a variety of model inputs. In 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations, the surveillance group was the preferred option 99.98% of time.
Conclusions
Active CRE surveillance in ICUs appears to be highly cost-effective to reduce CRE infection rate, mortality rate, and QALY loss in a low CRE burden region."

Surgical site infection (SSI) is among the most frequent hospital-acquired infections occurring in surgical patients and leads to increased morbidity, mortality, and costs. We aimed to identify risk factors for SSI in patients undergoing surgical procedures, with a particular attention to the use of drains.
Methods
This study includes all patients undergoing abdominal surgical procedures in 2 surgical wards in a teaching hospital in central Italy. Collected data included patient's demographic and clinical characteristics, procedure characteristics, administration of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis, and microorganism isolated. The outcome of interest was SSI.
Findings
A total of 872 abdominal surgery procedures were surveyed during the study period. Drains were placed in 37.0% of cases. SSI rate was 6.4% globally and 13.6% among the patients with drains, versus 2.4% in those without a drain (P < .001). In 72.1% of cases antibiotic prophylaxis was administered. The logistic regression analysis (P < .001) shown insertion of a drain (odds ratio [OR], 5.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.63-10.08), prolonged surgery (OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.09-3.59), and American Society of Anesthesiologists score equal to 3 (OR, 6.13; 95% CI, 2.33-16.11) as independent risk factors for SSI, whereas antibiotic prophylaxis was protective (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29-0.99).
Conclusion
This study revealed surgical drains as a risk factor for SSI, pointing out the need of a clearer understanding of drain role in the dynamics of SSI occurrence, with the purpose of decreasing infection risk through targeted preventive interventions."

Composition and diversity of intestinal microbial communities (microbiota) are generally accepted as a risk factor for poor outcomes; however, we cannot yet use this information to prevent adverse outcomes.
Methods
Stool was collected from 8 long-term acute care hospital patients experiencing diarrhea and 2 fecal microbiota transplant donors; 16S rDNA V1-V2 hypervariable regions were sequenced. Composition and diversity of each sample were described. Stool was also tested for Clostridium difficile, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Associations between microbiota diversity and demographic and clinical characteristics, including antibiotic use, were analyzed.
Results
Antibiotic exposure and Charlson Comorbidity Index were inversely correlated with diversity (Spearman = -0.7). Two patients were positive for VRE; both had microbiomes dominated by Enterococcus faecium, accounting for 67%-84% of their microbiome.
Conclusions
Antibiotic exposure correlated with diversity; however, other environmental and host factors not easily obtainable in a clinical setting are also known to impact the microbiota. Therefore, direct measurement of microbiome disruption by sequencing, rather than reliance on surrogate markers, might be most predictive of adverse outcomes. If and when microbiome characterization becomes a standard diagnostic test, improving our understanding of microbiome dynamics will allow for interpretation of results to improve patient outcomes."

Our objective was to evaluate the impact of implementing the updated World Health Organization (WHO) multimodal HH guidelines on HH compliance and HAI in a tertiary hospital in Taiwan.
Methods
We conducted a before-and-after interventional study during 2010-2011. A multimodal HH promotion campaign was initiated. Key strategies included providing alcohol-based handrub dispensers at points of care, designing educational programs tailored to the needs of different health care workers, placement of general and individual reminders in the workplace, and establishment of evaluation and feedback for HH compliance and infection rates.
Results
Overall HH compliance increased from 62.3% to 73.3% after 1 year of intervention (P < .001). The rate of overall HAI decreased from 3.7% to 3.1% (P < .05), urinary tract infection rate decreased from 1.5% to 1.2% (P < .05), and respiratory tract infection rate decreased from 0.53% to 0.35% (P < .05). This campaign saved an estimated $940,000 and 3,564 admission patient days per year.

This descriptive study observed the effects of an education campaign, targeted to increase patients' self-initiated hand hygiene, and a hand hygiene ambassador-initiated directly observed hand hygiene program on patients' hand hygiene compliance in a university-affiliated hospital.
Results
The overall audited compliance of patients' self-initiated hand hygiene was only 37.5%, with a rate of 26.9% (112/416 episodes) before meals and medications, 27.5% (19/69 episodes) after using a urinal or bedpan, and 89.7% (87/97 episodes) after attending toilet facilities. Patients referred from a residential care home for older adults had significantly lower hand hygiene compliance (P = .007). Comparatively, the overall audited compliance of ambassador-initiated directly observed hand hygiene was 97.3% (428/440 episodes), which was significantly higher than patients' self-initiated hand hygiene via a patient education program (37.5%, 218/582 episodes, P < .001).
Conclusions
Directly observed hand hygiene can play an important role in improving compliance with hand hygiene by hospitalized patients."

abstract = "Background
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a risk for all hemodialysis patients. Over a 2-month period in 2013, there were 11 HCV seroconversions at a satellite hemodialysis unit in Vietnam. We report the epidemiologic investigation of the transmission mode in the absence of unavailable phylogenetic analysis.
Methods
The outbreak occurred during a 2-year dynamic cohort study. All patients were tested every 2 months, and staff was tested annually for hepatitis B virus surface antigen and HCV core antigen. Cases were tested for viral genotypes to examine the genetic relationship. Direct observation of the patient care environment was performed, and infection control policy was reviewed for potential breaches. Data obtained during the cohort study were used to assess lifestyle and treatment-related risk factors for the incidence of HCV infection.
Results
All patients reused dialyzers and shared hemodialysis machines. One reprocessing system was used to rinse used dialyzers. The preparation area for parenteral medication and clean supplies was adjacent to the blood sample handling area and storage of reused dialyzers. HCV transmission through a shared machine was the likely mode of transmission in 1 of the 11 cases. Indirect contact transmission was the likely mode of HCV transmission for the remaining 10 cases.
Conclusions
Sharing hemodialysis machines was not the main risk factor for the outbreak, which was most likely caused by environmental contamination associated with infection control breaches. The outbreak highlights the importance of providing dedicated dialyzer reprocessing systems and strict adherence to infection control precautions to prevent HCV cross-contamination."

Cesarean section is a surgical procedure the main complication of which is surgical site infection (SSI), which is related to maternal morbidity and mortality.
Objective
To evaluate active monitoring by telephone to identify infection and time of SSI report in postpartum women and associated risk factors.
Methods
We conducted a prospective observational study from 2013-2014, at a referral service for high-risk pregnancies. Surveillance was conducted via telephone at least 30 days after cesarean delivery. Incidence ratio and time of infection occurrence (days) was analyzed. Survival analysis was conducted to assess the temporal distribution of the development of infection.
Results
Of a total of 353 patients, 14 (4%) cases of SSI were reported, and 10 (7.4%) of the reported cases occurred within 15 days after cesarean and average time of infection was12.21 days. American Society of Anesthesiologists score was the only risk factor associated with SSI after cesarean section.
Conclusions
The prevalence of SSI after cesarean section via telephone is similar to several services with different methods of surveillance, considering it could be used by services with limited resources. Superficial incisional SSI was the most common type of infection, time of infection report was mainly before the 15th day postprocedure, and American Society of Anesthesiologists score of 2 or less was protective against SSI. Telephone calls can be a viable method to identify women with infection briefly after discharge, particularly at-risk patients."

Health care-associated infection outbreaks have occurred in outpatient settings due to lapses in infection prevention. However, little is known about the overall infection prevention status in outpatient environments.
Methods
A cross-sectional design was employed to assess infection prevention policies and practices at 15 outpatient sites across New Mexico in 2014 during a medical student outpatient rotation. A standardized infection prevention checklist was completed via staff interview; observations of injection safety practices and hand hygiene behavior were conducted. Aggregate data were analyzed using Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) and Stata (version 12.1, Stata Corp, College Station, TX) statistical software.
Results
Medical practice staff interviews reported a mean of 92.8% (median, 96.7%; range, 75.0%-98.9%) presence of recommended policies and practices. One hundred sixty-three injection safety observations were performed that revealed medication vial rubber septums were disinfected with alcohol 78.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 71.1%-84.7%) of the time before piercing. Three hundred thirty hand hygiene observations revealed 33.9% (95% CI, 28.8%-39.1%) use of alcohol-based handrub, 29.1% (95% CI, 24.2%-34.0%) use of soap and water, and 37.0% (95% CI, 31.8%-42.4%) use of no hand hygiene.

Our institution experienced an endemic situation with extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Acinetobacter baumannii in the intensive care units (ICUs). Here, we describe the long-term results of the implementation of a screening and cohorting policy and new cleaning techniques based on a procedure that we call the 1 room, 1 wipe approach.
Methods
We conducted a 4-year quasi-experimental study in the ICUs of an 800-bed teaching hospital. The main actions implemented were active surveillance of XDR A baumannii and cohorting of carriers and introducing new cleaning techniques intended to avoid sharing wipes between rooms.
Results
XDR A baumannii significantly decreased from 132 cases in 2011 to 8 cases in 2014 and from 10.78 cases per 1,000 patient days in 2011 to 0.69 cases per 1,000 patient days in 2014. Segmented regression analysis showed that after implementing the measures, the monthly rates presented a sustained negative slope, with a significant change of −0.623 (P = .002).
Conclusions
The prompt identification and isolation of patients and adequate environmental cleaning are effective measures for reducing XDR A baumannii in ICUs. The 1 wipe, 1 room approach should be considered a standard measure for cleaning hospital facilities to avoid cross-transmission as a result of reusable cleaning wipes."

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is among the most common type of health care–associated infection in the intensive care unit and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Existing VAP prevention intervention bundles vary widely on the interventions included and in the approaches used to develop these bundles. The objective of this study was to develop a new VAP prevention bundle using a systematic approach that elicits clinician perceptions on which interventions are most important and feasible to implement.
Methods
We identified potential interventions to include through a review of current guidelines and literature. We implemented a 2-step modified Delphi method to gain consensus on the final list of interventions. An interdisciplinary group of clinical experts participated in the Delphi process, which was guided by a technical expert panel.
Results
We identified 65 possible interventions. Through the Delphi method, we narrowed that list to 19 interventions that included 5 process and 14 structural measures.
Conclusions
We described a structured approach for developing a new VAP prevention bundle. Obtaining clinician input on what interventions to include increases the likelihood that providers will adhere to the bundle."

Any opening in a medical bed mattress cover may allow bodily fluids to enter the mattress, leading to contamination and potential nosocomial infection. This study's purpose was to assess permeability of crib mattress covers and measure bacterial growth within and on crib mattress surfaces.
Method
Mattresses were selected randomly from hospital inventory. Bonney's blue dye was applied over mattress covers to assess permeability. Mattress cover surface swabs were acquired from standardized locations. Samples of mattress foam were acquired under sterile conditions. All samples were collected with the Eswab and eMRSA systems (Copan Diagnostics Inc, Brescia, Italy). Total aerobic bacteria count and colony types were assessed. Results are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean, independent t tests and analysis of variance were used to analyze data, and significance was achieved with P < .05.
Results
All mattresses (n = 7) had Bonney's blue dye visible on underlying mattress foam. There were 77 samples and 44 had bacterial growth. Total bacterial count ranged from 0.2-11.6 CFU/cm2 with mean of 1.7 ± 0.38 CFU/cm2. There was no relative differences between mattress sample location and colony type. All samples were negative for Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S aureus.
Conclusions
Any crack in a mattress cover renders it permeable to fluid entering the mattress. Bacterial growth was present on mattress covers and within mattress foam. Mattresses support microbial viability from which nosocomial infection may occur."

The prevalence of diabetes has increased over the last 2 decades; however, the national incidence of diabetic foot infections (DFIs) in the United States is unknown. We sought to determine national trends in DFIs among hospitalized adults in the United States over 15 years.
Methods
This was a retrospective cohort study of the U.S. National Hospital Discharge Survey from 1996-2010. Adult patients with a principal diagnosis of foot infection and a secondary diagnosis of diabetes were identified using ICD-9-CM codes. Incidence was defined as DFI discharges per 100 diabetes discharges. Independent risk factors for DFI among diabetics were identified using multivariable logistic regression.
Results
These data represent 1,059,552 DFI discharges over the study period. The incidence of DFI decreased from 1996 (2.3 DFIs/100 diabetes discharges) to 2010 (1.1 DFI/100 diabetes discharges). The proportion of patients experiencing lower-extremity amputation declined from 33.2% in 1996 to 17.1% in 2010. Peripheral vascular disease (odds ratio [OR], 2.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.87-2.91), peripheral neuropathy (OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 2.60-2.64), and male sex (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.66-1.68) were the leading risk factors for DFI.

Two ultraviolet-C (UVC)–emitting devices were evaluated for effectiveness in reducing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and Clostridium difficile (CD).
Methods
Six surfaces in rooms previously occupied by patients with MRSA, VRE, or CD were cultured before and after cleaning and after UVC disinfection. In a parallel laboratory study, MRSA and VRE suspended in trypticase soy broth were inoculated onto stainless steel carriers in triplicate, placed in challenging room areas, subjected to UVC, and subcultured to detect growth.
Results
Sixty-one rooms and 360 surfaces were assessed. Before cleaning, MRSA was found in 34.4%, VRE was found in 29.5%, and CD was found in 31.8% of rooms. Cleaning reduced MRSA-, VRE-, and CD-contaminated rooms to 27.9%, 29.5%, and 22.7%, respectively (not statistically significant). UVC disinfection further reduced MRSA-, VRE-, and CD-contaminated rooms to 3.3% (P = .0003), 4.9% (P = .0003), and 0% (P = .0736), respectively. Surface colony counts (excluding floors) decreased from 88.0 to 19.6 colony forming units (CFU) (P < .0001) after manual cleaning; UVC disinfection further reduced it to 1.3 CFU (P = .0013). In a multivariable model of the carrier study, the odds of detecting growth in broth suspensions after UVC disinfection were 7 times higher with 1 machine (odds ratio, 6.96; 95% confidence interval, 3.79-13.4) for a given organism, surface, and concentration.
Conclusions
UVC devices are effective adjuncts to manual cleaning but vary in their ability to disinfect high concentrations of organisms in the presence of protein."

Nosocomial infections are common in intensive care units (ICUs), but the pattern of infections and the distribution of microorganisms vary. We studied the ICU-acquired infections and their effect on patient outcomes in our ICU.
Methods
Patients admitted to our ICU for >48 hours were studied prospectively over a year. Infections were diagnosed based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Antibiotics were administered based on culture and sensitivity. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were carried out to determine the factors associated with infection.
Results
One hundred ninety-eight patients were studied. The crude infection rate was 50% with ventilator-associated pneumonia (40%) and bloodstream infection (21%) being the most common. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most common microorganisms. More than 90% of patients received antibiotics, the most common being β lactam-β lactamase inhibitors, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and carbapenems. Thirty-five percent of staphylococci were methicillin-resistant, 50% of Enterococcus strains were vancomycin-resistant, and 68% of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex, 47% of Pseudomonas strains, and 35% of Klebsiella strains were multidrug-resistant. A longer duration of ventilation was associated with infection. The overall ICU mortality rate was 24% and was similar in patients with or without infection.

Participants responded to a series of statements relating to contact isolation, using a 5-point Likert scale. Responses were assessed for overall positivity or negativity and further compared according to floor type or designation.
Results
Of the patients, 48.7% responded to the survey; 70 caregivers also responded. Patient and caregiver responses were similar and were positive overall. Most respondents felt safer because of the use of contact isolation and because it prevented infections. A smaller majority of respondents also thought the policy was adequately explained to them and adhered to by staff.
Conclusions
In the largest collection of respondents surveyed to date about contact isolation and its impact on them, the policy was viewed positively, both by patients and caregivers. There is still room for improvement in the area of patient education regarding the use of contact isolation."

To assess how enhanced postdischarge telephone follow-up calls would improve case finding for surgical site infection (SSI) surveillance after cesarean section.
Methods
We conducted a prospective cohort study of all patients who delivered by cesarean section between April 22 and August 22, 2010. In addition to our routine surveillance, using clinical databases and electronic patient records, we also made follow-up calls to the patients at 7, 14, and 30 days postoperation. A standard questionnaire with questions about symptoms of SSI, health-seeking behaviors, and treatment received was administered. Descriptive statistics and univariate analysis were performed to assess the effect of the enhanced surveillance.
Results
One hundred ninety-three patients underwent cesarean section during this study period. Standard surveillance identified 14 infections with telephone follow-ups identifying an additional 5 infections. Using the call as a gold standard, the sensitivity of the standard methodology to capture SSI was 73.3%. The duration of the calls ranged from 1 to 5 minutes and were well received by the patients.
Conclusions
Results suggest that follow-up telephone calls to patients following cesarean section identifies 26.3% of the total SSIs. Enhanced surveillance can provide more informed data to enhance performance and avoid underestimation of rates."

Data on long-term effects of interventions in infection control are scarce. We aimed to evaluate the 8-year sustainability of a successful intervention to reduce urinary tract infections (UTIs) through restriction of urinary catheter (UC) use in an orthopedic surgical population.
Methods
Prospective UTI surveillance from November 2009-January 2010 was conducted to compare the results against the 2-year sustainability assessment performed in 2004. Semistructured staff interviews focused on UC indication, training, insertion techniques, and recall of the former intervention.
Results
A total of 336 consecutive patients were included (median age, 63 years; range, 16-95 years; 55% women). A UC was placed in 17.6% of patients (operating room [OR], 10.1%; postanesthesia care unit [PACU], 3.6%; surgical wards [SW], 3.9%) compared with 20.0% in 2004 (OR, 15.7%; PACU, 1.0%; SW, 3.7%). The incidence rate of UTI was 2.4 per 1,000 patient-days in 2010 versus 2.6 per 1,000 patient-days in 2004; adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.21-2.76; P = .67. The qualitative inquiry demonstrated poor recall of the intervention and knowledge of guidelines except in the OR, where we identified a champion leader.
Discussion
The intervention effect was sustained with regard to overall UTI rate and UC placement in the OR, but less in the PACU and SW.

abstract = "Background
Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) have emerged as important health care-associated pathogens. Colonization precedes infection but the risk of developing infection amongst those colonized with CRE is not clear.
Methods
We searched multiple databases for studies reporting rates of CRE-colonized patients subsequently developing infection.
Results
Ten studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria, including 1,806 patients used in our analysis. All studies were observational and conducted among adult inpatients. The cumulative rate of infection was 16.5% in our study. The most common site of infection was the lung, identified in half of patients, followed in decreasing frequency by urinary tract; primary bloodstream; and skin and soft tissue, including surgical sites. Colonization or infection by CRE prolonged stay and was associated with a 10% overall mortality in our analysis.
Conclusion
Our study results suggest an overall 16.5% risk of infection with CRE amongst patients colonized with CRE. Given the high mortality rate observed with CRE infection and the difficulty in treating these infections, research to investigate and develop strategies to eliminate the colonization state are needed."

The objective of this study is to determine the efficiency of an ethical method, based on a thought experiment in ethics, on hygiene rules compliance for dental health care team members.
Methods
This is a prospective study that assesses hygiene compliance in dental practice before and after a thought experiment in ethics, using 2 questionnaires. Participants included 130 clinician students in dentistry at Strasbourg University Hospital, France.
Results
The results emphasize a better implementation of hygiene rules after the thought experiment in ethics, when comparing the relative frequencies of completed hygiene items. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test shows significant differences between the first questionnaire and the second one after the thought experiment in ethics (P < .001).
Conclusions
This ethical method provides efficiency on hygiene rules compliance, which makes it beneficial to implement. However, far from being an absolute unit method, this thought experiment in ethics appears to be an original, supplemental, and complementary method."

To encourage handwashing, we analyzed the effect that a passive visual stimulus in the form of a picture of a set of eyes had on self-directed hand hygiene among health care staff.
Methods
This was a prospective, single-blind study using a repeated measure design. Four dispensers of alcohol foam located in positions identified as #1, #2, #3, and #4 were used to deliver a single uniform volume of alcohol foam in an automated fashion. Pictures of eyes were placed on dispensers #1 and #3 but not dispensers #2 and #4 for 1 time period. The visual stimulus was rotated with each study time period. At the end of each study period, the volumes dispensed were examined to determine if the visual stimulus had a statistically significant influence on the volume dispensed.
Results
There were a total of 6 time periods. The average volume dispensed in stations with eyes was 279 cc versus that in the stations without eyes, which was 246 cc, and this was a statistically significant difference (P = .009).
Conclusion
The correct visual stimuli may enhance compliance with hand hygiene in health care settings."

Despite evidence from overseas that certification and credentialing of infection control professionals (ICPs) is important to patient outcomes, there are no standardized requirements for the education and preparation of ICPs in Australia. A credentialing process (now managed by the Australasian College of Infection Prevention and Control) has been in existence since 2000; however, no evaluation has occurred.
Methods
A cross-sectional study design was used to identify the perceived barriers to credentialing and the characteristics of credentialed ICPs.
Results
There were 300 responses received; 45 (15%) of participants were credentialed. Noncredentialed ICPs identified barriers to credentialing as no employer requirement and no associated remuneration. Generally credentialed ICPs were more likely to hold higher degrees and have more infection control experience than their noncredentialed colleagues.
Conclusions
The credentialing process itself may assist in supporting ICP development by providing an opportunity for reflection and feedback from peer review. Further, the process may assist ICPs in being flexible and adaptable to the challenging and ever-changing environment that is infection control."

Microorganisms may contaminate hospital mattresses even after terminal cleaning. We investigated the recovery of resistant bacteria from the mattresses of patients under contact precautions at a university hospital.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional study. Samples were obtained from the surface of mattresses, spread on replicate organism detection and counting plates, and cultivated at 37°C for 48 hours. After collecting samples, we identified microorganisms and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using the Vitek 2 (bioMérieux SA, Marcy-l'Etoile, France) automation system.
Results
We evaluated 51 mattresses. A total of 26 had resistant bacteria on the surface; the predominant species were Acinetobacter baumannii (69.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.5%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.5%). The median length of hospital stay was 41 days; the bed occupancy for patients under contact precautions and the time at which the patient was diagnosed as a carrier of resistant bacteria was 18 days.
Conclusions
The phenotypic similarity of A baumannii in inpatient units (mattresses) suggests circulation of the same strain. These results highlight the importance of controlling the potential spread of microorganisms through hospital mattresses."

The purpose of this study was to develop an electronic search algorithm which reliably differentiates infectious and noninfectious ventilator-associated events (VAEs). This was a retrospective cohort study used to derive a predictive model. It took place at a tertiary care hospital campus.
Methods
Participants included all ventilated patients who met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Health Safety Network definitions for VAEs between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2013. There were 164 patients who experienced 185 VAEs in the study period.
Results
The most predictive variables were fever 2 days before VAE onset, oxygenation changes, and appearance of respiratory secretions. No other variable, including laboratory tests, radiologic findings, and vital sign values, reached statistical significance. A multivariate regression model was constructed, with 68% sensitivity and 75% specificity (receiver operator characteristic area under the curve [ROC-AUC], 0.83). This was modestly better than the clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS), which had sensitivity of 50%, specificity of 59%, and ROC-AUC of 0.60.
Conclusions
Although diagnosis of VAEs remains challenging, our data indicate that clinical signs and symptoms of a VAE may be present up to 2 days before they screen positive. Sputum, fever, and oxygenation requirements all were indicative, but aggregate models failed to create a sensitive and specific model for differentiation of VAEs. The existing clinical tool, the CPIS, is also insufficiently sensitive and specific. Further research is needed to create a clinically viable tool for differentiating VAE types at the bedside."

This study examined the effectiveness of commercially available disinfecting wipes and cosmetic wipes in disinfecting pulse oximeter sensors contaminated with pathogenic bacterial surrogates.
Methods
Surrogates of potential biological warfare agents and bacterial pathogens associated with hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) were spotted on test surfaces, with and without an artificial test soil (sebum), allowed to dry, and then cleaned with different commercially available cleaning and disinfecting wipes or sterile gauze soaked in water, bleach (diluted 1:10), or 70% isopropanol. The percentage of microbial survival and an analytical estimation of remaining test soil on devices were determined.
Results
Wipes containing sodium hypochlorite as the active ingredient and gauze soaked in bleach (1:10) were the most effective in removing both vegetative bacteria and spores. In the presence of selective disinfectants, sebum had a protective effect on vegetative bacteria, but not on spores.
Conclusions
The presence of sebum reduces the cleaning efficiency of some commercially available wipes for some select microbes. Various commercial wipes performed significantly better than the designated cleaning agent (70% isopropanol) in disinfecting the oximetry sensor. Cosmetic wipes were not more effective than the disinfecting wipes in removing sebum."

A troubling number of health care-acquired infection outbreaks and transmission events, some involving highly resistant microbial pathogens and resulting in serious patient outcomes, have been traced to reusable, high-level disinfected duodenoscopes in the United States. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requested a study be conducted to verify liquid chemical sterilization efficacy of SYSTEM 1E® Liquid Chemical Sterilant Processing System (STERIS Corporation, Mentor, OH) with varied duodenoscope designs under especially arduous conditions. Here, we describe the system's performance under worst case SYSTEM 1E® processing conditions.
Methods
The test protocol challenged the system's performance by running a fractional cycle to evaluate reduction of recoverable test spores from heavily contaminated endoscopes, including all channels and each distal tip, under worst case SYSTEM 1E® processing conditions.
Results
All devices were successfully liquid chemically sterilized, showing greater than a 6 log10 reduction of Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores at every inoculation site of each duodenoscope tested, in less than half the exposure time of the standard cycle.
Conclusions
The successful outcome of the additional efficacy testing reported here indicates that the SYSTEM 1E® is an effective low-temperature liquid chemical sterilization method for duodenoscopes and other critical and semicritical devices. It offers a fast, safe, convenient processing alternative while providing the assurance of a system expressly tested and cleared to achieve liquid chemical sterilization of specific validated duodenoscope models."

We aimed to determine the frequency of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) infection occurrence in previously VRE-colonized children in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and to identify associated risk factors.
Methods
Infection control nurses have performed prospective surveillance of health care–associated infections and rectal VRE carriage in PICUs from January 2010-December 2014. This database was reviewed to obtain information about VRE-colonized and subsequently infected patients. A case-control study was performed to identify risk factors associated with VRE infection development in previously VRE-colonized patients.
Results
Out of 1,134 patients admitted to the PICU, 108 (9.5%) were found to be colonized with VRE throughout the study period. Systemic VRE infections developed in 11 VRE-colonized patients (10.2%), and these included primary bloodstream infection (n = 6), urinary tract infection (n = 3), meningitis and bloodstream infection (n = 1), and meningitis (n = 1). Logistic regression analysis indicated long hospital stay (≥30 days) and glycopeptide use after detection of VRE colonization as risk factors for developing VRE infection in VRE-colonized patients (odds ratio [OR], 5.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-15.8; P = .017 and OR, 12.8; 95% CI, 1.9-26.6; P = .012, respectively).
Conclusions
VRE colonization has important consequences in pediatric critically ill patients. Strict infection control measures should be implemented to prevent VRE colonization and thereby VRE infections. Furthermore, irrational antibiotic use and particularly glycopeptide use in VRE-colonized patients should be restricted."

Direct observation of health care worker (HCW) hand hygiene (HH) remains the gold standard, but implementation is challenging. Our objective was to develop an accurate HH observation program using multiple HCW volunteers.
Methods
HH compliance was defined as correct HH performed before and after contact with a patient or a patient's environment. HCW volunteers from each unit at our children's hospital were trained by infection preventionists to covertly collect HH observations during routine care using an electronic tool. Questionnaires sent to observers in February and December 2014 recorded demographic characteristics, observation time, and scenarios assessing accuracy. HCWs were surveyed regarding their awareness that their HH behavior was being recorded.
Results
There were 146 HH observers. The majority of observers reported making 1-2 observations per shift (65%) and taking ≤10 minutes recording an observation (85%). Between January 2012 and December 2014 there were 22,484 HH observations (average, 622 per month), including nurses (46%), physicians (21%), and other HCWs (33%). Observers correctly recorded HH behavior more than 90% of the time in 5 of the 6 scenarios. Most HCWs (86%) were unaware they were being observed.
Conclusion
A direct observation program staffed by multiple HCW volunteers can inexpensively and accurately collect HCW HH data."

To determine the status of OE to infectious risks and use of PPE.
Methods
A convenience sample of 907 questionnaires (response rate, 88.5%) was collected from September 1, 2014, to January 31, 2015, in 5 metropolitan Korean cities.
Results
Respiratory diseases were significantly prevalent (44.5%) and influenza (29.5%) was the most frequently reported illness. An exposure report was only made in 19.5% of cases. The primary reason for OE report noncompletion was the complexity of the reporting process (23.9%). A total of 365 participants reported OE to body fluids and blood (40.2%) with needlestick injury being the most frequent OE type (17.6%). More than 5 years of job experience (47.8%) (P < .001) and region (city) (P = .003) significantly increased OE to body fluids and blood.

The influence of high body mass index (BMI) on mortality and infectious outcomes of patients following open gastrointestinal surgery was unclear. This meta-analysis aimed to resolve this controversy.
Methods
PubMed and EMBASE were searched by 2 researchers. High and normal BMIs were defined as ≥25 and 18.5-24.99, respectively. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to compare the pooled effect sizes. The primary outcome was mortality. The secondary outcome was infectious outcomes, including surgical site, pulmonary infections, and urinary tract infections.
Results
Eleven eligible articles with 51,307 patients total were included. Compared with normal BMIs, high BMIs did not increase the risk of mortality (OR, 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-1.06; P = .12).

The efficiency, effectiveness, and user satisfaction regarding this antibiotic app were tested in a pilot study.
Methods
The app was introduced into 2 lung wards of a local teaching hospital. During the 8-month pilot study, the 62 nurses of the wards had access to the app. Changes in user satisfaction regarding information support, safety attitudes, and ASP behavior were assessed with a questionnaire. At baseline, 28 nurses completed the (e-mail) questionnaire; after the study, 18 nurses participated. Scenario-based tests were done to assess app efficiency and effectiveness at baseline (n = 16) and in a randomized control (without the app, n = 17) and intervention condition (with the app, n = 17).
Results
Significant improvements were found regarding task support (P = .041), reliability (P = .004), unobtrusiveness (P = .000), relevance (P = .002), user friendliness (P = .000), speed, and hyperlinks (P = .001).

Most facilities (n = 21) had procedures for hand hygiene, but recommendations for handwashing events and duration varied greatly. Less than half (n = 11) had separate procedures devoted to HuNoV outbreak control. Fifteen required disinfection of bodily fluids. Seven had procedures for exclusion of sick staff during an outbreak. Both hand hygiene and bodily fluid cleanup procedures had low mean scores for readability. Mean Flesch Reading Ease and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level for both procedures were in the range of difficult to understand.
Conclusion
Most LTC policies and procedures were not consistent with CDC recommendations for HuNoV. Moreover, readability of all procedures is needed so LTC workers can easily understand and implement prevention and control procedures."

Vaccine-preventable diseases pose a significant risk to children in childcare. However, few regulations exist regarding childcare staff vaccination. This study aimed to assess support for a childcare agency staff mandatory vaccination policy.
Methods
Surveys were distributed to staff and parents at 23 St Louis, Mo, childcare agencies during fall 2014. Staff and parents' support for a mandatory vaccination and/or agency certification program were compared using χ2 tests. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted using a 2-level nested design and controlling for gender, race, age, and income to determine predictive models for support for a mandatory staff vaccination policy and/or agency certification program.
Results
Overall, 354 parents and staff participated (response rate, 32%). Most supported a mandatory staff vaccination policy (80.0%; n = 280) or agency certification program (81.2%; n = 285), and there were no differences between parents versus staff. Determinants of support for a mandatory policy included willingness to receive influenza vaccine annually, belief that vaccines are safe and effective, and support for the policy only if there were no costs.

Laryngoscope blades were analyzed, and the presence of blood, bodily fluids, and microorganisms was verified, indicating their potential as a source of cross contamination during clinical usage. The way in which the blades are cleaned and disinfected in daily practice may place the patient and health care team at risk. The aim of this study was to determine the bacterial and fungal load on this equipment.
Methods
Descriptive cross-sectional study. A total of 83 laryngoscope blades, ready for use, were analyzed for their bacterial and fungal load at 2 university hospitals.
Results
The microbiologic analysis revealed the presence of microorganisms in 76.2% of cases at institution 1 and 92.7% of cases at institution 2, with microbial loads >101 colony forming units in 31.2% and 44.7% of cases, respectively. At both institutions, potentially pathogenic microorganisms were found, including Candida sp, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Pantoea sp, Enterobacter gergoviae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis.
Conclusions
These results indicate that the use of laryngoscope blades at these 2 institutions present a potential risk. Based on these findings, action needs to be taken so a higher level of safety can be offered to patients and health care professionals who have direct contact with this equipment."

Recent spread of USA300 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to nursing homes has been of particular concern. We sought to predict the ultimate prevalence of USA300 and non-USA300 MRSA and to examine the influence of potential risk factors on MRSA acquisition in community nursing homes.
Methods
The data were collected during a longitudinal MRSA surveillance study that involved 449 residents in 6 community nursing homes in Wisconsin. The subjects were screened every 3 months for up to 1 year. Markov chain models were employed to predict strain-specific prevalence of MRSA at steady state, and to assess the influence of potential risk factors, including recent hospitalizations, invasive medical devices, and antibiotic exposure on MRSA acquisition rates and average duration of colonization.
Results
At steady state, 20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 15%-25%) of residents were predicted to remain colonized with non-USA300 and 4% (95% CI, 2%-7%) with USA300 MRSA. Residents who used antibiotics during the previous 3 months were twice more likely to acquire MRSA than those who did not (acquisition rates, 0.052; 95% CI, 0.038-0.075 and 0.025; 95% CI, 0.018-0.037, respectively).
Conclusions
Non-USA300 was predicted to remain the dominant MRSA strain in community nursing homes. The higher rate of MRSA acquisition among residents with recent antibiotic exposure suggests that antibiotic stewardship may reduce MRSA colonization in this setting."

Monitoring of performance indicators and implementation of a computerized decision support system (CDSS) have been suggested as effective measures to improve quality of care. We conducted this study to evaluate the effect of monitoring of surgical prophylactic antibiotics (SPAs) and the CDSS on the antimicrobial use and resistance rate of major nosocomial pathogens.
Methods
An interrupted time series with segmented regression analysis in 3 periods (preintervention, SPAs monitoring, and CDSS) was conducted in a tertiary care hospital. Immediate change and change in trends of antimicrobial use density, resistance rate of nosocomial pathogens, and cost of antibiotics in each intervention period were compared with those of the preintervention period.
Results
Compared with the preintervention period, the change in the slope of the total use of antibiotics was −8.71 defined daily dose (DDD) per 1,000 patient days per month (95% confidence interval [CI], −11.43 to −5.98; P < .01) in the SPAs monitoring period and −1.95 DDD per 1,000 patient days per month (95% CI, −2.93 to −0.96; P < .01) in the CDSS period. Use of third-generation cephalosporins and aminoglycosides showed change comparable with that of total antibiotics use, but use of vancomycin and carbapenem was unchanged in the CDSS period. Trends of the proportions of extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Escherichia coli, meropenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus have been reversed or decreased in slope in the CDSS period. Length of hospital stay also showed a negative change in slope in the CDSS period.
Conclusions
Monitoring of SPAs and implementation of the CDSS can be effective measures for antimicrobial stewardship."

Following a period (2009-2012) during which zero measles cases were reported, a measles outbreak occurred in 2013 in Bama County, Guangxi, China, that involved more than 100 children younger than age 8 months. We aimed to identify the pitfalls and risk factors while implementing the control measures.
Methods
An outbreak investigation and a case-control study was conducted among children younger than age 8 months. The serum specimens of the study subjects and their mothers were tested for measles immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G.
Results
The attack rate was 2.3/1,000 population. The median (interquartile range) age was 18.6 months (7.9-52.8 months). The coverage of 2-dose measles-containing vaccine was only 34%. The case-control study revealed 2 independent risk factors: low education level of main caregiver (odds ratio [OR], 2.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.31-6.22) and visiting a hospital 7-21 days before the date of symptoms onset (OR, 9.84; 95% CI, 4.27-22.67). The population attributable fraction of the latter was 52.8%. The mothers of the cases had nonsignificantly higher levels of immunoglobulin M and were significantly more likely to have protective levels of immunoglobulin G than those of the controls. This suggests a reactive rather than protective role of the antibody to the child's infection.
Conclusions
In a near-elimination but low measles-containing vaccine coverage community, supplementary immunization activities should be emphasized for children and women who are potential future mothers. The minimum age of measles-containing vaccine should be further reduced. Hospital measles transmission must also be strictly prevented."

Hospital nurses are frontline health care workers in controlling the spread of infectious diseases. It is not known if nurses working in negative pressure isolation wards (NPIWs) are better prepared than before to safely care for patients with common infectious diseases.
Methods
For this qualitative descriptive study, 10 nurses were interviewed in depth about their experiences caring for patients in an NPIW. Tape recordings were transcribed verbatim and analyzed by qualitative content analysis.
Results
The following 5 themes were identified: (1) complexity of patient care, (2) dissatisfaction with the quantity and quality of protective equipment, (3) shortage of nursing staff, (4) continued worries about being infected, and (5) sensitivity to self-protection. Our participants' anxiety and uncertainty about being infected in the NPIW were increased by the complexity of patients' health problems and organizational factors. To protect themselves against infection before and during patient care, participants also developed sensitivity to, concepts about, and strategies to improve self-protection.
Conclusions
NPIW administrators should pay more attention to nurses' concerns about improving the NPIW working environment, supply good quality protective equipment, and provide appropriate psychologic support and ongoing education to ensure that nurses feel safe while working. This ongoing education should refresh and update nurses' knowledge about disease transmission, therefore decreasing unnecessary anxiety based on misunderstandings about becoming infected."

Four different fomites and surfaces (ceramic floor, cotton fabric fragments and synthetic fibers, and eggcrate foam mattress) were contaminated with potential pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae), then submitted to influence of biological fluids (blood, urine, artificial saliva). The viability of strains was evaluated at 24 hours after contamination and then in intervals of 7 days, by the colony-forming unit count technique.
Results
S aureus presented viability (>70 days) in all conditions tested, E faecalis and K pneumoniae had decreased viability over time, and E coli did not exhibit a growth relationship with surfaces or fluids. Persistence and adaptability capacity of potential pathogens in fomites and surfaces exposed to the patient are important for guidance, planning, and outlining of protocols for microorganism dissemination control and prevention in the health care environment."

The World Health Organization describes that there are 5 moments during a health care encounter when hand hygiene should be performed. This research explores a number of explanatory hypotheses to inform future intervention development with regard to improving compliance with the fifth moment.
Methods
A sequential, mixed-methods study was conducted using nonparticipant observation and a survey with focus groups informing the development of the questionnaire. A total of 484 participants were observed and 410 returned a postobservation questionnaire; a response rate of 85%. Analysis explored the role of organizational culture, professional culture/practice, and individual-level variables in explaining compliance with the fifth moment.
Results
Ninety-three percent of participants performed hand hygiene following the fifth moment. Compliance varied between regions, but not by professional group. More than 65% indicated that the fifth moment was clearly defined, achievable, valuable, encouraged, and widely known. However, 60% suggested that it was repetitive. There was a positive relationship between the performance of hand hygiene following the fifth moment and the perception that it was widely known.
Conclusions
Interventions to improve compliance with the fifth moment should focus on promoting awareness of the fifth moment and how it should be implemented in practice. Mechanisms for raising awareness should include education and role modeling."

The effect of decolonization on the control of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) may differ depending on intensive care unit (ICU) settings and the prevalence of antiseptic resistance in MRSA.
Methods
This study was conducted in a 14-bed surgical ICU over a 40-month period. The baseline period featured active surveillance for MRSA and institution of contact precautions. MRSA decolonization via chlorhexidine baths and intranasal mupirocin was implemented during a subsequent 20-month intervention period. Pre–post and interrupted time series analysis were used to evaluate changes in the clinical incidence of hospital-acquired MRSA colonization or infection. MRSA isolates were tested for the presence of qacA/B genes and mupirocin resistance.
Results
In pre–post analysis, the clinical incidence of MRSA significantly decreased by 61.6% after implementation of decolonization (P < .001). Meanwhile, interrupted time series analysis showed decreases in both the level (β = −0.686; P = .210) and trend (β = −0.011; P = .819) of clinical MRSA incidence, but these changes were not statistically significant. Of 169 MRSA isolates, 64 (37.8%) carried the qacA/B genes, and 22 (13.0%) showed either low- (n = 20) or high-level (n = 2) resistance to mupirocin. Low-level mupirocin resistance significantly increased from 0%-19.4% during the study period.
Conclusion
Although decolonization using antiseptic agents was helpful to decrease hospital-acquired MRSA rates, the emergence of antiseptic resistance should be monitored."

Nursing home residents are a population at risk for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carriage, but few data about MRSA in this setting in Shanghai are available. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence and risk factors for MRSA carriage in nursing home residents in Shanghai, China.
Methods
Four hundred forty-three residents from 7 nursing homes in Shanghai, China, participated in this study; nasal and axillary swabs were obtained from these residents. Laboratory identification for S aureus and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed when isolated. Data, including individual resident characteristics and nursing home characteristics, were collected and analyzed.
Results
Of the 443 participating residents, 99 (22.3%) and 45 (10.2%) residents were colonized by S aureus and MRSA, respectively. Previous hospitalization (odds ratio [OR], 2.564; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.214-5.415; P = .014), presence of an invasive device (OR, 3.455; 95% CI, 1.678-7.113; P = .001), chloramphenicol therapy (OR, 7.672; 95% CI, 1.807-32.580; P = .006), and macrolides therapy (OR, 2.796; 95% CI, 1.056-7.403; P = .038) were independent risk factors for MRSA colonization. Low expenditure per month and less good sanitary condition also increased the risk for MRSA colonization.
Conclusions
Our study suggests that nursing homes are significant reservoirs for MRSA. Implementation of infection control strategies must be given high priority in nursing homes to fight the high prevalence of MRSA, and increased convenience and feasibility should also be realized with these control strategies for MRSA colonization."

Cesarean surgical site infections (SSIs) are a major challenge in Thai-Myanmar border hospital settings. This study aimed to examine risk factors for SSIs after cesarean section.
Methods
This was a prospective cohort study conducted in a Thai-Myanmar border hospital between January 2007 and December 2012. Data were collected from the medical record database by trained infection control nurses. Stepwise multivariable logistic regression was used for risk factor analysis and expressed as a risk ratio (RR).
Results
The cesarean SSI rate was 5.9% (293 SSIs in 4,988 cases). Of these, 17.1% were incisional SSIs (10.9% superficial and 6.2% deep incisional SSIs), and 82.9% were organ or space SSIs. Risk factors for cesarean organ-space SSIs included a wound class ≥3 (RR, 4.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.41-6.83), ethnic minority (RR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.61-3.92), hemoglobin <11 g/dL (RR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.57-3.04), pelvic examination before delivery on ≥5 occasions (RR, 4.16; 95% CI, 2.89-5.99), preterm (RR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.33-2.95), being a local referral (RR, 3.37; 95% CI, 2.29-4.97), and foul-smelling amniotic fluid (RR, 21.08; 95% CI, 10.23-43.41).
Conclusions
Most cesarean SSIs in this study seem to have a high severity. Their risk factors reflected delayed appropriate perinatal maternal care that resulted in late cesarean delivery. Early prenatal care may help reduce cesarean SSIs among this population."

Environmental risk factors for Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs) have been described at the room or unit level but not the hospital level. To understand the environmental risk factors for CDI, we investigated the association between institutional- and individual-level CDI.
Methods
We performed a retrospective cohort study using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project state inpatient databases for California (2005-2011). For each patient's hospital stay, we calculated the hospital CDI incidence rate corresponding to the patient's quarter of discharge, while excluding each patient's own CDI status. Adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, we ran a pooled logistic regression to determine individual CDI risk attributable to the hospital's CDI rate.
Results
There were 10,329,988 patients (26,086 cases and 10,303,902 noncases) who were analyzed. We found that a percentage point increase in the CDI incidence rate a patient encountered increased the odds of CDI by a factor of 1.182.
Conclusions
As a point of comparison, a 1-percentage point increase in the CDI incidence rate that the patient encountered had roughly the same impact on their odds of acquiring CDI as a 55.8-day increase in their length of stay or a 60-year increase in age. Patients treated in hospitals with a higher CDI rate are more likely to acquire CDI."

In China, several measures have been adopted to decrease unnecessary antimicrobial overuse since 2010. This study aimed to identify characteristics of antimicrobial use in Chinese hospitals after implementing these measures and to explore additional targets for future antimicrobial stewardship.
Methods
In 2012, point prevalence surveys conducted in Chinese hospitals included inpatients who were admitted for at least 24 hours. Details regarding infection, antimicrobial use, and bacterial cultures were recorded.
Results
A survey of 786,028 inpatients in 1,313 hospitals included prevalence of health care–associated (3.22%) and community-acquired infections (22.52%); antimicrobial use prevalence (AUP, 38.39%); bacterial culture rate (BCR, 40.16%); and proportions of administration of a single antimicrobial (75.33%), therapeutic (23.16%), prophylactic (11.99%), and therapeutic plus prophylactic (3.24%) AUP rates. Prophylactic AUP rates of hospitals with <300, 300-599, 600-899, and ≥900 beds were 14.23%, 12.45%, 11.45%, and 11.34%, respectively. However, BCRs increased with increasing hospital bed numbers. AUP rates for surgical patients with classes I, II, and III wounds were 45.19%, 68.18%, and 68.47%, respectively. Prophylactic AUP rates for surgical patients decreased with increasing hospital bed numbers. These indices varied among different hospital departments.

Methods
We carried out a qualitative interview study using semistructured questions relating to aspects of health pre-FMT, during FMT, and post-FMT periods with 17 participants. Inductive coding was used to identify core themes during the periods.
Results
Pre-FMT themes included physical (continuous diarrhea and weight loss), mental (depression, wanting to die, and fear), quality of life (unable to perform normal activities), social support, and financial (medication costs) factors. Provider resistance/limited awareness were barriers to FMT. Participants reached a tipping point, experiencing feelings of hopelessness, which led them to pursue FMT. During FMT, participants commented on lack of a so-called ick factor. During the posttreatment period, participants experienced symptom relief, but had residual fears. Patient activation was present during all phases, including information seeking and empowerment.
Conclusions
During the pre-FMT period, participants experienced extreme discomfort and encountered FMT barriers. Undergoing FMT was reported as easy but residual fear remained. There were displays of patient activation at all FMT time periods, including the seeking of FMT. Participants could have benefited from having undergone FMT sooner, demonstrating a need for improvement in provider education and health system barriers regarding FMT."

abstract = "Background
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate an antimicrobial stewardship intervention can reduce length of stay for patients admitted to hospital with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).
Methods
Starting April 1, 2013, consecutive adult patients with CAP admitted to an acute care community hospital in Barrie, Ontario, Canada, were eligible for enrollment until March 31, 2015. The antimicrobial stewardship intervention was a prospective audit and feedback recommendation implemented in a stepped-wedge design across 4 wards. The primary outcome was time to hospital discharge, and secondary outcomes included time to antibiotic discontinuation and a composite outcome of 30-day readmission or all-cause mortality. The intervention effect was estimated by survival (time to discharge and antibiotic discontinuation) and logistic (30-day readmission or all-cause mortality) regression analyses.
Results
Complete data were available for 763 patients. The primary outcome was observed in 196 (82%) control patients and 402 (77%) intervention patients. Length of stay was reduced by 11% (95% confidence interval [CI], −9% to 35%). Time to antibiotic discontinuation was shortened by 29% (95% CI, 10%-52%). Odds ratio for 30-day readmission or all-cause mortality was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.49-1.29).
Conclusions
A prospective audit and feedback intervention did not significantly reduce length of hospital stay in CAP patients despite reducing overall antibiotic utilization."

abstract = "Background
Exposure to blood and bodily fluids represents a significant occupational risk for nurses. The most effective means of preventing bloodborne pathogen transmission is through adherence to Standard Precautions (SP). Despite published guidelines on infection control and negative health consequences of noncompliance, significant issues remain around compliance with SP to protect nurses from bloodborne infectious diseases, including hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and HIV.
Methods
A descriptive correlational study was conducted that measured self-reported compliance with SP, knowledge of HCV, and perceived susceptibility and severity of HCV plus perceived benefits and barriers to SP use. Relationships between the variables were examined. Registered nurses (N = 231) working in ambulatory settings were surveyed.
Results
Fewer than one-fifth (17.4%) of respondents reported compliance with all 9 SP items. Mean score for correct responses to the HCV knowledge test was 81%. There was a significant relationship between susceptibility of HCV and compliance and between barriers to SP use and compliance.
Conclusions
This study explored reasons why nurses fail to adopt behaviors that protect them and used the Health Belief Model for the theoretical framework. It concentrated on SP and HCV because more than 5 million people in the United States and 200 million worldwide are infected with HCV, making it 1 of the greatest public health threats faced in this century. Understanding reasons for noncompliance will help determine a strategy for improving behavior and programs that target the aspects that were less than satisfactory to improve overall compliance. It is critical to examine factors that influence compliance to encourage those that will lead to total compliance and eliminate those that prevent it."

Good hand hygiene is the single most important strategy used to prevent health care–associated infections (HAIs); however, health care workers' (HCWs') hand hygiene compliance rates range between 25% and 51%. This study aims to determine if a multimodal strategy using the World Health Organization's (WHO's) My 5 Moments for Hand Hygiene methodology increases HCWs' compliance with handwashing and awareness of the importance of good hand hygiene in the prevention of HAIs.
Methods
A quasi-experimental, 1-group pre-post survey design was used to test awareness and knowledge. A simple interrupted time series methodology at baseline and 3 months was used to monitor hand hygiene compliance.
Results
Overall, HCWs' hand hygiene compliance increased from 51.3% to 98.6%, with an odds ratio of 71.10. The pre-post survey demonstrated HCWs were aware and knowledgeable of the importance of good hand hygiene. Eight postsurvey questions focusing on the strategies used to promote hand hygiene demonstrated statistical significance using a 1-sample t test, with P values ranging from .000-.024.
Conclusion
A multimodal approach using the WHO's My 5 Moments for Hand Hygiene does increase HCWs' hand hygiene compliance and awareness and knowledge of the importance of hand hygiene in the prevention of HAIs. Using this approach can produce a positive social change by reducing preventable disease and decreasing HAIs not only within a facility but also in the community."

The objective of this study was to determine student adherence to infection control policies at 1 dental school. A secondary objective was to determine the influence of Ebola virus disease (EVD)-related training on student infection control behaviors.
Methods
An instrument to assess and record infection control behaviors was developed to reflect Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines as well as current teaching. Third- and fourth-year dental students were observed during patient-care appointments and behaviors were recorded and analyzed. Behaviors observed before the EVD outbreak and subsequent mandatory in-service training were compared with behaviors observed after completion of the training.
Results
Use of personal protective equipment was nearly universal. Overall compliance with infection control parameters was 88%. However, only a minority of students demonstrated no breaches of protocol. Most violations involved improper mask use and improper glove use during the intraoperative phase of an appointment and failure to wash hands after removing gloves. There were no significant overall differences in observed behavior pre- and post-EVD training.
Conclusion
Overall compliance with recommendations was high but some areas showed room for improvement. Future training in infection control should focus on these areas. Training related to EVD had no influence on student behavior."

abstract = "Objective
To explore the risk-adjusted association between intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and in-hospital mortality.
Design
Retrospective observational study.
Setting
Forty-five-bed adult ICU.
Patients
All non-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ICU admissions between July 1, 2008, and April 30, 2014, requiring a central venous catheter (CVC), with a length of stay > 48 hours, were included.
Methods
Data were extracted from our infection prevention and ICU databases. A multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to identify independent risk factors for ICU-acquired CLABSI. The propensity toward developing CLABSI was then included in a logistic regression of in-hospital mortality.
Results
Six thousand three hundred fifty-three admissions were included. Forty-six cases of ICU-acquired CLABSI were identified. The overall CLABSI rate was 1.12 per 1,000 ICU CVC-days. Significant independent risk factors for ICU-acquired CLABSI included: double lumen catheter insertion (odds ratio [OR], 2.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-5.77), CVC exposure > 7 days (OR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.06-4.04), and CVC insertion before 2011 (OR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.22-3.97). ICU-acquired CLABSI was crudely associated with greater in-hospital mortality, although this was attenuated once the propensity to develop CLABSI was adjusted for (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.54-2.68).
Conclusions
A greater propensity toward ICU-acquired CLABSI was independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality, although line infection itself was not. The requirement for prolonged specialized central venous access appears to be a key risk factor for ICU-acquired CLABSI, and likely informs mortality as a marker of persistent organ dysfunction."

Multiple factors affect compliance with hand hygiene, including conspicuity of alcohol-gel dispensers. Previous studies have shown that flashing lights increase hand hygiene compliance; however, the durability of this effect has not been studied.
Methods
We affixed flashing lights to hand sanitizer dispensers for a total of 6 weeks. Regression analysis was used to compare compliance rates between the beginning and end of the intervention. Our secondary objective was to determine whether compliance rates in cold weather could be improved by adding a sign separated in time and space from the dispensers.
Results
Flashing lights improved hand hygiene compliance from 11.8% to 20.7%, and this effect was unchanged over the 6-week study period. Fully charged lights resulted in a greater compliance increase. A preemptive sign did not have a significant effect on hand hygiene rates nor did absolute temperatures.
Conclusions
Flashing lights are a simple, inexpensive way of improving hand hygiene. Brighter lights appear to have a greater effect; however, this must be balanced with annoyance in specific settings. Temperature did not have a significant effect; however, this may be because the relationship does not fit a linear model. Other interventions, such as signs, may need to be tailored specifically to individual hospital environments."

abstract = "Background
The screening of critically ill patients at high risk of vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) colonization, to detect and isolate colonized patients, is recommended to prevent and control the transmission of VRE. Screening asymptomatic carriers brings financial burden for institutions. In this study, we performed risk analysis for VRE colonization and determined the financial burden of screening in a middle-income country, Turkey.
Methods
We retrospectively analyzed the VRE surveillance data from a pediatric hospital between 2010 and 2014. A case-control study was conducted to identify the risk factors of colonization. Total cost of VRE screening and additional costs for a VRE colonized patient (including active surveillance cultures and contact isolation) were calculated.
Results
During the 4-year period, 6,372 patients were screened for perirectal VRE colonization. The rate of culture-positive specimens among all patients screened was 239 (3.75%). The rate of VRE infection was 0.04% (n = 3) among all patients screened. Length of hospital stay, malignancy, and being transferred from another institution were independently associated risk factors for colonization. Annual estimated costs for the laboratory were projected as $19,074 (76,295/4) for all patients screened. Cost of contact isolation for each patient colonized in a ward and an intensive care unit was $270 and $718, respectively.
Conclusions
In developing countries, institutions should identify their own high-risk patients; screening priorities should be based on prevalence of infection and hospital financial resources."

The incidence of health care-acquired infection (HAI) and the consequence for patients with HAI tend to vary from study to study. By including all patients, all medical specialties, and performing a follow-up analysis, this study contributes to previous findings in this research field.
Methods
Data from the Swedish National Point Prevalence Surveys of HAI 2010-2012 was merged with cost per patient data from the county Health Care Register (N = 6,823). Extended length of stay (LOS) and costs related to an HAI were adjusted for sex, age, intensive care unit use, and surgery.
Results
Patients with HAI (n = 732) had a larger proportion of readmissions compared with patients with no HAI (29.0% vs 16.5%). Of the total bed days, 9.3% was considered to be excess days attributed to the group of patients with an HAI. The excess LOS comprised 11.4% of the total costs (95% CI, 10.2-12.7). The 1-year overall mortality rate for patients with HAI in comparison to all other patients was 1.75 (95% CI, 1.45-2.11), all 5 of these differences were statistically significant (P < .001).
Conclusions
Even if not all outcomes for patients with an HAI can be explained by the HAI itself, the increase in inpatient days, readmissions, associated costs, and higher mortality rates are quite notable."

Infection is one of the most serious complications following surgical placement of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). Infection prevention efforts are necessary in reducing CIED infectious outcomes. These devices, however, are commonly inserted in higher risk patients, which may explain the ongoing risk of surgical site infection (SSI) in this population. The rates of CIED infection and utilization vary widely in the literature. The definitions of infection may also vary between clinical definitions and the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) criteria.
Methods
The primary objective of this study was to review patient data to identify risk factors for infection and readmission after CIED placement at an academic medical center. The secondary objectives were to compare the rates of SSI identified by NHSN criteria compared to that obtained by applying clinical infection definitions.
Results
The overall rate of infection (SSI) was 1.9%, which was identical in both the clinical definition and NHSN reported data. The 30 day readmission rate and the 90 day readmission rate were 12.7% and 25.6% respectively with the most readmissions related to the patients' underlying medical conditions. A lower ejection fraction (EF) was identified as an independent risk factor for readmission, inpatient procedures, smoking and device infection were also significantly associated with readmission after CIED insertion."

Health care–associated infections result in significant patient morbidity and mortality. Although cleaning can remove pathogens present on hospital surfaces, those surfaces may be inadequately cleaned or recontaminated within minutes. Because of copper’s inherent and continuous antimicrobial properties, copper surfaces offer a solution to complement cleaning. The objective of this study was to quantitatively assess the bacterial microbial burden coincident with an assessment of the ability of antimicrobial copper to limit the microbial burden associated with 3 surfaces in a pediatric intensive care unit.
Methods
A pragmatic trial was conducted enrolling 1,012 patients from 2 high acuity care units within a 249-bed tertiary care pediatric hospital over 12 months. The microbial burden was determined from 3 frequently encountered surfaces, regardless of room occupancy, twice monthly, from 16 rooms, 8 outfitted normally and 8 outfitted with antimicrobial copper.
Results
Copper surfaces were found to be equivalently antimicrobial in pediatric settings to activities reported for adult medical intensive care units. The log10 reduction to the microbial burden from antimicrobial copper surfaced bed rails was 1.996 (99%). Surprisingly, introduction of copper objects to 8 study rooms was found to suppress the microbial burden recovered from objects assessed in control rooms by log10 of 1.863 (73%).
Conclusion
Copper surfaces warrant serious consideration when contemplating the introduction of no-touch disinfection technologies for reducing burden to limit acquisition of HAIs."

The International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC) is an international, nonprofit, multicentric health care–associated infection (HAI) cohort surveillance network with a methodology based on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network (CDC-NHSN). The INICC was founded in 1998 to promote evidence-based infection control in limited-resource countries through the analysis of surveillance data collected by their affiliated hospitals. The INICC is comprised of >3,000-affiliated infection control professionals from 1,000 hospitals in 67 countries and is the only source of aggregate standardized international data on HAI epidemiology. Having published reports on device-associated (DA) HAI (HAI) and surgical site infections (SSIs) from 43 countries and several reports per individual country, the INICC showed DA HAI and SSI rates in limited-resources countries are 3-5 times higher than in high-income countries.
Methods
The INICC developed the INICC Multidimensional Approach (IMA) for HAI prevention with 6 components, bundles with 7-13 elements, and the INICC Surveillance Online System (ISOS) with 15 modules.
Resources
In this article the IMA, the ISOS for outcome surveillance of HAIs and process surveillance of bundles to prevent HAIs, and the use of surveillance data feedback are described.

The objectives of this study were to estimate the antiretroviral therapy (ART) rate and the proportion of women with adequate ART adherence (100%), and to identify the reasons for not initiating ART in HIV-infected pregnant women in China.
Methods
We searched MEDLINE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and Wanfang (Chinese) to identify research studies published from 1990-2015. Only descriptive epidemiologic studies were eligible for this study.
Results
A total of 58 eligible studies were included in this meta-analysis. The eligible articles were published from 2006-2015 and covered all Chinese provinces. The estimated ART rate in HIV-positive pregnant women was continually increased, and the mean estimated ART rate increased from 47.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22.4-71.8) in 2006 to 95.0% (95% CI, 93.2-96.0) in 2013. In the meta-regression model, study year, study region, and income level were statistically significantly associated with ART rate estimates. During the last 10 years, the pooled ART adherence proportions for all studies yielded an estimate of 76.7% (95% CI, 61.0-92.5) of patients with adequate ART adherence (100%). Emergency cesarean delivery (57.9%; 95% CI, 9.9-100) and not knowing their HIV-infection status before starting (45.7%; 95% CI, 24.4-67.0) account for the dominant reasons for not initiating ART.
Conclusions
The geographic variation in ART rate of HIV-infected pregnant women was significant in China, and >25% of pregnant women did not achieved optimal ART adherence. It is crucial to investigate specific barriers for lower ART rates in the high-income regions and to develop interventions to maintain the adequate ART adherence."

Management of pressure ulcers (PrUs) in patients with gunshot-spinal cord injuries (SCIs) presents unique medical and economic challenges for practitioners.
Methods
A retrospective chart review was conducted at 3 acute care hospitals in metropolitan Detroit for patients admitted with PrUs due to gunshot-SCIs between January 2004 and December 2008. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression was conducted to choose for the independent predictors of infected PrUs. Mean adjusted in-hospital costs per patient and per hospitalization were calculated and compared between infected and noninfected PrUs.
Results
The study cohort included 201 gunshot-SCI patients with PrUs contributing to 395 admissions, including readmissions, between 2004 and 2008. Seventy-six patients (38%) had infected PrUs at time of the index admission. Independent predictors of infected PrUs on index admission included Charlson Comorbidity Index ≥2 (odds ratio, 2.18, P = .026) and stage III/IV PrU (odds ratio, 4.82; P <.0001). During the study period, the cumulative median duration of hospitalization per patient was 12 days (interquartile range, 6-24 days), resulting in a mean adjusted cost of $19,969 ± $6639 per patient. The mean adjusted cost per hospitalization for patients with infected PrUs was significantly higher than that for patients with noninfected PrUs ($16,735 ± $8310 vs $12,356 ± $7007; P <.001).
Conclusions
A multidisciplinary approach including home-based rehabilitation programs and SCI wound clinics might help prevent PrUs and their complications and reduce associated costs."

abstract = "Background
The role of contaminated environments in the spread of hospital-associated infections has been well documented. This study reports the impact of a pulsed xenon ultraviolet no-touch disinfection system on infection rates in a community care facility.
Methods
This study was conducted in a community hospital in Southern Florida. Beginning November 2012, a pulsed xenon ultraviolet disinfection system was implemented as an adjunct to traditional cleaning methods on discharge of select rooms. The technology uses a xenon flashlamp to generate germicidal light that damages the DNA of organisms in the hospital environment. The device was implemented in the intensive care unit (ICU), with a goal of using the pulsed xenon ultraviolet system for disinfecting all discharges and transfers after standard cleaning and prior to occupation of the room by the next patient. For all non-ICU discharges and transfers, the pulsed xenon ultraviolet system was only used for Clostridium difficile rooms. Infection data were collected for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, C difficile, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE). The intervention period was compared with baseline using a 2-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
Results
In non-ICU areas, a significant reduction was found for C difficile. There was a nonsignificant decrease in VRE and a significant increase in methicillin-resistant S aureus. In the ICU, all infections were reduced, but only VRE was significant. This may be because of the increased role that environment plays in the transmission of this pathogen. Overall, there were 36 fewer infections in the whole facility and 16 fewer infections in the ICU during the intervention period than would have been expected based on baseline data.
Conclusion
Implementation of pulsed xenon ultraviolet disinfection is associated with significant decreases in facility-wide and ICU infection rates. These outcomes suggest that enhanced environmental disinfection plays a role in the risk mitigation of hospital-acquired infections."

abstract = "Background
Experts have recommended microbiologic surveillance by external reference laboratories for certain flexible endoscopes. There is currently insufficient evidence on the feasibility and utility of cultures. Researchers evaluated a preassembled toolkit for collecting and processing samples from endoscopes.
Methods
A pilot study was performed in a large academic medical center. A toolkit was used to aseptically sample biopsy ports and suction/biopsy channels of 5 gastroscopes, 5 colonoscopes, and 5 bronchoscopes after full reprocessing. Blinded specimens were packaged and transported on icepacks to a reference laboratory that used standard methodologies for microbial cultures.
Results
The laboratory detected bacteria in samples from 60% of patient-ready endoscopes, including gram-positive and gram-negative species. Viable microbes (<10 CFU) were recovered from 2 gastroscopes, 3 colonoscopes, and 4 bronchoscopes. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Delftia acidovorans were recovered from all 3 endoscope types. Subsequent environmental testing detected S maltophilia in the reprocessing rinse water.
Conclusions
A preassembled toolkit facilitated the aseptic collection of samples for culturing by a reference laboratory that detected viable microbes on fully reprocessed endoscopes. Speciation allowed identification of potential pathogens and a possible common contamination source, demonstrating that microbial cultures may have value even when colony counts are low."

To report the results of the International Infection Control Consortium (INICC) study conducted in Kuwait from November 2013-March 2015.
Methods
A device-associated health care–acquired infection (DA-HAI) prospective surveillance study in 7 adult, pediatric, and neonatal intensive care units (ICUs) using the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) definitions and INICC methods.
Results
We followed 3,732 adult and pediatric patients for 21,611 bed days and 671 neonatal patients for 4,515 bed days. In the medical-surgical ICUs, the central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) rate was 3.5 per 1,000 central line days, the ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) rate was 4.0 per 1,000 mechanical ventilator days, and the catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) rate was 3.3 per 1,000 urinary catheter days; all of them were lower than INICC rates (CLABSI: 4.9; VAP: 16.5; and CAUTI: 5.3) and higher than NHSN rates (CLABSI: 0.9; VAP: 1.1; and CAUTI: 1.2). Resistance of Staphylococcus aureus to oxacillin was 100%, resistance of Acinetobacter baumannii to imipenem and meropenem was 77.6%, and resistance of Klebsiella pneumoniae to imipenem and meropenem was 29.4%. Extra length of stay was 27.1 days for CLABSI, 22.2 days for VAP, and 19.2 days for CAUTI in adult and pediatric ICUs. Extra crude mortality was 19.9% for CLABSI, 30.9% for VAP, and 11.1% for CAUTI in adult and pediatric ICUs.
Conclusions
DA-HAI rates in our ICUs are higher than the CDC-NSHN rates and lower than the INICC international rates."

Methods
We performed a point prevalence survey to detect fecal carriage of gram-negative bacteria carrying carbapenem resistance genes or which were otherwise resistant to carbapenem antibiotics among 500 consecutive admissions from local nursing homes to 2 hospitals in Providence, Rhode Island. We performed a case-control study to identify risk factors associated with carriage of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE).
Results
There were 404 patients with 500 hospital admissions during which they had rectal swab samples cultured. Fecal carriage of any carbapenem-resistant or carbapenemase- producing gram-negative bacteria was found in 23 (4.6%) of the 500 hospital admissions, including 7 CRE (1.4%), 2 (0.4%) of which were Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (ie, blaKPC) producing (CPE) Citrobacter freundii, 1 of which was carbapenem susceptible by standard testing methods. Use of a gastrostomy tube was associated with CRE carriage (P = .04). We demonstrated fecal carriage of carbapenem-resistant or carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacteria in 4.6% of nursing home patients admitted to 2 acute care hospitals, but only 0.4% of such admissions were patients with fecal carriage of CPE.

There are very few prospective clinical studies on neonatal health care–associated infection (HAI) surveillance. HAI surveillance helps reduce not only mortality, but also morbidity, length of hospital stay, and health care costs.
Methods
This prospective clinical study covered a period of 12 months in a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). HAI rates were calculated using different denominators: number of patients hospitalized in the NICU, number of patient-days, and number of specific device-days.
Results
The HAI rate was 18%, and the incidence density was 17/1,000 patient-days. The most common HAI was bloodstream infection (n = 34; 50%). The most common pathogen was coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 54.9%) in gram-positive bacteria and in general. Methicillin resistance was 96.4% for CoNS. Klebsiella spp (13.7%) was the most common gram-negative bacteria. Extended-spectrum β-lactamase positivity was 14.3% for Klebsiella spp and 25% for Escherichia coli. HAI-related mortality was 0.3%.
Conclusions
NICUs should perform their own HAI surveillance with prospective clinical design. Attention paid to handwashing, disinfection and sanitizing, complying with the terms of asepsis, extending in-service training, increasing the number of medical staff, preventing frequent changes in health care staff positions, and improving physical environmental conditions in NICUs might eventually decrease HAI rates."

abstract = "Background
In the largest Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in history, nosocomial transmission of EVD increased spread of the disease. We report on 2 instances in Sierra Leone where patients unknowingly infected with EVD were admitted to a general hospital ward (1 pediatric ward and 1 maternity ward), exposing health care workers, caregivers, and other patients to EVD. Both patients died on the general wards, and were later confirmed as being infected with EVD. We initiated contact tracing and assessed risk factors for secondary infections to guide containment recommendations.
Methods
We reviewed medical records to establish the index patients' symptom onset. Health care workers, patients, and caregivers were interviewed to determine exposures and personal protective equipment (PPE) use. Contacts were monitored daily for EVD symptoms. Those who experienced EVD symptoms were isolated and tested.
Results
Eighty-two contacts were identified: 64 health care workers, 7 caregivers, 4 patients, 4 newborns, and 3 children of patients. Seven contacts became symptomatic and tested positive for EVD: 2 health care workers (1 nurse and 1 hospital cleaner), 2 caregivers, 2 newborns, and 1 patient. The infected nurse placed an intravenous catheter in the pediatric index patient with only short gloves PPE and the hospital cleaner cleaned the operating room of the maternity ward index patient wearing short gloves PPE. The maternity ward index patient's caregiver and newborn were exposed to her body fluids. The infected patient and her newborn shared the ward and latrine with the maternity ward index patient. Hospital staff members did not use adequate PPE. Caregivers were not offered PPE.
Conclusions
Delayed recognition of EVD and inadequate PPE likely led to exposures and secondary infections. Earlier recognition of EVD and adequate PPE might have reduced direct contact with body fluids. Limiting nonhealth-care worker contact, improving access to PPE, and enhancing screening methods for pregnant women, children, and inpatients may help decrease EVD transmission in general health care settings."

Results
Hand hygiene compliance was superior for nurses (83.5%) and moderate for medical doctors (45.2%). In general, fungal growth was unique; only 9 of 128 HCW samples and only 4 of 65 environmental samples yielded positive results. The genetic relatedness of yeasts from the same species was investigated by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) typing. RAPD profiles exhibited the potential for cross-transmission of yeasts.
Conclusion
In general, the fungal colonization and contamination rate was low, but a high level of hand hygiene compliance was lacking."

Methods
Retrospective study of patients admitted to an intensive care unit who received CHSS, RM, or standard catheters in femoral venous access.
Results
We diagnosed 18 CRBSIs in 245 patients with standard catheters in 2,061 days, zero CRBSI in 169 patients with CHSS-impregnated catheters in 1,489 days, and zero CRBSI in 227 patients with RM-impregnated catheters in 2,009 days. Patients with standard catheters compared with CHSS- and RM-impregnated catheters showed a higher rate of CRBSI (7.3%, 0%, and 0%, respectively; P < .001) and higher incidence density of CRBSI (8.7, 0, and 0 per 1,000 catheter days, respectively; P < .001). We found in the exact Poisson regression that standard catheters were associated with a higher CRBSI incidence than CHSS-impregnated catheters (P < .001) and RM-impregnated catheters (P < .001), controlling for catheter duration. We found in survival analysis that standard catheters were associated with a lower CRBSI-free time than CHSS-impregnated catheters (P < .001) and RM-impregnated catheters (P < .001).

Methods
This case-control study included patients aged ≥18 years admitted to Novant Health Forsyth Medical Center between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2013, with CRE infections (cases) or non-CRE infections (controls). Controls were matched to their corresponding resistant case (3:1) based on pathogen, place of likely acquisition, isolate source, year of admission, and level of care. A risk prediction model was developed using variables independently associated with CRE isolation. Sensitivities and specificities were obtained at various point cutoffs, and a determination of the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) was performed.
Results
A total of 164 subjects were included. Independent risk factors for CRE included recent antibiotic therapy, recent immunosuppression, and Charlson Comorbidity Index score ≥4. Adjusted odds ratios were 13.37 (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.16-61.19), 6.69 (95% CI, 1.85-29.65), and 3.30 (95% CI, 1.34-8.40), respectively. Diagnostic performance of various score cutoffs for the model indicated a score ≥5 correlated with the highest accuracy (79%). The ROC AUC was 0.83.

Contact precautions (CPs) are recommended to prevent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) transmission in institutions. Rising doubts about CP effectiveness and recognition of unintended consequences for patients have raised questions about the benefit. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and adverse outcomes associated with CPs for prevention of MRSA transmission.
Methods
We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for articles related to effectiveness and adverse outcomes of CPs in patients with MRSA. Criteria for inclusion included the following: articles conducted in the United States, articles performed in an acute care setting, articles that were not a case series or review, and those with standardized collection of data or inclusion of case and control groups. Results were summarized and examined for potential limitations. Recommendations were based on our findings.
Results
CPs reduced MRSA transmission in epidemic settings and in instances with high compliance, but a decrease in infection rates was not shown. Unintended consequences of CPs include decreased health care provider (HCP) time spent with patients, low HCP compliance, decreased perceptions of comfort from patients, and greater likelihood of patient complaints and negative psychologic implications.
Conclusion
In endemic settings, there are few data to support routine use of CPs to control the spread of MRSA. Education should be performed in hospitals to improve patients' perception of care and understanding of CPs when implemented and HCPs' adherence to good hand hygiene and standard precautions practices."

abstract = "Background
A major source of microbial colonization of short-term central venous catheters (CVC) is the patients' endogenous skin microorganisms located at the CVC insertion site. The aim of this study was to determine if a transparent film dressing incorporating a 2% (weight/weight) chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) gel decreases CVC and insertion site microbial colonization compared with a nonantimicrobial dressing in adult patients in critical care.
Methods
On CVC removal, samples for microbiological investigation were taken from both the skin surrounding the CVC insertion site and also from sutures securing the CVC. The sutures and intradermal and tip sections of the CVC were also collected for microbiological investigation. Microorganisms recovered from the samples were subsequently tested for susceptibility to CHG.
Results
There was a significant reduction in the number of microorganisms recovered from the CVC insertion site, suture site, sutures, and catheter surface in the CHG dressing group (n = 136) compared with the nonantimicrobial dressing group (n = 137). There was no significant difference in susceptibility to CHG between the microorganisms isolated from the CHG and standard dressing study patients.
Conclusion
A film dressing incorporating a CHG gel pad significantly reduced the number of microorganisms at the CVC insertion and suture sites with concomitant reduced catheter colonization."

The purpose of this study was to assess the 12-week cumulative incidence of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI) and identify risk factors for rCDI in patients that acquired index C difficile infection (CDI) while in the intensive care unit (ICU).
Methods
This retrospective single-center cohort study reviewed adult patients from 6 different ICUs who developed a CDI between February 2010 and September 2013.
Results
Out of 162 included ICU patients, 34 experienced rCDI. Risk of rCDI was higher in the ICU versus non-ICU group (21% vs 17%, P = .03). The incidence of rCDI was highest in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) at 43.8%. A multivariable logistic regression model was constructed and identified 5 significant risk factors for rCDI: previous CDI (odds ratio [OR], 8.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.90-34.02; P = .005), log10 ICU length of stay in days (OR, 3.67; 95% CI, 1.13-11.85; P = .03), acquisition of CDI in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) (OR, 5.35; 95% CI, 1.60-17.85; P = .006) or SICU (OR, 15.30; 95% CI, 4.09-57.23; P < .001), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR, 3.55; 95% CI, 1.41-8.94; P = .007).
Conclusion
ICU adults had a significantly higher 12-week incidence of rCDI than non-ICU patients. Risk factors for rCDI after acquisition of infection in an ICU include MICU and SICU patients, previous CDI, COPD, and length of stay."

Inconsistent compliance of health care workers with standard precautions has already been documented. The objective of this study was to develop a questionnaire to investigate the sociocognitive determinants of compliance with standard precautions based on the theory of planned behavior.
Methods
To construct the Standard Precautions Questionnaire (SPQ), items were selected using a systematic review of literature and semistructured interviews with 54 health care workers. Thirty-five items were selected for a draft questionnaire. These questionnaires were sent to 649 health care workers in 3 medical specialties (pediatrics, geriatrics, and intensive care) in a French University hospital. A total of 331 valid questionnaires were analyzed.
Results
Factor analysis yielded a final 7-factor solution with an explained variance of 66.51%, with 24 items. The 7 dimensions were the following: attitude toward standard precautions, social influence facilitating organization, exemplary behavior of colleagues, organizational constraints, individual constraints, and intention to perform standard precautions. Some differences were observed between medical specialties on attitude toward standard precautions, social influence, and individual constraints.
Conclusion
The SPQ met the conditions of reliability and validity in accordance with psychometric demands and could be used to evaluate attitudes and intention to perform standard precautions among medical and nursing staff."

Gowns are recommended to prevent transmission of infectious diseases in certain settings; however, laboratory and field studies have produced mixed results of their efficacy. PPE used in health care is regulated as either class I (low risk) or class II (intermediate risk) devices in the United States. Many organizations have published guidelines for the use of PPE, including isolation gowns, in health care settings. In addition, the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation published a guidance document on the selection of gowns and a classification standard on liquid barrier performance for both surgical and isolation gowns. However, there is currently no existing standard specific to isolation gowns that considers not only the barrier resistance but also a wide array of end user desired attributes. As a result, infection preventionists and purchasing agents face several difficulties in the selection process, and end users have limited or no information on the levels of protection provided by isolation gowns. Lack of knowledge about the performance of protective clothing used in health care became more apparent during the 2014 Ebola epidemic. This article reviews laboratory studies, regulations, guidelines and standards pertaining to isolation gowns, characterization problems, and other potential barriers of isolation gown selection and use."

Minimal structure is required for effective prevention of health care–associated infection (HAI). The objective of this study was to evaluate the structure for prevention of HAI in a sample of Brazilian hospitals.
Methods
This was a cross-sectional study from hospitals in 5 Brazilian regions (n = 153; total beds: 13,983) classified according to the number of beds; 11 university hospitals were used as reference for comparison. Trained nurses carried out the evaluation by using structured forms previously validated. The evaluation of conformity index (CI) included elements of structure of the Health Care–Associated Prevention and Control Committee (HAIPCC), hand hygiene, sterilization, and laboratory of microbiology.
Results
The median CI for the HAIPCC varied from 0.55-0.94 among hospital categories. Hospitals with >200 beds had the worst ratio of beds to sinks (3.9; P < .001). Regarding alcoholic product for handrubbing, the worst ratio of beds to dispensers was found in hospitals with <50 beds (6.4) compared with reference hospitals (3.3; P < .001). The CI for sterilization services showed huge variation ranging from 0.0-1.00. Reference hospitals were more likely to have their own laboratory of microbiology than other hospitals.
Conclusion
This study highlights the need for public health strategies aiming to improve the structure for HAI prevention in Brazilian hospitals."

Proper hand hygiene has been linked to lower susceptibility to infectious diseases in many types of communities, but it has not been well established on college campuses. This study investigated the hand hygiene statuses of college students and their occurrences in relation to infectious diseases, medical visits, and absence from classes or work. It also examined the effects of education on handwashing technique to improve hand hygiene.
Methods
College students enrolled at a university in Northwestern Ohio were recruited as study subjects. Microbial samples were collected 3 times from each of the 220 valid volunteers before washing their hands, after washing with their own procedures, and after washing with a procedure recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Each volunteer also answered a survey including questions on their health conditions, medical visits, and absence from classes or work.
Results
Hands of 57.7% volunteers were colonized by an uncountable number of microbial colonies, which were significantly linked to more occurrences to infectious diseases (P < .05), medical visits (P < .05), and arguably more absence from classes or work (P = .09). The handwashing procedure provided by the CDC significantly improved hand hygiene.
Conclusion
It is critical to promote education on proper handwashing in colleges, in grade schools, and at home to improve health and learning outcomes."

Ebola virus disease (EVD) is an infectious disease associated with a high fatality rate. Health care providers (HCPs) are frequently infected while treating patients with suspected or confirmed EVD. Knowledge of, attitudes toward, and practices of HCP toward EVD, especially in hot spots, is an essential element to control the disease.
Materials and methods
In this descriptive, cross-sectional, health facility–based study, 258 HCPs were interviewed in different health facilities in hot spots in the targeted states, including district and federal hospitals and health centers, using a self-administrated questionnaire.
Results
The majority of respondents were house officers (40.7%), followed by nurses (26.4%). The remaining respondents were registrars, medical officers, and allied health professionals. All participants had heard about EVD. There were significant differences in the knowledge of doctors and allied health care providers regarding modes of transmission and clinical manifestations. Some false information, such as airborne transmission (53.1%) and insect transmission (20.2%), was reported by respondents. The majority of respondents (81.3%) claimed that they would treat patients with suspected EVD while taking a safe approach, 83.5% said they would notify health authorities about cases of suspected EVD, and 91.1% reported not attending any training sessions about EVD.
Conclusion
The media plays an important role in increasing awareness about EVD. Regardless, however, researchers recommend more in-service training for HCPs to increase their knowledge about EVD."

abstract = "Background
Autochthonous infections with New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-1 (NDM-1)–producing Enterobacteriaceae have been reported in Singapore since 2011, but occurrences of nosocomial transmission have not. We report an outbreak of NDM-1–producing Enterobacter cloacae among adults admitted to an acute hospital's general ward.
Methods
On detecting the index case with a culture specimen positive for NDM-1–producing E cloacae, active case finding was conducted by screening all possible patient contacts. On-site ward assessment was performed, and electronic patient medical records were reviewed to conduct a case-control study to identify factors associated with colonization.
Results
Of 55 screened patient contacts, 3 further cases were detected, with isolates genetically related to the index case. None of these 4 cases was housed within the same cubicle. However, 3 were managed by the same medical team. Being managed by this team was positively associated with being a case (adjusted odds ratio = 15.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-270.27; P = .06) after adjusting for age, sex, Charlson comorbidity index score, and recent antibiotic use.
Conclusion
Our report suggests nosocomial transmission of NDM-1–producing E cloacae occurred via health care staff. Improvements in infection control measures, especially pertaining to staff hand hygiene practices and ward staffing, are needed to reduce the spread of highly resistant pathogens, such as NDM-1–producing Enterobacteriaceae."

Standard precautions (SPs) aim to reduce the risk of cross-transmission of microorganisms. The objectives of the present study were to assess institutional policies for SPs promotion, available resources for SPs implementation, and education of health care workers (HCWs) and their compliance with SPs.
Methods
A multisite mixed-methods audit was conducted in 2011. Self-assessment questionnaires were administered at institution, ward, and HCW levels in French health care facilities (HCFs). Results were given as percentage of objectives achieved (POA) or percentage of “never or sometimes,” “often,” and “always” responses for each question.
Results
A total of 1599 HCFs participated, including 14,968 wards and 203,840 HCWs. At an institutional level, the POA was 88%, covering SPs promotion (91%), procedures (99%), and SPs evaluation (63%). At the ward level, the POA was 94%, covering procedures (95%) and resources (93%). HCWs reported the best compliance for changing gloves between patients (94.5% “always”), and the worst compliance for the use of gloves for intramuscular injection and the use of eye protection in cases of blood exposure risk (34.5% and 24.4% of “always,” respectively).
Conclusions
A literature review found no other study of SPs that included such a large study group. These results led to SPs promotion actions at local and regional levels. Reinforcement of SPs observance will be prioritized in the next national program from the French Ministry of Health."

abstract = "Background
To determine if hot, humid ambient conditions impact filtering facepiece respirators' (FFRs') fit, and to evaluate differences in physiologic and subjective responses between N95 FFRs and P100 FFRs.
Methods
Twelve subjects had physiologic monitoring and subjective perceptions monitored over 1 hour of treadmill exercise (5.6 km/h) in an environmental chamber (35°C, relative humidity 50%) wearing an N95 FFR, P100 FFR, or no respirator. Respirator quantitative fit testing was done before and after exercise.
Results
There was no significant difference in pass rates for both FFRs on initial fit testing, but subjects who passed were more likely to fail the postexercise test with N95 FFRs (P = .01). Wearing FFRs increased the temperature of facial skin covered by the FFR (P = .009) and breathing discomfort (P = .002). No significant differences were noted in other measured variables (heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, transcutaneous carbon dioxide level, rectal temperature, global skin temperature, core temperature, and subjective perceptions) between controls and FFRs and between FFR models.
Conclusion
After 1 hour of exercise in hot, humid ambient conditions, P100 FFRs retained better fit than N95 FFRs, without additional physiologic or subjective impact. Wearing FFRs under these conditions does not add to the body's thermophysiologic or perceptual burdens."

Among health care-associated infections (HAIs), Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. As national progress toward CDI prevention continues, it will be critical to ensure that the benefits from CDI prevention are realized across different patient demographic groups, including any targeted interventions.
Methods
Through a comprehensive review of existing evidence for racial/ethnic and other disparities in CDIs, we identified a few general trends, but the results were heterogeneous and highlight significant gaps in the literature.
Results
The majority of analyzed studies identified white patients as at increased risk of CDIs, although there is a very limited literature base, and many studies had significant methodological limitations.
Conclusion
Key recommendations for future research are provided to address antimicrobial stewardship programs and populations that may be at increased risk for CDIs."

Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are an urgent concern in health care in the United States because of high attributable mortality and versatile resistance mechanisms. CRE reporting was mandated in New York State (NYS) hospitals in July 2013.
Methods
Infection preventionists from the NYS Department of Health audited hospital-reported CRE data by comparing laboratory records with cases reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). Information regarding microbiology laboratory testing methodologies was obtained through a survey in October 2013.
Results
There were 1,151 CRE laboratory reports audited, with 13.6% determined not to have been reported to the NHSN when they should have been and 4.6% determined to be reported in error. There were a variety of errors, including lapses in surveillance and misinterpretation of the surveillance definition.
Conclusion
Educational initiatives that include microbiology laboratory staff, improvements in the use of laboratory information systems to communicate with infection prevention, and updated NHSN definitions should improve the accuracy and consistency of CRE reporting in NYS."

abstract = "Background
In the United States, bloodstream infections (BSIs) are predominated by Staphylococcus aureus. The proportion of community-acquired methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) BSI is on the rise. The goal of this study is to explore the epidemiology of BSI caused by S aureus within Staten Island, New York.
Methods
This is a case-case-control study from April 2012-October 2014. Cases were comprised of patients with BSI secondary to MRSA and methicillin-sensitive S aureus (MSSA). The control group contained patients who were hospitalized during the same time period as cases but did not develop infections during their stay. Two multivariable models compared each group of cases with the uninfected controls.
Results
A total of 354 patients were analyzed. Infections were community acquired in 76% of cases. The major source of BSI was skin-related infections (n = 76). The first multivariable model showed that recent central venous catheter placement was an independent infection risk factor (odds ratio [OR] = 80.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.2-3,014.1). In the second model, prior hospital stay >3 days (OR = 4.1; 95% CI, 1.5-5.7) and chronic kidney disease (OR = 3.0; 95% CI, 1.01-9.2) were uniquely associated with MSSA. Persistent bacteremia, recurrence, and other hospital-acquired infections were more likely with MRSA BSI than MSSA BSI.
Conclusion
Most infections were community acquired. The presence of a central venous catheter constituted a robust independent risk factor for MRSA BSI. Patients with MRSA BSI suffered worse outcomes than those with MSSA BSI."

abstract = "Background
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a frequent cause of orthopedic surgical site infections (SSIs). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a bundle approach in the prevention of orthopedic MRSA SSIs.
Material and Methods
MRSA active surveillance and decolonization were performed preoperatively at our institution from July 2004 until 2007. In January 2008, a bundle approach comprising contact precautions for MRSA-positive patients and cefazolin-based antimicrobial prophylaxis (AMP) stewardship was implemented. Data on the prevalence of MRSA SSIs, antimicrobial use density, duration of AMP, and the use of an alcohol antiseptic agent (L/1,000 patient-days) were evaluated during 2 periods: July 2004-December 2007 (period A) and January 2008-December 2012 (period B).
Results and Discussion
The MRSA SSI rate during period B (0.97%; 19 out of 1,966) was significantly lower than that during period A (2.17%; 29 out of 1,333; P = .003). The infection rate correlated negatively with both the cefazolin antimicrobial use density (r = −0.76; P = .0002) and the use of an alcohol antiseptic agent (r = −0.68; P = .002).
Conclusions
An infection-prevention bundle consisting of contact precautions for carriers and AMP stewardship in addition to active surveillance was associated with a significant decrease in the incidence of orthopedic MRSA SSIs."

To examine the association between hospital and clinician obstetric volume and postpartum infection risk in the pre- and postdischarge periods.
Methods
We used data from the 2011 New York State Inpatient and Emergency Department Databases to fit generalized estimating equation models to examine the effect of hospital and clinician obstetric volume on infection before discharge and in the 30 days after discharge after delivery.
Results
Higher clinician volume was associated with lower predischarge infection risk (odds ratio [OR] for first vs third quartile was 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77-0.98). There was an uncertain trend toward higher predischarge infection risk in higher volume hospitals (OR for first vs third quartile was 1.36; 95% CI, 0.79-2.34). We found no associations between patient volumes and postdischarge infections; however, power was insufficient to rule out small associations. The joint association of hospital and clinician volumes with postdischarge infection appeared submultiplicative (product term OR = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92-0.98).
Conclusion
This study adds to the evidence that hospital obstetric volume is positively associated with predischarge postpartum infections, whereas clinician volume may be negatively associated with those predischarge infections. The associations between hospital obstetric volume and postdischarge infection appear to differ. These results underscore the importance of including postdischarge follow-up in hospital-based studies of postpartum infection."

abstract = "Background
Family-centered care requires that institutions develop strategies to allow sibling visitors to hospitalized children while reducing risks of infectious disease transmission. Most guidelines recommend that siblings not be permitted to visit playrooms. This approach was not seen as consistent with family-centered care in our setting; therefore, in a pilot project we developed an approach for screening siblings with cooperation of families, child life specialists, the care team, and the infection prevention and control service.
Methods
A literature review using CINAHL and PubMed databases (Medical Subject Heading terms: visitors to patients, child, infection, nosocomial, and siblings) from 2004-2014 did not uncover formal established methods for reducing playroom infectious disease exposures. Benchmarking with other Canadian centers revealed a diversity of approaches. Child life, the ward staff, and infection prevention and control at this center collaborated to develop a sibling screening strategy.
Results
The collaborative approach led to a process based on a screening form that is introduced to the family during admission. The process requires the cooperation of the admitting nurse, parents, and child life staff. In the first 2 years of the project, approximately 10% of screened siblings had a potentially communicable illness.
Conclusion
A collaborative multidisciplinary approach based on family center care principles led to a process whereby siblings of hospitalized children can be allowed to visit playrooms, while reducing risk of infectious disease transmission."

A history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a determinant of inpatient bed assignment.
Methods
We assessed outcomes associated with rapid testing and discontinuation of MRSA contact precautions (CP) in a prospective cohort study of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based screening in the Emergency Department (ED) of Massachusetts General Hospital. Eligible patients had a history of MRSA and were assessed and enrolled if documented off antibiotics with activity against MRSA and screened for nasal colonization (subject visit). PCR-negative subjects had CP discontinued; the primary outcome was CP discontinuation. We identified semiprivate rooms in which a bed was vacant owing to the CP status of the study subject, calculated the hours of vacancy, and compared idle bed-hours by PCR results. Program costs were compared with predicted revenue.
Results
There were 2864 eligible patients, and 648 (22.6%) subject visits were enrolled. Of these, 65.1% (422/648) were PCR-negative and had CP discontinued. PCR-negative subjects had fewer idle bed-hours compared with PCR-positive subjects (28.6 ± 25.2 vs 75.3 ± 70.5; P < .001). The expected revenues from occupied idle beds and averted CP costs ranged from $214,160 to $268,340, and exceeded the program costs.
Conclusion
A program of targeted PCR-based screening for clearance of MRSA colonization resulted in expected revenues and decreased CP costs that outweighed programmatic costs."

Mycobacterium abscessus infection in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) can result in accelerated clinical decline and the potential for direct or indirect transmission between patients has been recently demonstrated. Data on the outcomes of M abscessus outbreaks and the efficacy of specific infection control procedures in patients with CF remain limited. This study provides follow-up from an outbreak of pulmonary M abscessus in our center, highlighting outcomes and strategies that appear to have prevented further spread of the organism.
Methods
Data from our adult CF center (1989-2015) were analyzed, including chart reviews of all patients with positive mycobacterial sputum cultures, cultures from environment surfaces, and epidemiologic evaluation of infected patients. Following an M abscessus outbreak in 2009, infection control policies were intensified based on CF guidelines and surveillance data were collected and reviewed.
Results
Five cases of M abscessus were involved in the outbreak; 3 patients died during follow-up. An environment search failed to reveal an intermediary source of transmission between patients. After implementation of infection control measures composed of staff/patient education, environment sterilization, and patient isolation, no new cases were detected.
Conclusions
Direct or indirect patient-to-patient transmission of M abscessus is a threat in the CF population. A multifaceted infection control strategy based on CF guidelines was effective in halting transmission in our center."

abstract = "Background
Obtaining a specimen for urine culture is a key element in evaluating for catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs). Evaluating nurses' knowledge regarding appropriate reasons and methods to obtain urine culture specimens are the first steps to improving practice.
Methods
Nurses at 5 hospitals completed a 40-question survey regarding their knowledge, training, and practices of appropriate reasons for obtaining urine cultures. The survey included different scenarios of patients with urinary catheters and when they would expect to obtain urine cultures. A 12-point scoring system calculated responses regarding urine collection appropriateness.
Results
There were 394 nurses who responded to the survey. Of them, 76.1% reported receiving education on CAUTI risk reduction within the last 12 months. Although 327 (83%) of all nurses surveyed reported that they never collect urine samples by draining directly from the drainage bag, only 58.4% viewed others to be fully compliant with that standard (P < .001). Nurses who considered their knowledge to be above average to excellent had similar knowledge assessment scores (out of 12 points) for triggers to obtain urine cultures (mean score, 4.9 ± 1.72) compared with those that reported average to poor knowledge (mean score, 4.64 ± 1.78; P = .15).
Conclusions
Important opportunities exist for nurses to optimize the decisions to obtain urine cultures and the process for obtaining them. Addressing nurses' knowledge and practice may lead to more appropriate use of urine cultures."

This study was designed to survey psychologic discomfort and coping processes of health care workers that suffered needlestick injuries (NSIs).
Methods
This qualitative analysis was performed with 15 health care workers who experienced NSIs. Data were collected using face-to-face interviews. The study subjects were asked the following: please describe the psychologic discomfort that you experienced after the NSI incidence. Data were evaluated by qualitative content analysis.
Results
Types of psychologic discomfort after NSI among health care workers included anxiety, anger, and feelings of guilt. Some personnel adopted active coping strategies, such as seeking first aid or reporting the incident to a monitoring system, whereas others used passive coping methods, such as avoidance of reporting the incident, vague expectancy to have no problems, and reliance on religious beliefs. Recommended support strategies to improve the prevention of NSIs were augmenting employee education and increasing recognition of techniques for avoiding NSIs.
Conclusion
Medical institutions need to provide employees with repeated education so that they are familiar with guidelines for preventing NSIs and to stimulate their alertness to the risk of injuries at any time, in any place, and to anybody."

We investigated an increase in Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) among pediatric oncology patients.
Methods
CDI cases were defined as first C difficile positive stool tests between December 1, 2010, and September 6, 2012, in pediatric oncology patients receiving inpatient or outpatient care at a single hospital. A case-control study was performed to identify CDI risk factors, infection prevention and antimicrobial prescribing practices were assessed, and environmental sampling was conducted. Available isolates were strain-typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
Results
An increase in hospital-onset CDI cases was observed from June-August 2012. Independent risk factors for CDI included hospitalization in the bone marrow transplant ward and exposure to computerized tomography scanning or cefepime in the prior 12 weeks. Cefepime use increased beginning in late 2011, reflecting a practice change for patients with neutropenic fever. There were 13 distinct strain types among 22 available isolates. Hospital-onset CDI rates decreased to near-baseline levels with enhanced infection prevention measures, including environmental cleaning and prolonged contact isolation.
Conclusion
C difficile strain diversity associated with a cluster of CDI among pediatric oncology patients suggests a need for greater understanding of modes and sources of transmission and strategies to reduce patient susceptibility to CDI. Further research is needed on the risk of CDI with cefepime and its use as primary empirical treatment for neutropenic fever."

Operating room nurses are at high risk for occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens. This study examined the prevalence of and risk factors for needlestick injuries (NSIs), sharps injuries (SIs), and blood and body fluid exposures (BBFEs) among operating room nurses in Thai hospitals.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was performed in 247 Thai hospitals. Questionnaires eliciting demographic data and information on injury occurrence and risk factors were distributed to 2500 operating room nurses, and 2031 usable questionnaires were returned, for a response rate of 81.2%. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using multiple logistic regression analysis.
Results
The prevalence of NSIs, SIs, and BBFEs was 23.7%, 9.8%, and 40.0%, respectively. Risk factors for NSIs were training without practice (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.29-2.17), haste (OR, 4.81; 95% CI, 3.41-6.79), lack of awareness (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.04-1.77), inadequate staffing (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.21-2.11), and outdated guidelines (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.04-2.74). One risk factor was identified for SIs: haste (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.57-3.76). Risk factors for BBFEs were long working hours per week (OR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.06-4.04), training without practice (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.25-1.91), haste (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.30-2.13), lack of awareness (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.22-1.95), not wearing protective equipment (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.26-2.06), and inadequate staffing (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.26-2.11).
Conclusion
This study highlights the high prevalence of NSIs, SIs, and BBFEs among Thai operating room nurses. Preventable risk factors were identified. Appropriate guidelines, adequate staffing, proper training, and self-awareness may reduce these occurrences."

abstract = "Background
Postexposure prophylaxis for occupational exposure to hepatitis B virus (HBV) plays an important role in the prevention of HBV infections in health care workers (HCWs). We examined data concerning the acceptable duration between occupational exposure and administration of a hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) injection in an occupational clinical setting.
Methods
A retrospective analysis was conducted with data from 143 cases of HCWs exposed to HBV in 15 secondary and tertiary teaching hospitals between January 2005 and June 2013. Data were taken from the infection control records of each hospital.
Results
Active vaccination after HBV exposure was started in 119 cases (83.2%) and postvaccination testing for hepatitis B antibody showed positive seroconversion in 93% of cases. In 98 cases (68.5%), HBIG was administered within 24 hours after HBV exposure; however, 45 HCWs (31.5%) received an HBIG injection more than 24 hours postexposure and 2 among the 45 received an injection after 7 days. Although 31.5% received an HBIG injection more than 24 hours postexposure, no cases of seroconversion to hepatitis b antibody positivity occurred.
Conclusions
For susceptible HCWs, HBIG administered between 24 hours and 7 days postexposure may be as effective as administration within 24 hours in preventing occupational HBV infection."

After the presentations, the panel will address a set of preformulated questions on selection criteria for surrogate microbes to study the survival and inactivation of airborne human pathogens, desirable features of technologies for microbial decontamination of indoor air, knowledge gaps, and research needs. It is anticipated that the deliberations of the workshop will provide the attendees with an update on the significance of indoor air as a vehicle for transmitting human pathogens with a brief on what is currently being done to mitigate the risks from airborne infectious agents."
