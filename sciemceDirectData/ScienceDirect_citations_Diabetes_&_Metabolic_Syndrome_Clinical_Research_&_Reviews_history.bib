Diabetes mellitus is associated with poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 contributes to worsening of dysglycemia in people with diabetes mellitus over and above that contributed by stress hyperglycemia. Herein, we have reviewed the two-way interactions between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus.
Methods
We have performed an extensive literature search for articles in PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar databases till April 25, 2020, with the following keywords: “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “diabetes”, “diabetes mellitus”, “SARS”, “infection” and “management of diabetes mellitus” with interposition of the Boolean operator “AND”.
Results
Compromised innate immunity, pro-inflammatory cytokine milieu, reduced expression of ACE2 and use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonists in people with diabetes mellitus contribute to poor prognosis in COVID-19. On the contrary, direct β-cell damage, cytokine-induced insulin resistance, hypokalemia and drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 (like corticosteroids, lopinavir/ritonavir) can contribute to worsening of glucose control in people with diabetes mellitus.
Conclusions
The two-way interaction between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus sets up a vicious cycle wherein COVID-19 leads to worsening of dysglycemia and diabetes mellitus, in turn, exacerbates the severity of COVID-19. Thus, it is imperative that people with diabetes mellitus take all necessary precautions and ensure good glycemic control amid the ongoing pandemic."

Communication plays an important role in advancing public health goals as well as in greater appreciation of underlying science and public policies. It is critical at all times, be it promoting health benefits of immunisation, importance of hand hygiene or taking personal measures for prevention of non-communicable diseases. Communication assumes even greater importance in the time of emergencies like the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. A primary vehicle for health communication is mass media like television channels, newspapers and radio channels.
Methods
An analysis of current trends shows that the messages emerging from mass media are getting further amplified and dispersed through digital outlets and social media platforms which have become immensely popular. This has also given rise to a new phenomenon called infodemic or over-abundance of information – both genuine and fake.
Results
The article examines role of mass media in health communication in times of pandemic and the context of infodemic.
Conclusions
The analysis points to the need for improvement in health journalism to improve its quality, credibility as well as relevance in a country like India where mass media consumption is high and health literacy is low."

Photobiomodulation is an emerging therapy for Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) of which the management is still a dilemma for clinicians. Elevated Neuron Specific Enolase (NSE) is associated with neuropathy. We aimed this study to assess the effect of Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) on Serum Neuron Specific Enolase in Type II Diabetes Mellitus patients with DPN.
Methodology
Pre post interventional study was done on 50 patients with DPN. DPN was confirmed using 10g Monofilament test, Vibration perception threshold (VPT) and Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument. All patients were provided with LLLT for 9 min on dorsal and plantar of foot with a dosage of 3.1 J/cm 2 for 10 days. A blood sample was collected at baseline and 4 weeks after LLLT for NSE estimation.
Result
A significant reduction in serum NSE levels (0.006) after 4 weeks of laser therapy was observed in 42 patients when compared with baseline. A significant reduction in the vibration perception threshold (p = 0.003) and Numeric pain rating scale (p = 0.004) were observed.
Conclusion
In this pilot study, we have assessed the effect of LLLT on serum NSE levels among patients with DPN and showed improved quality of life and decrease in serum NSE levels. These findings should be investigated in larger trials."

abstract = "Background
Along with its high infectivity and fatality rates, the 2019 Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) has caused universal psychosocial impact by causing mass hysteria, economic burden and financial losses. Mass fear of COVID-19, termed as “coronaphobia”, has generated a plethora of psychiatric manifestations across the different strata of the society. So, this review has been undertaken to define psychosocial impact of COVID-19.
Methods
Pubmed and GoogleScholar are searched with the following key terms- “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV2”, “Pandemic”, “Psychology”, “Psychosocial”, “Psychitry”, “marginalized”, “telemedicine”, “mental health”, “quarantine”, “infodemic”, “social media” and” “internet”. Few news paper reports related to COVID-19 and psychosocial impacts have also been added as per context.
Results
Disease itself multiplied by forced quarantine to combat COVID-19 applied by nationwide lockdowns can produce acute panic, anxiety, obsessive behaviors, hoarding, paranoia, and depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the long run. These have been fueled by an “infodemic” spread via different platforms of social media. Outbursts of racism, stigmatization, and xenophobia against particular communities are also being widely reported. Nevertheless, frontline healthcare workers are at higher-risk of contracting the disease as well as experiencing adverse psychological outcomes in form of burnout, anxiety, fear of transmitting infection, feeling of incompatibility, depression, increased substance-dependence, and PTSD. Community-based mitigation programs to combat COVID-19 will disrupt children’s usual lifestyle and may cause florid mental distress. The psychosocial aspects of older people, their caregivers, psychiatric patients and marginalized communities are affected by this pandemic in different ways and need special attention.
Conclusion
For better dealing with these psychosocial issues of different strata of the society, psychosocial crisis prevention and intervention models should be urgently developed by the government, health care personnel and other stakeholders. Apt application of internet services, technology and social media to curb both pandemic and infodemic needs to be instigated. Psychosocial preparedness by setting up mental organizations specific for future pandemics is certainly necessary."

Glucocorticoids and the GR serve as an essential molecular mediator of stress and different physiologic processes. This review summarizes main findings from studies on the role of the GC/GR signaling in the modulation of genes for nutrient processing by the different organs involved in metabolic diseases.
Methods
Descriptive review of relevant papers known to the author was conducted.
Results
Several high-throughput screenings in the past 15 years have identified potential GR DNA-binding regions in different cell types with genes that are annotated to be important for the control of metabolism. Transcriptional regulation of these GC-responsive genes provides links between the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) and systemic energy homeostasis in both physiological and pathophysiological states. Future studies must reconsider the use of agonist, the utilization of animal models of stress and metabolic disorders, and validation in humans.
Conclusion
This review recapitulates the significant role of the GC/GR signaling in molecular metabolic control and metabolic disorders. Potential future research focus and optimizations have also been identified."

abstract = "Background and aims
In type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), sexual dimorphisms modulate the natural histories of hyperglycemia, anthropophysical/cardiometabolic phenotype, and susceptibility to chronic micro and macrovascular complications. The purpose of this work was to revisit known or new dimorphisms within a multiethnic cohort.
Methods
Among 1238 T2DM patients, men (63%) were compared to women (37%), including leading ethnicities: Whites (67.4%; 542 men; 293 women); Maghrebians (9.4%; 62 men; 54 women); and Blacks (12.5%; 92 men; 63 women).
Results
Age, BMI, diabetes duration, insulin sensitivity, B-cell function loss, HbA1c, and hyperglycemia index were similar in both genders. All-cause microangiopathy and cerebrovascular disease did not differ between sexes. Women had significantly more retinopathy (27% vs. 21%) and men more microalbuminuria (25% vs. 19%), all-cause macroangiopathy (40% vs. 26%), CAD (29% vs. 17%) and PAD (11% vs. 6%). Among Blacks, sexual dimorphism in terms of retinopathy was more pronounced (24% in women vs. 11%), while there was no sexual dimorphism in all-cause macroangiopathy, CAD or PAD. B-cell function loss was faster among North African men (+15%), who also had more hepatic steatosis (+27%) than women.
Conclusions
T2DM abolishes the CV protection provided by the female gender in Blacks. In White women, the loss of CV protection in diabetes is limited to cerebrovascular disease. In Black women, a markedly increased risk of retinopathy is present, despite glycemic exposure similat to men. Sexual dimorphisms do not affect glucose homeostasis and metabolic control in all ethnicities, except for lesser B-cell function loss in Maghrebian women."

abstract = "Background and aims
To undertake a review and critical appraisal of published/preprint reports that offer methods of determining the effects of hypertension, diabetes, stroke, cancer, kidney issues, and high-cholesterol on COVID-19 disease severity.
Methods
A search was conducted by two authors independently on the freely available COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). We developed an automated search engine to screen a total of 59,000 articles in a few seconds. Filtering of the articles was then undertaken using keywords and questions, e.g. “Effects of diabetes on COVID/normal coronavirus/SARS-CoV-2/nCoV/COVID-19 disease severity, mortality?“. The search terms were repeated for all the comorbidities considered in this paper. Additional articles were retrieved by searching via Google Scholar and PubMed.
Findings
A total of 54 articles were considered for a full review. It was observed that diabetes, hypertension, and cholesterol levels possess an apparent relation to COVID-19 severity. Other comorbidities, such as cancer, kidney disease, and stroke, must be further evaluated to determine a strong relationship to the virus.
Conclusion
Reports associating cancer, kidney disease, and stroke with COVID-19 should be carefully interpreted, not only because of the size of the samples, but also because patients could be old, have a history of smoking, or have any other clinical condition suggesting that these factors might be associated with the poor COVID-19 outcomes rather than the comorbidity itself. Further research regarding this relationship and its clinical management is warranted."

As, the COVID-19 has been deemed a pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO), and since it spreads everywhere throughout the world, investigation in relation to this disease is very much essential. Investigation of pattern in the occurrence of COVID-19, to check the influence of different meteorological factors on the incidence of COVID-19 and prediction of incidence of COVID-19 are the objectives of this paper.
Methods
For trend analysis, Sen’s Slope and Man-Kendall test have been used, Generalized Additive Model (GAM) of regression has been used to check the influence of different meteorological factors on the incidence and to predict the frequency of COVID-19, and Verhulst (Logistic) Population Model has been used.
Results
Statistically significant linear trend found for the daily-confirmed cases of COVID-19. The regression analysis indicates that there is some influence of the interaction of average temperature (AT) and average relative humidity (ARH) on the incidence of COVID-19. However, this result is not consistent throughout the study area. The projections have been made up to 21st May, 2020.
Conclusions
Trend and regression analysis give an idea of the incidence of COVID-19 in India while projection made by Verhulst (Logistic) Population Model for the confirmed cases of the study area are encouraging as the sample prediction is as same as the actual number of confirmed COVID-19 cases."

The mortality observed in Indian and south Asian subcontinent is lower than in the west. Multifactorial reasons indicated for this differential mortality due to COVID-19 have been described in the current literature.
Conclusions
The effects of COVID-19 on the health of racial and ethnic minority groups are still emerging with disproportionate burden of illness and death amongst some black and ethnic minority groups. Overall the current COVID-19 related mortality appears to be lower in the health and resource challenged populous Indian subcontinent.

COVID 19 is a novel pandemic affecting globally. Although no reliable data suggests that patients of well controlled Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) being at increased risk of becoming severely ill with SARS-CoV2, but lockdown may impact patients with T1DM requiring regular medications and follow up. Hence this study was planned to see the impact of lockdown on glycemic control in patients with T1DM.
Methods
A cross sectional study was done in T1DM patients in whom a structured questionnaire was administered on follow up within 15 days after lockdown. Data regarding hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic episodes, Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), insulin dose missed, regular glucose monitoring, dietary compliance, physical activity, hospitalization during the phase of lockdown was taken. Average blood glucose and HbA1C of lockdown phase was compared with the readings of prelockdown phase.
Results
Out of 52 patients, 36.5% had hyperglycemic and 15.3% had hypoglycemic episodes. Insulin dose was missed in 26.9%, glucose monitoring not done routinely in 36.5% and 17.4% were not diet compliant during lockdown. Average blood glucose during lockdown phase was 276.9 ± 64.7 mg/dl as compared to 212.3 ± 57.9 mg/dl during prelockdown phase. Mean HbA1c value of lockdown (10 ± 1.5%) which was much higher that of pre lockdown (8.8 ± 1.3%) and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05).
Conclusion
Glycemic control of T1DM patients has worsened mainly due to non availability of insulin/glucostrips during lockdown period. There is a need for preparedness in future so that complications can be minimised."

abstract = "Background and aim
Studies in cell cultures and animal models have revealed the possible pathophysiological factors associated with vascular endothelial dysfunction. However, the same in human subjects has not been clearly established. The current study uses a novel approach to identify the factors associated with endothelial function and arterial function by altering these vascular parameters using Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme (ACE) inhibition.
Methods
Diabetic patients with newly diagnosed hypertension (n = 60) were recruited for the study. Flow-mediated-dilation (FMD), carotid-femoral (cf), carotid-radial (cr) Pulse-wave-velocity (PWV), Augmentation-Index, Carotid-Intima-Media-Thickness (CIMT), serum levels of Renin, Angiotensin II (AngII), Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme2 (ACE2), Angiotensin1-7 (Ang1-7), E-selectin, Vascular-Cell-Adhesion-Molecule-1 (VCAM-1), Highly-sensitive-C-Reactive-Protein (hsCRP) and Interleukin-10 were measured at baseline (V1), after 1 week (V2) and 3 months (V3) of ACE inhibition in patients of diabetes with newly diagnosed hypertension. The amplitude of change after 1 week (V2–V1) and 3 months (V3–V1) for the clinical and various parameters were correlated with the change in endothelial function and arterial stiffness.
Results
Carotid radial-PWVV2-V1 (p = 0.001) and Ang1-7V2–V1 (p = 0.01) emerged as independent predictors of FMDV2-V1. ReninV2-V1 and VCAM-1V2–V1 independently predicted E-selectinV2-V1 [(p = 0.01) and (p = 0.001), respectively]. ACE 2V2–V1 was the only independent predictor of cf-PWVV2-V1. The same parameters remained as independent predictors of the respective vascular factors after 3 months of ACE inhibition.
Conclusion
The study highlights the role of AngII/Ang1-7 balance in alteration of endothelial function and central arterial stiffness in humans in addition to identifying the interrelationship between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system components and clinically ascertainable parameters."

abstract = "Background and aims
Interest in corticosteroid therapy in COVID-19 has been rekindled after the results from Randomized Evaluation of COVid-19 thERapY (RECOVERY) Trial. However, the World health Organization has not recommended corticosteroid in the treatment of COVID-19. We sought to conduct a systematic review on the role of corticosteroid in the management of patients of COVID-19.
Methods
A systematic electronic search of PubMed, Cochrane and MedRxiv database using specific keywords was made up till June 17, 2020. Full text of all the original articles with supplementary appendix that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were retrieved and a detailed analysis of results were represented.
Results
Of the 5 studies (4 retrospective studies and 1 quasi-prospective study) conducted for evaluating the role of corticosteroids, 3 studies have shown benefit, while 2 studies shown no benefit and there was a suggestion of significant harm in critical cases in one sub-study. RECOVERY trial is the only randomized controlled trial that has shown a significant reduction of death by 35% in ventilated patients and by 20% amongst patients on supplemental oxygen therapy with the dexamethasone, although no benefit was observed in mild cases.
Conclusions
While the results from retrospective studies are heterogenous and difficult to infer of a definitive protective benefit with corticosteroids, RECOVERY trial found a significantly better outcome with dexamethasone, mostly in severe cases. Nonetheless, more studies are needed to replicate the outcome shown in RECOVERY trial for a substantial conclusion."

Diabetic foot syndrome is a severe complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Increased maximum plantar pressure is a strong predictor that may be detrimental and cause a plantar ulcer. This present systematic review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of customized insoles on reducing maximum plantar pressure in diabetic foot syndrome.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review (PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CINAHL, Pedro, Scopus) to summarize the evidence on the customized insole on maximum plantar pressure in diabetic foot syndrome. Randomized and non-randomized studies were included in the review. The quality of the included studies was assessed independently by the two review authors with the Modified Downs and Black checklist for the assessment of the methodological quality of both randomized and non-randomized studies.
Results
A total of 1512 studies screened. After the exclusion criteria, 5 studies were included in the study. The outcome measure that was considered is maximum plantar pressure and pressure-time integral.
Conclusions
We concluded that the practice of customized insoles could significantly reduce maximum plantar pressure. While developing an insole, parameters like contoured insoles with shape and pressure based, weight-bearing position, and duration with good adherence to footwear application can significantly reduce maximum plantar pressure."

This study aimed to investigate the nutrient contents and the anti-hyperglycemic effect of the immature endosperm of sugar palm (IESP) (Borassus flabellifer L.) fruit on type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients.
Methods
This is a short type case study where patients (n = 30) with T2DM were randomly selected and fed IESP (100 mL) twice a day after a regular meal and continued this experiment up to 4th weeks.
Result
The mean fasting blood glucose (FBG) level was markedly reduced from 1st week (15.74 mmol/L) to 4th week (10.53 mmol/L) among the patients who had normal body mass index (18.5–24.9). Only 16.67% diabetic patients had irregular FBG levels where 10% were in the previous stages after finishing the experimental period, and exceptionally in the case of 6.67% diabetic patients, this therapeutic juice was unsuccessful because of their irregular intake of insulin. The IESP was more effective on female (p ≤ 0.001) patients than males (p ≤ 0.05).
Conclusion
The IESP could be considered as anti-hyperglycemic fruit, and this might be due to its nutrient contents, especially phytochemicals, fiber, sodium, potassium, copper, and zinc."

To determine the prevalence of hypogonadism among Indian men with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and evaluate its association with various metabolic parameters.
Methods
One hundred fifty consecutive men with T2DM, aged 25–70 years, and one hundred age-matched healthy men without diabetes were included. The free testosterone (FT) level was calculated using the total testosterone (TT), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and albumin levels in serum. Patients with a calculated FT level <6.35 ng/dL and a positive response on the androgen deficiency in aging male questionnaire (ADAM) were diagnosed with hypogonadism.
Results
The prevalence of hypogonadism was 17.3% and 10% in men with and without T2DM, respectively. The body mass index (BMI) and the mean levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), TT, SHBG, Triglycerides (TG), and FT were significantly different between the groups. The mean BMI and TG levels were significantly higher in patients with T2DM than in those without. Both groups showed a significant negative correlation between the BMI and SHBG level.

Regenerating islet-derived protein 3-beta (Reg3β) and oncostatin-M (OSM), an inducer of Reg3β, are important for the recruitment of macrophages, tissue repair and survival after myocardial infarction. The study was planned to elucidate the diagnostic utility of serum Reg3β and OSM levels for the acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
Methods
Forty-two type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with ACS as cases and forty-two T2DM patients as controls were recruited. Routine biochemical investigations, creatine kinase-total (CK-T), and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) levels were estimated. Serum Reg3β and OSM levels were analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Results
Serum Reg3β and OSM levels were significantly higher in cases as compared to controls. Serum Reg3β and OSM levels were positively correlated with random blood glucose, serum CK-total, CK-MB levels, and negatively correlated with serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis showed that serum OSM and Reg3β levels can be used for the diagnosis of ACS in patients with T2DM as compared to CK-MB levels. On regression analysis, serum Reg3β level was positively associated with body mass index and negatively with serum HDL-C levels and serum OSM level was positively associated with waist circumference and random blood glucose and negatively with serum HDL-C levels.
Conclusion
Serum Reg3β and OSM levels may be used as complementary markers besides traditional cardiac markers for the diagnosis of ACS in patients with T2DM. However, further studies are still needed to verify our claim."

Hypoglycemia is the limiting factor in the glycemic management of diabetes, which need to be addressed critically to avoid complications. Lockdown because of new coronavirus strain (COVID-19) pandemic has further complicated the issue of hypoglycemia due to limitations in access to food, outpatient clinics, pathological services and medicines.
Aim
To assess the factors associated with the risk of hypoglycemia during April–May 2020 lockdown in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Methodology
We analyzed the data retrospectively from 146 patients of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) reporting to the emergency department (ED) during lockdown period with symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia.
Results
The majority of patients were male (90/146) with a mean age of 59.88 ± 10.09 years and a mean random blood glucose level of 57.67 ± 9.00 mg/dL. Two-third of patients (70.83%) had level 1 hypoglycemia, while level 2 hypoglycemia was reported in 29.16% of patients. A combination of Metformin and Sulfonylureas (SU) was most commonly associated with the risk of hypoglycemia (65.75%) followed by insulin (33.56%). Subjects who received insulin reported a lower blood glucose value (50.75 ± 8.20 mg/dL) as compared to those receiving a combination of metformin and SU (60.95 ± 7.10 mg/dl). 330.56% of patients who had received prophylaxis hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 400 mg twice a day along with the routine anti-hyperglycemic agents without their dose adjustment reported hypoglycemia. Patients with hypertension, micro-vascular, macro-vascular complications, and coexistent with each other had a higher propensity to the risk of hypoglycemia (46.58%, 33.56%, 23.29%, and 32.88%) respectively.
Conclusion
The COVID-19 lockdown has shown to influence the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with T2DM, especially those receiving SU, insulin, HCQ especially in patients with associated co-morbidities. Patient education, support, and telemedicine plays a pivotal role to prevent hypoglycemia."

There have been recent mounting concerns regarding multiple reports stating a significantly elevated relative-risk of COVID-19 mortality amongst the Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) population. An urgent national enquiry investigating the possible reasons for this phenomenon has been issued in the UK. Inflammation is at the forefront of COVID-19 research as disease severity appears to correlate with pro-inflammatory cytokine dysregulation. This narrative review aims to shed light on the novel, pathophysiological role of inflammation in contributing towards the increased COVID-19 mortality risk amongst the BAME population.
Methods
Searches in PubMed, Medline, Scopus, medRxiv and Google Scholar were performed to identify articles published in English from inception to 18th June 2020. These databases were searched using keywords including: ‘COVID-19’ or ‘Black and Minority Ethnic’ or ‘Inflammation’. A narrative review was synthesized using these included articles.
Results
We suggest a novel pathophysiological mechanism by which acute inflammation from COVID-19 may augment existing chronic inflammation, in order to potentiate a ‘cytokine storm’ and thus the more severe disease phenotype observed in the BAME population. Obesity, insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, psychological stress, chronic infections and genetic predispositions are all relevant factors which may be contributing to elevated chronic systemic inflammation amongst the BAME population.
Conclusion
Overall, this review provides early insights and directions for ongoing research regarding the pathophysiological mechanisms that may explain the severe COVID-19 disease phenotype observed amongst the BAME population. We suggest ‘personalization’ of chronic disease management, which can be used with other interventions, in order to tackle this."

abstract = "Background and aims
Metabolic syndrome is one of the serious public health problems among type 2 diabetic patients. Despite a number of studies have been conducted, there is no overall estimation on the prevalence of metabolic syndrome among type 2 diabetic patients in Sub-Saharan African countries. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of metabolic syndrome in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Sub –Saharan African countries.
Methods
PubMed, Web of Science, African Journals Online, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Wiley Online Library databases from inception to April 27, 2020 were searched to identify relevant studies. The I2 statistic was used to check heterogeneity across the included studies. DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model was applied to estimate pooled effect size, and 95% confidence interval across studies. A funnel plot and Egger's regression test were used to determine the presence of publication bias. Sensitivity analysis was deployed to determine the effect of a single study on the overall estimation. All statistical analyses were done using STATA™ Version 14 software.
Result
In this meta-analysis, a total of 23 studies with 6482 study participants were included. The estimated prevalence of metabolic syndrome in Sub-Saharan African countries was 59.62% (95% CI: 52.20, 67.03). Based on the subgroup analysis, the highest prevalence of metabolic syndrome (61.14%, 95% CI: 51.74, 70.53) was reported in Ethiopia. Additionally, the highest prevalence of metabolic syndrome was reported across studies using the diagnostic criteria of National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III 64.8% (95% CI: 54.74, 74.86), followed by International Diabetic Federation (57.15%), and World health Organization (53.12%) definitions.
Conclusion
Almost two out of three type 2 diabetic patients in Sub-Saharan African countries have metabolic syndrome, which implies that its prevalence is high in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, policymakers need to design efficient strategies and guideline to reduce and control the burden of metabolic syndrome and its impact among diabetic population."

However, there is no information on the extent of diabetes expenditure in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMRO). Therefore, this study aimed to identify the treatment costs of diabetes in this area. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review on treatment expenditures of diabetes in EMRO countries.
Methods
A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PUBMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS and WEB OF SCIENCES databases to find out published manuscripts on treatment cost of diabetes. Information was extracted using data extraction sheets and then the data were imported into STATA software version.11. Mean annual treatment cost of diabetes per patient, annual treatment costs of diabetes per patient by Diabetes Mellitus (DM) complications and finally, cost of chronic diabetes complications per patient were pooled and reported.
Results
After reviewing title, abstract and the full text of identified articles; a total of seven studies were reported appropriate data for this meta-analysis. The pooled annual treatment cost per diabetes patient for EMRO countries was 1150 US$ (95% CI: 595–2221) which was 3358 US$ (95% CI: 2200–5124) in EMRO countries except of Iran compared to 255 US$ (92–708) in Iran. The treatment cost of diabetes was higher in males, insulin-used and in the patient with family history of diabetes. The cost of diabetes was significantly increased with the duration of diabetes (P = 0.001) as well. According to the results, the largest share of costs is related to medication costs. Finally, the pooled average annual treatment cost per patient by diabetes mellitus complications was varied from 2828 US$ in the patients that have cerebrovascular disease complication to 7261 US$ in the patients with Stroke complication.
Conclusions
This study demonstrated that the annual treatment cost of diabetes is varied within EMRO countries. Qatar and Iran have spent the highest and lowest cost for diabetes, respectively. This may be due to the large socioeconomic differences between countries and special conditions of them such as currency value in the region."

abstract = "Background and aims
Both type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular (CV) disease develops at a younger age in Asians and often have a higher risk of mortality. Both sodium-glucose co-transport-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2Is) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have shown a significant reduction in CV end-points in CV outcome trials (CVOTs). Whether similar CV benefit exists in Asians, is not yet clearly known.
Methods
We systematically searched relevant medical database up to January 31, 2020 and retrieved all the dedicated CVOTs conducted with SGLT-2Is and GLP-1RAs. Subsequently, we meta-analyzed the pooled data of hazard ratio (HR) of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in Asians. We additionally analyzed the data of heart failure hospitalization (HHF) or CV-death with SGLT-2Is in Asians.
Results
The meta-analysis of three CVOTs conducted with SGLT-2Is (N = 4987), did not find any significant reduction in MACE (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.15; P = 0.35) and HHF or CV-death (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.36; P = 0.53) in Asians, compared to the placebo. In contrast, the meta-analysis of seven CVOTs conducted with GLP-1RAs (N = 4298) demonstrated a significant reduction in MACE, compared to the placebo (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.86; P < 0.0001).
Conclusions
This meta-analysis found a significant reduction in MACE with GLP-1RAs but not with SGLT-2Is in Asians. No significant reduction in HHF or CV-death demonstrated either with SGLT-2Is in Asians. Whether these results are related to an inadequate statistical power, or due to underrepresentation of Asians, or a true ethnic difference, remains to be established."

The nationwide lockdown was imposed in India following novel coronavirus pandemic. In this paper, we discuss socio-economic, health and National healthcare challenges following lockdown, with focus on population belonging to low socio-economic stratum (SES).
Methods
A literature search was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar. In addition, existing guidelines including those by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, and articles from several non-academic sources (e.g. news websites etc.) were accessed.
Results
While the nationwide lockdown has resulted in financial losses and has affected all segments of society, the domino effect on health, healthcare and nutrition could possibly pose major setbacks to previously gained successes of National health programs.
Conclusion
Apart from firm economic measures, all National Health Programs should be re-strengthened to avert possible surge of communicable (apart from COVID19) and non-communicable diseases. These efforts should be focussed on population belonging to low SES."

As the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic unravels rapidly, there is a glut of confusing and divergent scientific information emanating from differing sources, including the Indian National Task Force for COVID-19. Thus, a web-based survey was conducted to decipher the approach of Indian doctors to the various options for treatment of COVID-19.
Methods
A web-based questionnaire among one lakh doctors across India through email and social media was circulated. After data quality and internal validation, 826 responses were included for analysis. Basic demographic and comparative analysis were performed using the Python3.8.2 software (Windows 10 64 bit, USA).
Results
Amongst all the states of India most respondents hailed from the top ten affected states. Overall 76.15% of doctors would either prescribe or consider prescribing hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as prophylaxis for health-care providers (HCP). Doctors with experience of managing COVID-19 were more likely to advocate use of HCQ as prophylaxis for HCP (χ2 = 4.357, P = 0.037). Intensivists were more likely to advocate HCQ as prophylaxis (χ2 = 14.588, P < 0.001) as well as for management of mild to moderate COVID-19 (χ2 = 3.91, P = 0.048). In COVID-19, 65.8% doctors overwhelmingly preferred using anti-viral agents in severe cases, continuing ACEi/ARB (60.9%), and routinely screening for COVID-19 as a pre-operative strategy (73.85%).
Conclusions
Indian doctors are largely following the scientific guidance provided by Indian National Task Force for COVID-19 and would consider prescribing HCQ as prophylaxis for COVID-19. They would also consider using it in mild to moderate COVID-19."

Erectile Dysfunction (ED) is more common in diabetic men and, unfortunately, occurs at an earlier age in diabetic patients when compared with the general population. The study aims to evaluate the independent predictors of ED in adult men with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) at a tertiary care center of South India.
Methods
A total of 720 men aged 30–70 years who had been diagnosed with type 2 DM were enrolled for the study from January 2017 to January 2020 from the outpatient diabetes clinic of the Hospital. All patients completed the abridged version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionnaire.
Results
The mean age of the patients was (58.4 ± 7.8 years). 68.6% of subjects had varying degrees of erectile dysfunction, of which 54.6% had moderate to severe ED. 55.8% had poor glycemic control (HbA1c ≥ 7%). Subjects with ED had a longer duration of DM than those without ED (mean DM duration was 8.1 ± 4.9 years versus 4.4 ± 3.5 years; p < 0.001). Longer duration of DM, poor glycemic control, hypertension, peripheral arterial disease, testosterone deficiency were all independent predictors ED (p < 0.05).
Conclusions
A high incidence of erectile dysfunction was observed in type 2 DM patients attending the diabetic clinic, and over half of the people affected were of moderate-to-severe in intensity. Poor glycemic control, testosterone deficiency, peripheral arterial disease were the modifiable risk factors for ED in diabetic subjects. At the same time, a longer duration of type 2 DM was noticed as a glaring non-modifiable risk factor, according to our study."

Results
Two studies available so far have studied the outcomes of severity and mortality in patients with diabetes stratified on glycemic control. Both the studies have unequivocally found that patients with poorly-controlled hyperglycemia (blood glucose >180 mg/dl) have significantly higher level of poor prognostic markers biochemically, compared to the well-controlled arms (blood glucose <180 mg/dl). Moreover, significant increase in severity and mortality was observed in cohorts with poorly-controlled blood glucose due to any cause (diabetes or stress hyperglycemia), compared to the well-controlled cohorts with COVID-19, even after the adjustment of multiple confounders.
Conclusions
Poorly-controlled hyperglycemia increases the severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19. All treating physician must strive for a good glycemic control (blood glucose <180 mg/dl) in patients with or without diabetes."

Clinical evidence exists that patients with diabetes are at higher risk for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We investigated the physiological origins of this clinical observation linking diabetes with severity and adverse outcome of COVID-19.
Methods
Publication mining was applied to reveal common physiological contexts in which diabetes and COVID-19 have been investigated simultaneously. Overall, we have acquired 1,121,078 publications from PubMed in the time span between 01-01-2000 and 17-04-2020, and extracted knowledge graphs interconnecting the topics related to diabetes and COVID-19.
Results
The Data Mining revealed three pathophysiological pathways linking diabetes and COVID-19. The first pathway indicates a higher risk for COVID-19 because of a dysregulation of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. The other two important physiological links between diabetes and COVID-19 are liver dysfunction and chronic systemic inflammation. A deep network analysis has suggested clinical biomarkers predicting the higher risk: Hypertension, elevated serum Alanine aminotransferase, high Interleukin-6, and low Lymphocytes count.
Conclusions
The revealed biomarkers can be applied directly in clinical practice. For newly infected patients, the medical history needs to be checked for evidence of a long-term, chronic dysregulation of these biomarkers. In particular, patients with diabetes, but also those with prediabetic state, deserve special attention."

Methods
WHO is curating global scientific literature on coronavirus since it declared COVID-19 a global pandemic through Global Research Database on COVID-19. The present study analyzed Indian publications on SARS-CoV-2 as found in WHO COVID-19 database. The research data was restricted for the period of March 2, 2020 to May 12, 2020.
Results
The study found that there is a considerable and constant growth of Indian publications on COVID-19 from mid-April. It is interesting to note that, the most prolific authors belong to either AIIMS or ICMR institutes. Delhi state contributed highest number of publications on COVID-19. The AIIMS, New Delhi was the most productive institution in terms of publications. The Indian Journal of Medical Research has emerged as the productive journal contributing highest number of the publications. In terms of research area, the majority of the publications were related to Epidemiology.
Conclusions
The highly cited publications were of evidenced based studies. It is observed that the studies pertaining to virology, diagnosis and treatment, clinical features etc. have received highest citations than general studies on epidemiology or pandemic."

COVID-19 outbreak has created havoc and a quick cure for the disease will be a therapeutic medicine that has usage history in patients to resolve the current pandemic. With technological advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) coupled with increased computational power, the AI-empowered drug repurposing can prove beneficial in the COVID-19 scenario.
Methods
The recent literature is studied and analyzed from various sources such as Scopus, Google Scholar, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore databases. The search terms used are ‘COVID-19′, ’ AI ′, and ‘Drug Repurposing’.
Results
AI is implemented in the field design through the generation of the learning-prediction model and performs a quick virtual screening to accurately display the output. With a drug-repositioning strategy, AI can quickly detect drugs that can fight against emerging diseases such as COVID-19. This technology has the potential to improve the drug discovery, planning, treatment, and reported outcomes of the COVID-19 patient, being an evidence-based medical tool.
Conclusions
Thus, there are chances that the application of the AI approach in drug discovery is feasible. With prior usage experiences in patients, few of the old drugs, if shown active against SARS-CoV-2, can be readily applied to treat the COVID-19 patients. With the collaboration of AI with pharmacology, the efficiency of drug repurposing can improve significantly."

Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients representing a huge health and economic burden. Despite the increasing number of patients with Diabetes Mellitus in Ethiopia, the incidence of diabetic nephropathy in patients with DM has not been well established. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the incidence and predictors of DN in patients with T2DM at tertiary healthcare setting, Ethiopia.
Methods
An institution based retrospective follow study was conducted from March 1 to April 28, 2019. Kaplan-meier survival curve together with log rank test were used. Cox proportional hazard model was used at 5% level of significance to determine the net effect of each explanatory variable on diabetic nephropathy. An assumption was check by schoenfeld residual test.
Results
The incidence rate of diabetic nephropathy was 3.6% per 100 person-years (95% CI = 2.49–11.47). The median time to develop nephropathy was 100(95% CI, 96.7–107) months. Predictors of diabetic nephropathy were males (AHR: 2.7, 95%CI: 1.39, 5.23), long duration of diabetes (AHR: 1.03, 95%CI: 1.01, 1.06), HbA1c> 7% (AHR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.67, 3.12), high density lipoprotein (AHR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.83), and mixed anti-diabetic therapy (AHR: 0.07, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.59).
Conclusion
The incidence of diabetic nephropathy among T2DM patients was relatively high. Males, longer duration of diabetes, HbA1c, and fasting blood glucose were increase the risk of diabetic nephropathy."

abstract = "Background and aims
Diabetes mellitus is one of the critical public health challenges in the Indian healthcare scenario. Novel anthropometric indices are promising surrogate markers to detect prediabetes compared to the traditional anthropometric indices that only reflect gross obesity. Thus, the authors aim to analyse the potential of three novel lipid combined anthropometric indices in predicting prediabetes in the Asian Indian population.
Methods
We conducted an age and gender-matched case-control study to identify the predictors of prediabetes. Prediabetes was diagnosed as per the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines 2010. The traditional anthropometric measurements including waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio (WHR) and body mass index (BMI) were executed using standardised methods. Fasting lipid profile was obtained and using standardised formulas, the novel lipid combined anthropometric indices such as lipid accumulation product (LAP), visceral adiposity index (VAI) and triglyceride glucose index (TyG index) were derived. TyG related indices such as triglyceride glucose-waist circumference (TyG-WC) and triglyceride glucose-body mass index (TyG-BMI) were also calculated.
Results
The novel lipid combined anthropometric indices LAP, VAI, TyG index, TyG-WC and TyG-BMI were significantly higher in subjects with prediabetes of both the genders (p < 0.05). During receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve evaluation, TyG index (AUC = 0.802) was the superior predictive measure in males, while in females, TyG-WC (AUC = 0.767) was the best among all the markers.
Conclusion
TyG index and TyG-WC seem to be a superior indicator of prediabetes in the Asian Indian population in comparison with other anthropometric indices to screen prediabetes."

Prediabetes is a risk state for the future development of type 2 diabetes. Previously, it was evident that the risk factors for diabetes differ by gender. However, conclusive evidence regarding the gender difference in modifiable risk factors associated with the presence of pre-diabetes is still lacking.
Aims
To systematically identify and summarize the available literature on whether the modifiable risk factors associated with prediabetes displays similar relationship in both the genders.
Methods
A systematic search was performed on electronic databases i.e. PubMed, EBSCOhost, and Scopus using “sex”, “gender”, “modifiable risk factors” and “prediabetes” as keywords. Reference list from identified studies was used to augment the search strategy. Methodological quality and results from individual studies were summarized in tables.
Results
Gender differences in the risk factor association were observed among reviewed studies. Overall, reported association between risk factors and prediabetes apparently stronger among men. In particular, abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, smoking and alcohol drinking habits were risk factors that showed prominent association among men. Hypertension and poor diet quality may appear to be stronger among women. General obesity showed stringent hold, while physical activity not significantly associated with the risk of prediabetes in both the genders.
Conclusions
Evidence suggests the existence of gender differences in risk factors associated with prediabetes, demands future researchers to analyze data separately based on gender. The consideration and the implementation of gender differences in health policies and in diabetes prevention programs may improve the quality of care and reduce number of diabetes prevalence among prediabetic subjects."

Intra-abdominal adipose tissue (IAAT) is a major contributor to insulin resistance (IR) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Prior studies have demonstrated evidence of IR in fibrocalculous pancreatic diabetes (FCPD). However, no data exists on IAAT estimation in FCPD. Hence, we compared IAAT area among FCPD patients and an equal number of body mass index (BMI) matched T2D patients and healthy controls.
Methods
We recruited 60 patients with FCPD between January 2019 and February 2020. Body composition analysis was performed via bio-electrical impedance analysis.
Results
The mean ages were 37.82 ± 10.07, 51.02 ± 9.9, and 30.7 ± 11.51 years for patients in the FCPD, T2D, and control groups, respectively.

Many patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have comorbidities related to metabolic syndrome (MS) during the disease course. Its presence in different ethnicities and continents places MS as an important risk factor for COVID-19. Adequate understanding of the interplay between MS, COVID-19 and proposed therapies is required for optimum management of these patients.
Methods
We systematically searched the PubMed and Google Scholar databases until June 1st, 2020 and accessed the full text on COVID-19 and MS to prepare a narrative review on this topic.
Results
Patients with metabolic disorders like obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular and liver disease may face a higher risk of infection of COVID-19, greatly affecting the development and prognosis of the disease, being associated with significantly worse outcome in these patients. The proposed drugs that are in clinical trial for COVID-19 treatment must be carefully considered for clinical use, especially in patients with MS.
Conclusion
MS is a risk factor influencing the progression and prognosis of COVID-2019. The drugs currently evaluated for the infection treatment are promising but need further studies to prove their efficacy and safety, due to the adverse effects may be exacerbated by combination therapy or due to viral infection. The development of a vaccine for immunization is still the best long-term solution."

Metabolic Syndrome (MS) is increasing in developing countries. Different definitions of MS lead to discrepancies in prevalence estimates and applicability. We assessed the prevalence of MS as defined by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), modified National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Plan III (Modified NCEP) and Joint Interim Statement (JIS); compared the diagnostic performance and association of these definitions of MS with pre-diabetes, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.
Methods
A total of 714 randomly selected subjects from Northeastern Brazil were investigated in a cross-sectional study. Sociodemographic, anthropometric, and clinical data were recorded. Diagnostic test performance measures assessed the ability of the different MS definitions to identify those with pre-diabetes, T2DM and increased CVD risk.
Results
The adjusted prevalence of MS was 36.1% applying the JIS criteria, 35.1% the IDF and 29.5% Modified NCEP. Women were more affected by MS according to all definitions. MS was significantly associated with pre-diabetes, T2DM and CVD risk following the three definitions. However, the JIS and IDF definitions showed higher sensitivity than the Modified NCEP to identify pre-diabetes, T2DM and CVD risk. The odds ratios for those conditions were not significantly different when comparing the definitions.
Conclusions
MS is highly prevalent in Brazil, particularly among those with pre-diabetes, T2DM, and high CVD risk. The IDF and JIS criteria may be better suited in the Brazilian population to identify pre-diabetes, T2DM and CVD risk. This may also signify the importance of the assessment of MS in clinical practice."

A literature survey was conducted using Scopus, PubMed and Google Scholar with the search key as: coronavirus vaccine, SARS vaccine, MERS vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine. Articles related to above search query were retrieved, sorted, analyzed and developed into an easy-to-understand review.
Results
The genome phylogenetic analysis suggested that genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is almost 80% similar to that of SARS-CoV, further both these viruses bind to same host cell receptor ACE-2. Hence it is expected that, previously available literature data about coronavirus vaccine designing may play crucial role in development of rapid vaccine against COVID-19. In view of this, the present review discuss (i) existing information (from 2003 to present) about the type of vaccine, antigen, immunogenic response, animal model, route of administration, adjuvants and current scenario for designing of coronavirus vaccine (ii) potential factors and challenges related to rapid development of COVID-19 vaccine.

The patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) have an increased incidence of both common and unusual infections. Despite an increasing prevalence of DM in India, local data on the epidemiology and clinical spectrum of associated infections are lacking. We aimed to investigate the spectrum, etiology, and outcome of infectious disorders in adult patients with DM admitted in a medical emergency.
Methods
A single-center retrospective observational study conducted between January 2018 to June 2019 in a tertiary care hospital in north India. Based on clinical presentation, radiological features, and microbiological or pathological evidence, 152 diabetic patients aged 12 years and above were diagnosed with the infectious syndrome.
Results
Urinary tract infection was the most prevalent infectious syndrome (32.2%), followed by pneumonia and empyema (26.3%), skin and soft tissue infections (6.6%), sepsis of unknown primary source (6.6%), pulmonary tuberculosis (4.6%), rhinocerebral infections (4.6%), infectious diarrhea (3.9%), and viral encephalitis (2.6%). The majority of the infections were community-acquired (94.7%). 80.3% of study cases had type 2 DM. The common presenting symptoms were fever (46.1%), dyspnea (27.6%), and altered sensorium (25.7%). Shock and diabetic ketoacidosis were frequent, and each was seen in 27.6% of cases. The mortality rate was 27.6% and was higher with sepsis of unrecognized source (50.0%) and lung infections (30.0%). The presence of shock was the independent predictor of mortality on a multivariant analysis (p-value 0.000).
Conclusions
Urinary tract and lung infections remain common in DM. Establishing a microbiological etiology and identification of the source are necessary steps to reduce mortality."

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has immensely strained healthcare systems worldwide. Diabetes has emerged as a major comorbidity in a large proportion of patients infected with COVID-19 and is associated with poor health outcomes. We aim to provide a practical guidance on screening of hyperglycemia in persons without known diabetes in low resource settings.
Methods
We reviewed the available guidelines on this subject and proposed an algorithm based on simple measures of blood glucose (BG) which can be implemented by healthcare workers with lesser expertise in low resource settings.
Results
We propose that every hospitalized patient with COVID-19 infection undergo a paired capillary BG assessment (pre-meal and 2-h post-meal). Patients with pre-meal BG < 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) and post-meal BG < 10.0 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) may not merit further monitoring. On the other hand, those with one or more value above these thresholds should undergo capillary BG monitoring (pre-meals and 2 hours after dinner) for the next 24 hours. When two or more (≥50%) such values are significantly elevated [pre-meal ≥8.3 mmol/L (150 mg/dL) and post-meal ≥11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL)], pharmacotherapy should be immediately initiated. On the other hand, in patients with modest elevation of one or more values [pre-meal 7.8–8.3 mmol/L (140–150 mg/dL) and post-meal 10.0–11.1 mmol/L (180–200 mg/dL)], dietary modifications should be initiated and pharmacotherapy considered only if BG control remains suboptimal.
Conclusion
We highlight strategies for screening of hyperglycemia in persons without known diabetes treated for COVID-19 infection in low resource settings. This guidance may well be applied to other settings in the near future."

Today, it has been shown that diabetes mellitus (DM) can affect male fertility. Glucose metabolism is a vital process in spermatogenesis that is impacted by diabetes condition. But the mechanisms by which DM causes male infertility are not wholly clarified. The aim of this review is to provide brief information about the influence of hyperglycemia on male fertility and specific emphasis on the molecular signaling pathway that is involved.
Methods
Broad literature search in the electronic database “Pubmed”, “Google Scholar”, the website of “World Health Organization” (WHO) and Control Disease and Prevention (CDC) took place. There was no time restriction. A key criterion for the selection of articles was English and language. Finally, one hundred thirty seven articles were included in the review.
Results
Diabetes mellitus affects many signaling pathways that involved in the spermatogenesis. It seems that increased ROS and oxidative stress in the diabetes is the beginning of all fertility problems and affects all of involved signaling pathways in the spermatogenesis.
Conclusions
It seems that there was strong interconnected between oxidative stress and all of involved signaling pathways in the reproductive problems in diabetes. So, approaches that diminish oxidative stress in the testis can be effective in improving diabetes related infertility complications."

Insulin resistance (IR) plays a great role in type 1 diabetes (T1DM) disease process than is commonly recognized. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is an enzyme that deactivates many bioactive peptides involved in glucose regulation.
Aims
This study evaluates DPP-4 level in adolescent patients with T1DM compared to controls and investigates the relationship between DPP-4 level and IR in these patients.
Materials and methods
We measured serum DPP-4 level in 50 patients with T1DM recruited from the Diabetes Endocrine Metabolism Pediatric Unit, and in 80 healthy controls. IR was assessed by the equation for estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR). Biochemical evaluation including glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C) and lipid profile were included.
Results
IR was found in 80% of patients with T1DM. DPP-4 was significantly higher in control group than patients with T1DM. Patients with T1DM were classified into 3 groups according to DPP-4 tertiles showing significant increase in BMI SDS and total cholesterol across the 3 groups. Significant correlation was found between DPP-4 levels and insulin dose. DPP-4 was significantly higher in patients with T1DM with good glycemic control.
Conclusion
In sample of individuals researched by us, serum DPP-4 was related to adiposity and not to the hyperglycemia in patients with T1DM. Larger sample should be researched to make firm conclusions."

Cholesterol and ketone bodies are synthesized in liver from a common precursor acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). Statins by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis may lead to accumulation of acetyl-CoA in hepatocytes and its diversion towards ketogenesis. Ketone bodies may act as alternative energy source thus sparing blood glucose and contributing to hyperglycemia. The present study aims to assess the effect of Atorvastatin therapy on blood ketone levels and glycemic control in patients with T2DM.
Methods
Study included 24 statin naïve subjects with T2DM. They were prescribed tablet Atorvastatin at dose of 10 mg once daily at bedtime. Ongoing anti-diabetic medications were not changed. Estimation of blood ketones, urine ketones, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), post-prandial plasma glucose (PPG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and lipid parameters was carried out at baseline and at 3 months after starting Atorvastatin.
Results
There was moderate but significant increase in blood ketones (0.16 ± 0.08 mmol/L vs. 0.26 ± 0.07 mmol/L; p-value = 0.0000), FPG (133.8 ± 17.91 mg/dL vs. 143.3 ± 22.99 mg/dL; p-value = 0.0016) and PPG (193.0 ± 36.54 mg/dL vs. 211.0 ± 49.51 mg/dL; p-value = 0.0344) after 3 months of Atorvastatin therapy. This was associated with significant reduction in serum total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol.
Conclusion
Three months therapy with Atorvastatin at the dose of 10 mg once daily at bedtime in patients with T2DM resulted in moderate rise in blood ketone levels, FPG and PPG in addition to improvement in lipid parameters."

The management of diabetes has become a challenge due to the COVID 19 lockdown. An online-based pilot survey was conducted to study how people with diabetes were coping with their Diabetes during the COVID - 19 lockdown.
Method
The questions were designed in an online survey, Survey Monkey, to conduct this cross-sectional study. The link was generated and sent to 100 registered patients of the MV Hospital for Diabetes Royapuram who had not contacted the hospital after the lockdown announcement. The survey was done between April 1 and April 15, 2020.Oral consent was obtained through telephone before the link was sent by Whatsapp to them.The questionnaire consisted of questions on home blood glucose monitoring, regularity in doing their physical activity and dietary compliance and anxiety about the viral infection.
Results
92% of the participants had Type 2 diabetes. Only 28% of the participants were checking their blood glucose levels regularly. 80% of the participants mentioned that they were following regular exercise and diet control during the lockdown period. 40% of the participants were anxious about the Covid infection.

abstract = "Background and aims
Obesity is a worldwide pandemic with multiple consequences including kidney affection. This study aimed to assess the effects of obesity on renal functions and to detect the most reliable formula of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in morbidly obese patients.
Methods
A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted on 82 morbidly obese patients. Anthropometric measurements were done for all patients and body adiposity (BAI) and visceral adiposity (VAI) indices were calculated after assessment of abdominal fat tissue analysis by computerized tomography (CT). Serum creatinine was incorporated into six different formulae of eGFR, then eGFR was compared with the 24-h measured creatinine clearance (CLcr) values.
Results
The mean body mass index was 55.8 ± 9.5 kg/m2. Proteinuria and glomerular hyperfiltration (CLcr > 130 ml/min/1.73 m2) were detected in 68.3% and 91.5% of the patients, respectively. Cockcroft–Gault formula using total (CCG-TBW-eGFR) and adjusted body water (CCG-AjBW-eGFR) had the nearest values to measured CLCr. These two formulae had a moderate reliability and the lowest percentage of error (30% and 23%, respectively). Visceral and total abdominal fat tissue surface area and volume assessed by CT were directly correlated to the 24-h urinary protein excretion (r = 0.32, 0.24, 0.37 and 0.34, respectively; p = 0.02, 0.03, 0.004 and 0.002, respectively).
Conclusions
Glomerular hyperfiltration and proteinuria are highly prevalent in morbidly obese patients. There is no ideal formula for GFR estimation in morbidly obese patients, however, TBW and AjBW incorporated into the Cockcroft–Gault can be helpful in those patients."

Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and depression occur comorbidly and share some pathophysiological mechanisms. The course of depression in patients with the two conditions is severe. Treatment of depression in diabetic patients requires special attention because most of psychopharmacological agents can worsen glycemic control. This article aims to review studies evaluating the antidepressant effect of anti-hyperglycemic agents from preclinical perspective.
Methods
A literature search was performed with PubMed and Google Scholar using relevant keywords (antidiabetic; diabetes; depression; antidepressant; animals) to extract relevant studies evaluating the antidepressant activity of anti-hyperglycemic agents in experimental models.
Results
Several studies have reported that some traditional anti-hyperglycemic agents reduce depression-like behavior in the absence or presence of diabetes. These drugs include insulin, glyburide, metformin, pioglitazone, vildagliptin, liraglutide, and exenatide. The antidepressant activity of anti-hyperglycemic agents may be mediated by reducing the blood glucose level, ameliorating the central oxidative stress and inflammation, and regulating the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPAA).
Conclusions
Drugs which have both antidiabetic and antidepressant activities can provide better treatment strategy for patients with diabetes-associated depression. However, further research studies are still required in human subjects."

The current study attempts to model the COVID-19 outbreak in India, USA, China, Japan, Italy, Iran, Canada and Germany. The interactions of coronavirus transmission with socio-economic factors in India using the multivariate approach were also investigated.
Methods
Actual cumulative infected population data from 15 February to May 15, 2020 was used for determination of parameters of a nested exponential statistical model, which were further employed for the prediction of infection. Correlation and Principal component analysis provided the relationships of coronavirus spread with socio-economic factors of different states of India using the Rstudio software.
Results
Cumulative infection and spreadability rate predicted by the model was in good agreement with the actual observed data for all countries (R2 = 0.985121 to 0.999635, and MD = 1.2–7.76%) except Iran (R2 = 0.996316, and MD = 18.38%). Currently, the infection rate in India follows an upward trajectory, while other countries show a downward trend. The model claims that India is likely to witness an increased spreading rate of COVID-19 in June and July. Moreover, the flattening of the cumulative infected population is expected to be obtained in October infecting more than 12 lakhs people. Indian states with higher population were more susceptible to virus infection.
Conclusions
A long-term prediction of cumulative cases, spreadability rate, pandemic peak of COVID-19 was made for India. Prediction provided by the model considering most recent data is useful for making appropriate interventions to deal with the rapidly emerging pandemic."

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and its risk factors are increasing worldwide and in India. Controlling the rise in risk factors at present is crucial to prevent NCD surge in future. Current study was conducted to estimate the burden of clustering of NCD risk factors among adult population (18–69 years) residing in selected villages of rural Bengaluru, Karnataka
Methods
Population based screening for NCD risk factors were carried out among adults in rural Bengaluru during May to October 2019. NCD risk factors were screened using WHO STEPwise approach to chronic disease risk factor surveillance (STEPs) instrument and Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) NCD risk factor tool. Presence of three or more risk factors in same individual was considered as presence of clustering of NCD risk factors. Additional analysis was done for clustering of NCD risk factors with different number of risk factors.
Results
Prevalence of clustering of NCD risk factors in rural adult population was as follows; ≥2 risk factors 81.0%, ≥3 risk factors 56.3%, ≥4 risk factors 33.6%, ≥5 risk factors 14.5% and ≥6 risk factors 4.8%. The most common NCD risk factors were inadequate intake of fruits and vegetables (82.3%), physical inactivity (46.8%) and central obesity (46.4%). Clustering NCD risk factors were significantly associated with increased age, males and lower levels of education.
Conclusions
High burden of clustering of risk factor indicates the need for health policies with integrated NCD risk factors prevention strategies than targeted approach. Awareness regarding the effect of clustering needs to be increased among the primary care physicians practising in rural areas."

abstract = "Background and Aim
The present study compared cardiovascular autonomic activity and reactivity during fasting (FS) and hyperglycemia (HS) states in young healthy females.
Methods
This case crossover study was conducted on 30 females recruited by convenient sampling. Blood glucose levels were measured in FS and after oral glucose load i.e., HS. Finger arterial blood pressure (BP) and ECG were recorded constantly to monitor baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS) and heart rate variability (HRV). Autonomic reactivity was tested with deep breathing (DB), Valsalva manoeuvre (VM), and head-up-tilt (HUT) test under FS and HS. HRV parameters not normally distributed were natural log (ln) transformed.
Results
Significantly reduced Valsalva ratio and higher heart rate and BP were observed in HS that continued during HUT (P < 0.05). The lnSDNN (standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals) and lnRMSSD (root mean square of successive differences) were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in HS during HUT. After HUT, lnRMSSD remained lower (P = 0.031), whereas lnLF/HF (low frequency/high frequency power) ratio (P = 0.042) and LFnu (normalized units) (P = 0.024) were higher in HS. BRS was significantly lower in supine position in HS compared to FS and further reduced in HUT position in both FS and HS (P < 0.05).
Conclusion
Compared to FS, the HS exhibited heightened sympathetic activity with attenuation of parasympathetic activity and this phenomenon was further accentuated by HUT. BRS was more sensitive indicator of autonomic effects of hyperglycemia in resting state. In addition to standard tests, autonomic reactivity in vulnerable young subjects could be useful to detect autonomic imbalance at an early stage."

Sedentary behavior and/or physical inactivity are modifiable risk factors for noncommunicable diseases. Myokines are one of the mediators of physical activity health benefits. Relationship between regular physical activity (RPA) and baseline plasma Meteorin-Like Hormone (Metrnl) has not been explored in human. Hence, we compared baseline plasma Metrnl between sedentary individuals and ones with recreational physical activities, and role of Metrnl as a biological messenger between physical activity and insulin resistance and body composition was also explored.
Methods
Forty healthy young men (aged: 21 ± 2.1 yrs; BMI: 23 ± 3.44 kg/m2) completed the study. Participants were equally assigned into two groups of control (sedentary) and case (recreational athletes). Baseline plasma Metrnl, glucose, insulin and body composition components and insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) were assessed under resting conditions.
Results
Except for baseline blood glucose, baseline plasma Metrnl, insulin, HOMA-IR and body mass index and body fat percentage were similar between two groups (P > 0.05). However, after Metrnl correction for the degree of insulin resistance index (Metrnl/HOMA-IR), recreational athletes showed a significantly greater baseline compared to sedentary subjects (P < 0.05). Baseline blood glucose showed a negative and significant correlation with baseline plasma Metrnl (P < 0.05).
Conclusions
Baseline plasma Metrnl is correlated with regular physical activity and insulin sensitivity, but not with body composition parameters. Metrnl may be one possible mediator of the beneficial effects of PA on insulin sensitivity in healthy humans. Hence, increasing awareness of the benefits of physical activity and incorporating physical activity into lifestyle are of great importance for people with non-communicable diseases."

After the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the last two decades, the world is facing its new challenge in SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with unfathomable global responses. The characteristic clinical symptoms for Coronavirus (COVID-19) affected patients are high fever, dry-cough, dyspnoea, lethal pneumonia whereas some patients also show additional neurological signs such as headache, nausea, vomiting etc. The accumulative evidences suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is not only confined within the respiratory tract but may also invade the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) inducing some fatal neurological diseases. Here, we analyze the phylogenetic perspective of SARS-CoV-2 with other strains of β-Coronaviridae from a standpoint of neurological spectrum disorders.
Methodology
A Pubmed/Medline, NIH Lit Covid, Cochrane library and some open data bases (BioRxiv, MedRxiv,preprint.org and others) search were carried out by using keywords relevant to our topic of discussion. The extracted literatures are scrutinized by the authors.
Results
58 literatures including original articles, case reports and case series were selected by the authors to analyze the differential distribution of neurological impairments in COVID-19 positive patients along with angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) expression dynamics in neuronal and non-neuronal tissue in CNS and PNS with neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV2.
Conclusion
We discuss the need for modulations in clinical approach from a neurological point of view, as a measure towards reducing disease transmission, morbidity and mortality in SARS-CoV2 positive patients."

To conduct a systematic and critical review of published studies on prevalence of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in urban and rural areas of India.
Methods
We conducted a literature search in PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science using the terms ‘prevalence’, ‘Type 2 diabetes, ‘India’, ‘urban’ and ‘rural’ for English language articles published during January 1994–December 2018. We selected articles that reported the results of original studies that randomly sampled adults aged 15–80 years, and which reported T2DM prevalence based on the actual examination of blood samples.
Results
Of 1751 articles screened by titles and abstracts, 37 fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Majority (28 of 37; 76%) of studies were from South India, especially from the states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Karnataka. The prevalence of T2DM showed a wide range from 1.9% to 25.2%. Only 11 studies covering 24 regions separately reported the data by urban or rural location. Albeit inconsistent, 17 studies reported prevalence of T2DM by age group.
Conclusion
In this systematic review, we show that there remains an ambiguity about the actual prevalence of T2DM from India due to several factors. The findings underscore a strong need for having periodic regional surveillance involving appropriate epidemiological methods."

Blood glucose monitoring is very important for individuals with diabetes due to its rate determining role in medication strength adjustment and observation of possible life-threatening hypoglycemia. Possible non-invasive devices can overcome some of these burdens and could increase adherence towards checking blood glucose.
Methods
Data extraction methods were primarily based through various PubMed scholarly articles for real-world examples of non-invasive approaches. Additional articles were used in adjust as supplementary to the PubMed articles.
Results
Non-invasive technology is being heavily researched and could create a new market that could offer novel options for blood glucose monitoring at home. The lack of adherence for blood glucose monitoring may be tied to current blood glucose monitoring devices, which require invasive procedures that are often painful and expensive to acquire. Certain non-invasive devices have and are being developed for accurately assessing the blood glucose levels of individuals when compared to current blood glucose monitoring devices.
Conclusion
Blood glucose monitoring is very important for the health and safety of individuals with diabetes. It is important to consider the direct problems that may occur from the lack of adherence to blood glucose monitoring and propose options to help reduce the issues associated with current devices. Different non-invasive technologies can tailor to the needs of patients with diabetes based on the body target that is used for detection. Further research may be needed to help improve the specificity and sensitivity of certain technologies."

The present study aimed to observe the effect of sertraline in newly diagnosed depression patients with T2DM or HTN.
Methods
A prospective, observational study was conducted in the T2DM or HTN patients who were newly diagnosed as depression patients. Parameters such as, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) score for depression were measured before and after initiating sertraline therapy (50 mg, twice daily). Paired t-test was used to find out the statistical significance.
Result
Of the 546 enrolled patients, 291 patients were in T2DM and 255 patients with HTN. No statistically significant difference (p > 0.05) was observed between baseline and 12th week of comparison with respect to HbA1c, SBP and DBP values. While at the end of treatment, the number of patients suffered from depression in severe state were improved to moderate to a mild state of depression. Statistically significant difference (p < 0.001) was observed in both T2DM and HTN groups when comparing the total score of HAM-D before and after sertraline treatment.
Conclusion
Sertraline is effective in the management of newly diagnosed depression among T2DM or HTN patients. However, the results should be confirmed by a double blinded placebo studies."

Metabolic syndrome is the concurrent presentation of multiple cardiovascular risk factors, including obesity, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and hypertension. It has been suggested that some of these risk factors can have detrimental effects on the skeletal muscle while others can be a direct result of skeletal muscle abnormalities, showing a two-way directionality in the pathogenesis of the condition. This review aims to explore this bidirectional correlation by discussing the impact of metabolic syndrome on skeletal muscle tissue in general and will also discuss ways in which skeletal muscle alterations may contribute to the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome.
Methods
Literature searches were conducted with key words (e.g. metabolic syndrome, skeletal muscle, hyperglycemia) using PubMed, EBSCOhost, Science Direct and Google Scholar. All article types were included in the search.
Results
The pathological mechanisms associated with metabolic syndrome, such as hyperglycemia and inflammation, have been associated with changes in skeletal muscle fiber composition, metabolism, insulin sensitivity, mitochondrial function, and strength. Additionally, some skeletal muscle alterations, particularly mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance, are suggested to contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome. For example, the suggested underlying mechanisms of sarcopenia development are also contributors to metabolic syndrome pathogenesis.
Conclusion
Whilst numerous studies have identified a relationship between metabolic syndrome and skeletal muscle abnormalities, further investigation into the underlying mechanisms is needed to elucidate the best prevention and management strategies for these conditions."

Overweight and obesity are thought to be associated with increased risk of chronic disease in the Middle East. The present study aimed to determine the association between dietary habits and the incidence of overweight and obesity in urban adult population in the central part of Iran after a 10-year follow-up.
Methods
This cohort study was initiated with 2000 participation aged 20–74 years from Yazd city in Iran based on Yazd Healthy Heart Project (YHHP). The participants without overweight and obesity at the baseline of the study were followed up to 10 years. Demographic data, anthropometric measurements, behavioral and metabolic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases and dietary habits were assessed at baseline and phase II.
Results
After a 10-year follow up, 516 non-overweight and 1068 non-obese participants were included for the final analysis. Once adjustments were made for all potential confounders including age, sex, smoking, economic status, physical activity and education, it was identified that lack of weight control increased the risk of obesity (hazard ratio; 95% CI) in total population (1.9; 1.06, 3.4), as well as the risk of overweight (2.39; 1.07, 5.27) and obesity (2.65; 1.13, 6.25) in men. Moreover, consumption of mayonnaise increased the 10-year risk of overweight in women (6.09; 1.2, 30.99).
Conclusions
As revealed by the present study, unhealthy dietary habits can increase the incidence of overweight and obesity in central part of Iran. Therefore, changing the lifestyle appears to be urgent in reducing the risk of overweight and obesity."

COVID-19 pandemic has affected various countries differently due to variance in demographics, income level, health infrastructure, government response, control and enforcement, and cultural traits of different populations. This study aims to identify significant factors behind the unequal distribution of identified cases and deaths in different countries. Our study’s objective is comparative analysis and identification of relations between the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, population characteristics, and government response.
Methods
The top 18 countries worst hit by COVID-19 cases were identified. The data metrics, such as the number of cases, deaths, fatality rates, tests, average life expectancy, and population, were collected and consolidated.
Results
Countries with significant percentage of the older population are vulnerable to a high number of deaths due to COVID-19. Developed countries have higher per capita testing, whereas testing is less intensive in developing/underdeveloped countries. There is a consensus among health experts that COVID-19 has higher fatality rates for people above 60, however, with further age, this increases exponentially. Countries with higher life expectancy are also high-income countries, and the best course of action would be to provide specialized support to self-isolate for people of ages 75 and above.
Conclusion
The behaviour of disease occurring at a large scale and interaction with different populations is studied to understand and differentiate the factors and measures that successfully inhibited the pandemic. The study benchmarks different countries based on their performance and efforts against the pandemic and provides some useful insights on the efficiency of their governance and potential to improve & ramp up their programs. The economic status and existing healthcare infrastructure as they are the key factors in determining the country’s ability to contain and minimize the losses from this pandemic."

abstract = "Background and aims
New clinical approaches are needed to minimize complications of gestational diabetes during the COVID-19 outbreak with timely screening and proper management. The present study aims to highlight changes in the clinical guideline for gestational diabetes during the pandemic.
Methods
In a narrative review, multiple databases were searched. Furthermore, online searches were conducted to identify guidelines or support documents provided by NGOs, local health authorities, and societies and organizations in the field of diabetes and obstetrics.
Results
We included five national guidelines that were published in English from Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Australia health agencies. FBG, A1C, RPG were recommended as alternative tests instead of a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGGT) for GDM screening at 24–28 weeks of gestation. Recommendations also included a deferral of postpartum screening till the end of the pandemic, or postponement of testing to 6–12 months after delivery, use telemedicine and telecare.
Conclusions
Updated temporary changes in clinical guidelines are sensible and accommodates social distancing and minimizes risk of exposure to COVID-19. Despite many unsolved controversies in screening, treatment, and follow-up of gestational diabetes, it seems involvement with novel coronavirus have made a reach to a global agreement simpler."

abstract = "Background and aims
Diabetic foot ulcers are the leading cause of lower extremity amputations, which require more effective prevention. Even though previous nursing studies on diabetic foot ulcers have been well performed, programs implementing self- and family management are limited and even underexplored. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of 3-month self- and family management support programs on clinical outcomes among Indonesians with diabetic foot ulcers.
Method
The randomized controlled trial design was used to answer the research question of the study. A total of 56 eligible participants were enrolled, with 27 in the experimental group and 29 in the control group. The experimental group received self- and family management support programs for three months. Meanwhile, the control group received usual care. Descriptive statistics, multivariate analysis of variance, and Generalized Estimating Equations were used to analyze the data. The significance level was considered at .05 for hypothesis testing.
Results
The study showed that there were statistically significant improvements in self-management, family supports, hemoglobin A1c, and wound size after implemented the programs for three months (p < .05).
Conclusions
With regard to the result of the study, implementing the 3-month self- and family management support programs improves the patients’ and families’ abilities to perform diabetic foot ulcer care at home."

abstract = "Background
and Aims; To investigate the association between use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) and outcomes of hypertensive COVID-19 patients, a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed.
Methods
We systematically searched PubMed, EuropePMC, ProQuest, and Cochrane Central Databases using the terms “(COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2) AND (angiotensin converting enzyme OR angiotensin receptor blocker)”. The primary and second outcomes were mortality (non-survivor) and severe COVID-19, respectively.
Results
Totally, 7410 patients were included from 15 studies. Pooled analysis showed that the use of ACEI/ARB was not associated with mortality (OR 0.73 [0.38, 1.40], p = 0.34; I2: 81%) and severity (OR 1.03 [0.73, 1.45], p = 0.87; I2: 65%). Pooled adjusted OR showed no risk/benefit associated with ACEI/ARB use in terms of mortality (OR 0.83 [0.54, 1.27], p = 0.38; I2: 0%). Subgroup analysis showed that the use of ARB was associated with reduced mortality (OR 0.51 [0.29, 0.90], p = 0.02; I2: 22%) but not ACEI subgroup (OR 0.68 [0.39, 1.17], p = 0.16; I2: 0%). Meta-regression showed that the association between ACEI/ARB use and mortality in patients with COVID-19 do not varies by gender (p = 0.104). GRADE showed a very low certainty of evidence for effect of ACEI/ARB on mortality and severity. The certainty of evidence was very low for both ACEI and ARB subgroups.
Conclusion
Administration of a renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor, was not associated with increased mortality or severity of COVID-19 in patients with hypertension. Specifically, ARB and not ACEI use, was associated with lower mortality."

Short stature has been linked with the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, only one study has been conducted in Latin American adults. We aimed to assess the association between short stature and MetS in workers of a private educational institution in Peru. In addition, we evaluated the association between height and surrogate markers of insulin resistance (IR).
Methods
We performed an analytical cross-sectional study. We categorized the height in tertiles and evaluated MetS according to the Latin American Diabetes Association statement. We used the triglycerides and glucose (TyG) index and the triglycerides to HDL-cholesterol (TG/HDL-c) ratio as IR markers. We elaborated crude and adjusted Poisson generalized linear models to evaluate the association between height tertiles and MetS. For the IR markers, we carried out crude and adjusted linear regressions.
Results
We analyzed 1080 participants and the overall prevalence of MetS was 16.2%. In the adjusted Poisson generalized linear model, using the high tertile as a reference, we found statistically significant differences in the prevalence of MetS with the low and intermediate tertile (aPR = 2.03; 95%CI: 1.48–2.77 and aPR = 1.41; 95%CI: 1.01–1.99; respectively). In the gender-stratified analysis, we found statistical significance between height and MetS when comparing high and low tertile for both genders. For IR markers, we found an inverse association between the height and TyG index (aβ = −0.14; 95%CI: 0.19 to −0.10) and TG/HDL-c ratio (aβ = −0.62; 95%CI: 0.84 to −0.39). When we stratified by gender, the association for both secondary outcomes and height remained statistically significant in both groups.
Conclusions
We found an association between short stature and the prevalence of MetS and IR markers. We need studies with national representative samples to define the threshold of short stature with better sensitivity and specificity for the screening of MetS."

During the current pandemic of COVID-19, India is under lockdown which could cause disruption in diet and lifestyle in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). We aimed to study lifestyle changes and other common issues related to treatment in our previously seen and treated patients with T2DM.
Methods
Patients (n, 150) who were regularly following up before lockdown were interviewed telephonically (after 45 days of start of lockdown) regarding lifestyle changes, stress and other diabetes-related questions.
Result
Carbohydrate consumption and frequency of snacking increased in 21% and 23% patients, respectively. Interestingly, 27% patients reported an increase in consumption of fruits. Exercise duration was reduced in 42% and weight gain occurred in 19% patients. Frequency of doing self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) was decreased in 23% patients. ‘Mental stress’ of any kind was reported in 87% patients. Availability of medicines and insulin was uninterrupted in 91% patients. Knowledge about telemedicine was present in 69% and majority (92%) of these patients preferred video consultation.
Conclusion
During 45 days of lockdown increase in carbohydrate intake, decrease in exercise, decreased SMBG and widespread mental stress in patients with T2DM was recorded, factors which may destabilize or exacerbate hyperglycemia and hypertension. Some positive changes (e.g. increased intake of fruits) were also observed."

Diabetes is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recent studies have demonstrated that nutraceutical products have beneficial effects in diabetes. Present study aims to investigate whether a product (Lysulin™) containing amino acid lysine, micronutrient zinc and vitamin C will have beneficial effects in pre-diabetes.
Methods
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted for a period of 6 months. The two parallel groups (1:1) were Lysulin™ (Interventional group–IG) and placebo (control group–CG). Evaluations were done at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months. Primary outcome was defined as change in glycaemic control measured by HbA1c from baseline. Other outcomes included change in; fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h OGTT plasma glucose and lipid profile from baseline. Three multiple regression analyses were performed, where change in FPG, 2-h OGTT, and HbA1c post intervention from baseline respectively were the continuous dependent variable with other independent variables.
Results
One hundred and ten participants were recruited, 50% (n = 55) were males and mean age (±SD) was 46.7 ± 9.9 years. A significantly higher percentage of participants in CG (25.4%, n = 14) developed diabetes in comparison to IG (7.3%, n = 4) (p = 0.018). FPG, 2-h OGTT and HbA1c significantly reduced in the IG only. Both total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol decreased significantly from baseline only in the IG. In all three regression models the best predictor of respective dependent variable was Lysulin™ treatment.
Conclusions
Lysulin™ improved glycaemic control, with reduced progression to diabetes, in those with pre-diabetes. Treatment also showed a beneficial reduction in total and LDL cholesterol levels.

On March 11, 2020, the novel coronavirus was declared a global pandemic. The disease was named COVID-19 standing for coronavirus disease 2019. The objectives were to determine the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients.
Methods
In this prospective descriptive study, 15 confirmed hospitalized cases of COVID-19 between 18th March and April 7, 2020 were followed-up till discharge.
Results
There were 15 reported patients infected by 3 imported index cases from Europe. The mean age of the patients was 28.06 (SD: 16.42 years). The patients’ age stratification was as follows: 0–5 (2, 13.3%); 6–18 (2, 13.3); 19–50 (10, 66.7%), and 51–64 years (1, 6.7%). The patients were male (9, 60.0%) and female (6, 40.0%). Most of the patients had mild disease severity (13, 86.7%), followed by mild-moderate (1, 6.7%) and moderate-severe (1, 6.7%). The study revealed that 6 patients were asymptomatic, and 9 patients were symptomatic. The most common symptoms were: fever (n = 8; 53.3%), cough (n = 7; 46.7%), shortness of breath (n = 3; 20.0%), fatigue (n = 3; 20.0%), and taste and smell disorders (n = 4; 26.7%). All patients were recovered and discharged over a median of 8 between 8 and 21 days. The mean and Std. deviation values of the hematological were: WBC: 6.57 (1.86); neutrophil count: 3.75 (1.26); lymphocyte count: 1.87 (0.41); Hb: 13.89 (1.26); platelet count: 207.67 (52.21).
Conclusion
All COVID-19 cases were linked to foreign visits with few local transmissions to close contacts without community transmission. The majority of cases were mild illnesses with full recovery."

Covid-19 is a global pandemic that requires a global and integrated response of all national medical and healthcare systems. Covid-19 exposed the need for timely response and data sharing on fast spreading global pandemics. In this study, we investigate the scientific research response from the early stages of the pandemic, and we review key findings on how the early warning systems developed in previous epidemics responded to contain the virus.
Methods
We conducted data mining of scientific literature records from the Web of Science Core Collection, using the topics Covid-19, mortality, immunity, and vaccine. The individual records are analysed in isolation, and the analysis is compared with records on all Covid-19 research topics combined. The data records are analysed with commutable statistical methods, including R Studio’s Bibliometrix package, and the Web of Science data mining tool.
Results
From historical analysis of scientific data records on viruses, pandemics and mortality, we identified that Chinese universities have not been leading on these topics historically. However, during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Chinese universities are strongly dominating the research on these topics. Despite the current political and trade disputes, we found strong collaboration in Covid-19 research between the US and China. From the analysis on Covid-19 and immunity, we wanted to identify the relationship between different risk factors discussed in the news media. We identified a few clusters, containing references to exercise, inflammation, smoking, obesity and many additional factors. From the analysis on Covid-19 and vaccine, we discovered that although the USA is leading in volume of scientific research on Covid-19 vaccine, the leading 3 research institutions (Fudan, Melbourne, Oxford) are not based in the USA. Hence, it is difficult to predict which country would be first to produce a Covid-19 vaccine.
Conclusions
We analysed the conceptual structure maps with factorial analysis and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), and identified multiple relationships between keywords, synonyms and concepts, related to Covid-19 mortality, immunity, and vaccine development. We present integrated and corelated knowledge from 276 records on Covid-19 and mortality, 71 records on Covid-19 and immunity, and 189 records on Covid-19 vaccine."

Several commercially available phytosterol supplements are promoted for their cholesterol-lowering effects. However, limited information is available about their potential anti-hyperglycaemic effects. This study aimed to evaluate the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitory effects of phytosterol supplements in silico and in vitro to determine their potential for anti-diabetic activity.
Methods
Docking studies were carried out in silico to evaluate the potential for interactions between three major phytosterol compounds (stigmasterol, β-sitosterol, campesterol) and the DPP-4 enzyme, the enzyme that is inhibited by the anti-diabetic gliptins. Gas chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) was used to analyse three different supplements for phytosterol content. DPP-4 inhibitory activity was tested in vitro for these phytosterol supplements and two major phytosterol standards.
Results
In silico calculations predicted free binding energies for DPP-4 with the phytosterols to be: stigmasterol −8.78 kcal/mol; β-sitosterol −8.70 kcal/mol; campesterol −8.40 kcal/mol. These binding energies indicated a potential for significant DPP-4 inhibition. However, these results were not supported by the in vitro studies. Stigmasterol and β-sitosterol had an IC50 > 50 mg/ml (maximum tested concentration) and the Thompson's Cholesterol Manager® and Mega Strength Beta Sitosterol® supplements gave an IC50 > 100 mg/ml (maximum tested concentration). Blackmores Cholesterol Health® gave an IC50 value of 40 mg/ml which was attributed to β-carotene content.
Conclusions
Phytosterol supplements do not appear to offer any anti-diabetic activity potential via pathways that involve the inhibition of DPP-4."

abstract = "Background and aims
A variety of risk factors have been reported for the development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). But limited review on the role of antenatal perceived stress necessitated the design of the present study to evaluate the association between GDM and perceived stress during pregnancy.
Methods
A prospective case-control study was carried out among 100 GDM cases and 273 matched controls, attending regular antenatal clinic at two private hospitals of Karnataka. Data was collected by personal interviews using a standard questionnaire. Perceived stress was assessed using the Cohen 10-item Perceived Stress Scale. Score of ≥20 was identified as high stress. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 15 was used for analysis.
Results
Exposure rates for high maternal perceived stress among cases during pregnancy were noted. The odds of GDM were 13 folds higher among those with high antenatal stress (≥20) compared to those with low (<20) (p < 0.001) perceived stress. No correlation between maternal antenatal stress and blood glucose following OGTT was noted.
Conclusions
The study identified high perceived stress during pregnancy as a potential risk factor for GDM."

Anthropometric indices have been proposed for the early detection of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its risk factors. The present study aimed to determine optimal cutoff points for the Body Mass Index (BMI), Waist Circumference (WC), and Waist Hip Ratio (WHR) in the prediction of MetS.
Methods
This cross-sectional study was performed on 9746 adults 35–65 years, recruited in Ravansar Non-Communicable Diseases (RaNCD) cohort. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to compare the predictive validity and determine optimal cutoff values.
Results
The optimal cutoff points for BMI, WC and WHR were 27.3 kg/m2 (AUC: 78.6; 95%CI 77.1, 80.1), 97 cm (AUC: 63.8; 95%CI 60.4, 67.2) and 0.95 (AUC: 75.5; 95% CI 73.9, 77.1), respectively in men for the prediction of MetS.

Currently there is limited knowledge on medical comorbidities and COVID-19; we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of various morbidities on serious events in COVID 19.
Methods
PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials were searched on April 28, 2020, to extract published articles that reported the outcomes of COVID-19 patients. The search terms were “coronavirus” and “clinical characteristics”. ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, ARDS, Pneumonia, death was considered serious events. The comorbidities assessed in the study were Hypertension (HTN), Diabetes mellitus (DM), Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and Chronic Kidney disease (CKD). Subsequently, comparisons between comorbidity patient group and the non-comorbidity patient groups, in terms of serious events were made using the pooled estimates of odd’s ratio (OR)
Results
We identified 688 published results and 16 studies with 3994 patients were included in the systematic review. Serious events were seen in 526(13.16%) patients. Presence of hypertension with OR 2.95, diabetes mellitus with OR 3.07, Cardio vascular disease with OR 4.58, COPD with OR 6.66 and Chronic kidney disease with OR 5.32 had significant association in patients with COVID 19 on having serious events. Presence of diabetes mellitus (OR 2.78)) had a significant impact on death in COVID 19 patients with a p-value 0.004.
Conclusions
Presence of medical comorbidities in COVID-19 leads to higher risk of developing serious events i.e. ICU admission, mechanical intubation and mortality. The presence of Diabetes mellitus has a significant impact on mortality rate in COVID-19 patients."

Material methods
Baseline demographic and clinical data from 100 apparently non-diabetic household members (related or unrelated) of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were collected until 49 days of lockdown and analyzed using the XL-STAT statistical software. A two-pronged analytical strategy was employed. First, the metabolic risk profile related to age, sex, weight, family history, and exercise pattern was analyzed. This was followed by an assessment of the risk of developing type 2 diabetes using an established risk assessment engine.
Results
There was a trend towards weight gain seen in 40% of the cohort, with 16% of the population experiencing a 2.1–5 kg weight increment. When all the risk parameters were analyzed together using the ADA risk engine, there was an increase in the ADA diabetes risk score in 7% of the population, with 6.66% in the high-risk group. There was a further increase in weight among 3% of the population who were already obese at baseline.

2019-coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is causing insurmountable psychosocial impact on the whole mankind. Marginalized community, particularly those with substance use disorders (SUD), are particularly vulnerable to contract the infection and also likely to suffer from greater psychosocial burden. This article analyses the intricate bi-directional relationship between COVID-19 and addiction.
Methods
Pubmed and Google Scholar are searched with the following key terms- “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV2”, “Pandemic”, “Addiction”, “Opioid”, “Alcohol”, “Smoking”, “Addiction Psychiatry”, “Deaddiction”, “Substance use disorders”, “Behavioral addiction”. Few newspaper reports related to COVID-19 and addiction have also been added as per context.
Results
People with SUD are at greater risk of worse COVID-19 outcome. There is surge of addictive behaviors (both new and relapse) including behavioral addiction in this period. Withdrawal emergencies and death are also being increasingly reported. Addicted people are especially facing difficulties in accessing the healthcare services which are making them prone to procure drugs by illegal means.
Conclusion
COVID-19 and addiction are the two pandemics which are on the verge of collision causing major public health threat. While every effort must be taken to make the public aware of deleterious effects of SUD on COVID-19 prognosis, the resumption of deaddiction services and easier accessibility of prescription drugs are needs of the hour."

Methods
This was a cross sectional study carried out from May 2017 to October 2017 at the gynecology outpatient clinic of a tertiary care private hospital in Hyderabad, India. Eligible women diagnosed with PCOS according to Rotterdam criteria were enrolled. The primary outcome was the prevalence of MetS diagnosed by the modified NCEP ATP III criteria.
Results
The study comprised 382 patients with a mean age of 26.8 ± 5.3 years. MetS was present in 147 (38.5%) women with PCOS. The most frequently observed individual components of MetS were increased waist circumference and decreased HDL cholesterol. When predictors for MetS were analyzed by multivariate regression, BMI (aOR 1.14; 1.06–1.23; p ≪0.001) and age (aOR 1.12; 1.06–1.17; p ≪0.001) were significantly associated with MetS; however, the effect size was modest.
Conclusion
A high prevalence of MetS was observed in women with PCOS at this tertiary center in Hyderabad, with abdominal obesity and low HDL cholesterol as predominant components. We believe that universal screening of all PCOS women is a reasonable option."

abstract = "Background and aims
Overweight and obesity are important risk factors for chronic disorders. Fat accumulation is one of the central manifestations; it occurs via a complex mechanism where multiple metabolic signals converge. Sirtuins are an enzyme family with deacetylase functions that are implicated in the regulation of several genes. Sirt1 and its upstream regulator (miR-34a) are elements of a converging mechanism that integrates the dynamic metabolic state. In this work, we hypothesized that elevated levels of miR-34a in overweight/obese group inhibits Sirt1 activity. Therefore, we studied the miR-34a/Sirt1 axis in mononuclear cells obtained from adipose tissue.
Methods
Adipose tissue samples were collected from 36 subjects, and they were categorized according to body mass index (BMI) as overweight/obesity and normoweight. Subcutaneous adipose tissue samples were enzymatically dissociated, and mononuclear cells from adipose tissue were isolated by Ficoll Hypaque. Sirt1-positive cells and relative Sirt1 expression were determined by flow cytometry and real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), respectively. Finally, Sirt1 activity was measured with a luminescence assay.
Results
The percentage of Sirt1-positive mononuclear cells from adipose tissue decreased along with Sirt1 enzymatic activity in overweight/obese participants. MiR-34a expression increased in the overweight/obese group compared to normoweight individuals. There was a negative association between the relative miR-34a expression and Sirt1-positive cells and a synergistic effect on Sirt1-positive cells mediated by the miR-34 inhibitor and Sirt1 agonist.
Conclusions
Our results describe for the first time the presence of miR-34a and Sirt1 in mononuclear cells isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissue. Additionally, these results suggest altered sirtuin function in overweight/obese patients and open the possibility for new therapies that involve these metabolic targets."

abstract = "Background and aim
Adipocytokine dysfunction is considered as causative factor of target organ damage in metabolic disease. The aim of the study was to investigate whether altered adipocytokine profile predicts left ventricular (LV) remodeling in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Methods
A total of 186 patients (125 hypertensive and 61 non-hypertensive individuals) with established T2DM and 20 healthy volunteers were enrolled in the study. LV remodeling was determined at baseline. Concentrations of adipocytokines were measured with ELISA at baseline.
Results
The most important predictors of LV hypertrophy in T2DM patients were serum levels of omentin-1 (B-coefficient = −0.64, p = 0.001), Zinc-α2-glycoprotein [ZA2G] (B-coefficient = −0.57, p = 0.002), visfatin (B-coefficient = 0.26, p = 0.034), hs-CRP (B-coefficient = 0.38, p = 0.002), HOMA-IR (B-coefficient = 0.34, p = 0.001), age (B-coefficient = 0.31, p = 0.022), glypican-4 (B-coefficient = −0.23, p = 0.042), and male sex (B-coefficient = 0.11, p = 0.048). After entering combined depending variable (LV hypertrophy and LV diastolic dysfunction) to the model the significant predictors remained serum levels of omentin-1 (B-coefficient = −0.82, p = 0.001), ZA2G (B-coefficient = −0.54, p = 0.001) and HOMA-IR (B-coefficient = 0.44, p = 0.001). Regression analyses showed that the most influential determinants of depending variable (LV hypertrophy + LV diastolic dysfunction) in T2DM patients were omentin-1 (B-coefficient = −1.6, p = 0.001) and ZA2G (B-coefficient = −0.78, p = 0.044).
Conclusion
We found that serum levels of omentin-1 and ZA2G were the most important predictors for LV hypertrophy + LV diastolic dysfunction in T2DM patients. Large clinical trials are required to confirm this assumption and get clear explanation of issues unveiled."

India has the second largest number of patients with diabetes, and research to contain it and limit its complications is needed.
Methods
A literature search was done using Pubmed and Google Scholar search engines to prepare a narrative review on this topic.
Results
India’s contribution to research on diabetes remains inadequate, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Most of the work thus far has been done by a limited number of organisations and individuals, and has been confined to certain limited areas of interest. Nearly 40% of the publications on diabetes in India between 2000 and 2009 originated from just 20 institutions. Many important aspects of diabetes in India remain uninvestigated. In this review we make an attempt to evaluate the current status of diabetes research in India and to understand the hurdles dissuading a large proportion of healthcare professionals in India from embarking on a career in research. We also suggest solutions for overcoming these hurdles.
Conclusions
Considering the major health and economic problems posed by the unrestrained diabetes epidemic in India, research in this area remains highly inadequate."

abstract = "The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak once again demonstrated the importance of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in patients with diabetes. Activation of the RAS increases in patients with diabetes. The virus attaches to the ACE2 enzyme at low cytosolic pH values and enters into the cell and causes infection. Especially in the presence of diabetes mellitus and accompanying comorbid conditions such as hypertension, obesity, old age, and smoking, cytosolic pH is low, thus the virus easily may enter the cell by attaching to ACE2. ACEIs and ARBs lead to a reduction in angiotensin II level by increasing the ACE2 level, thus they cause a low cytosolic pH. Increased cardiac ACE2 levels due to ACEIs and ARBs can trigger cardiac arrhythmias and myocarditis by causing the virus to easily enter the heart tissue. There is ACE2 activity in the rostral ventrolateral medulla in the brain stem. The release of angiotensin 1-7 in the brain stem leads to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. This activation causes systemic vasoconstriction and the patient’s blood pressure increases. The most important event is the increased sympathetic activity via the central stimulation, this activity increases pulmonary capillary leaking, causing the ARDS. As the cytosolic pH, which is already low in patients with diabetes will decrease further with the mechanisms mentioned above, the viral load will increase and the infection will be exacerbated. As a result, the use of ACEIs and ARBs in patients with diabetes can lead to increased morbidity and mortality of COVID-19."

abstract = "Background and aims
Type 2 diabetes confers a differential risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease according to the gender. Whether newly approved anti-diabetic drugs like sodium-glucose co-transport-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2Is) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) that have shown a significant reduction in the CV end-points in CV outcome trials (CVOTs) also have a differential impact gender-wise, is still not clearly known.
Methods
We systematically searched the medical database up to December 31, 2019 and retrieved all the dedicated CVOTs conducted with SGLT-2Is and GLP-1RAs that explicitly reported the outcome of major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Subsequently, we pooled the hazard ratio (HR) of MACE in both sexes separately and meta-analyzed the result gender-wise.
Results
The meta-analysis of three CVOTs conducted with SGLT-2Is (N = 34,322), demonstrated a significant reduction in MACE in men but not in women (Men - HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.83 to 0.97; P = 0.006; Women - HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.00; P = 0.06) compared to placebo. The meta-analysis of seven CVOTs conducted with GLP-1RAs (N = 56,004) demonstrated a significant reduction in MACE in both sex (Men - HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82 to 0.93; P < 0.0001; Women - HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.99; P = 0.03), against the placebo.
Conclusions
The reduction in MACE with SGLT-2Is appears to be significantly less in women with diabetes vs men, while GLP-1RAs confers a similar reduction in MACE, irrespective of the gender. Whether these results are related to inadequate statistical power (underrepresentation of women) in CVOT, or it reflects a true gender difference, still remains to be established."

and Aims: No valid treatment or preventative strategy has evolved till date to counter the SARS CoV 2 (Novel Coronavirus) epidemic that originated in China in late 2019 and have since wrought havoc on millions across the world with illness, socioeconomic recession and death. This analysis was aimed at tracing a trend related to death counts expected at the 5th and 6th week of the COVID-19 in India.
Material and methods
Validated database was used to procure global and Indian data related to coronavirus and related outcomes. Multiple regression and linear regression analyses were used interchangeably. Since the week 6 death count data was not correlated significantly with any of the chosen inputs, an auto-regression technique was employed to improve the predictive ability of the regression model.
Results
A linear regression analysis predicted average week 5 death count to be 211 with a 95% CI: 1.31–2.60). Similarly, week 6 death count, in spite of a strong correlation with input variables, did not pass the test of statistical significance. Using auto-regression technique and using week 5 death count as input the linear regression model predicted week 6 death count in India to be 467, while keeping at the back of our mind the risk of over-estimation by most of the risk-based models.
Conclusion
According to our analysis, if situation continue in present state; projected death rate (n) is 211 and467 at the end of the 5th and 6th week from now, respectively."

Older adults and people who have cardiovascular disorders (their common pathogenetic mechanism is progressive atherosclerosis) are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). Their common pathogenetic mechanism is progressive atherosclerosis in which oxLDL (oxidized LDL) plays major role. Receptor-mediated uptake of oxLDL by the monocyte-derived macrophages activates the long-term epigenetic reprogramming of innate immunity, which is termed “trained immunity.” The aim of this work is to investigate the mechanisms and treatment possibilities that can control the activities of these specific macrophages.
Methods
Search in Medline and PubMed relevant articles on the trained immunity and cytokine storm of COVID-19.
Results and Conclusions
When oxLDL-trained macrophages encounter SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) in the lung, it causes unregulated cytokine secretion, leading to the alveolar damage. Therefore, blocking macrophage training by pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, could control the hyperactivation that the virus would trigger."

Several studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) from the United States and European countries have demonstrated a higher risk of morbidity and mortality than those without T2DM following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The data from Indian patients are scarce. Therefore, this study was carried out to focus on immediate postoperative complications following CABG in Indian patients.
Methods
Eighteen hundred consecutive patients who underwent elective CABG were included. Following exclusion criteria, a total of 1017 subjects were included for final analysis. 692 (68%) patients had T2DM and 325 (32%) patients had no T2DM. Data were obtained by collecting clinical data, routine biochemistry and chest imaging. Patients were followed up to 7 days postoperatively.
Results
At baseline, hypertension, triple vessel coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease and peripheral vascular disease were more common in patients with T2DM. Intraoperatively, use of blood products and intra-aortic balloon pump were more common in T2DM patients. Postoperatively, 13.2% patients with T2DM developed acute kidney injury versus 5.3% in non-T2DM group. Requirement of dialysis was not different between groups (P = 0.394). Pneumonia occurred in 2 patients in both groups (P = 0.370). Catheter-associated urinary tract infections were similar in two groups (P = 0.507). Mortality occurred only in one T2DM patient and none in non-T2DM group (P = 0.618).
Conclusions
A significant number of patients with T2DM developed acute kidney injury following CABG. There was no difference in infective complications such as pneumonia and catheter-associated urinary tract infection, between the two groups."

Eligibility criteria were cross-sectional, cohort or case-control observational studies that assessed the association between reduced magnesium levels and poor glycemic control and/or complications in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.
Results
Nine articles were included in the systematic review and two in the meta-analysis, all articles being cross-sectional. Among the seven studies that were designed to evaluate glycemic control, five showed an association between reduced levels of magnesium and poor glycemic control, and these findings were corroborated by the meta-analysis. Among the two studies in which dyslipidemia was evaluated, both showed higher levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, and lower levels of HDL cholesterol in patients with lower levels of magnesium as compared to those with higher magnesium levels. The three studies that evaluated diabetes kidney disease and the two studies that evaluated diabetic retinopathy found divergent results.

Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been widely evaluated as a biomarker in various medical and surgical prognoses, but its usefulness in diabetic kidney disease is not yet known.
Methods
This prospective observational study included outpatients, comprised of 184 men aged 73 ± 11 (mean ± standard deviation) years and 174 women aged 76 ± 10 years at baseline, from a rural hospital. We examined the relationship between baseline NLR calculated by analyzing the differential leukocyte counts in the complete blood count and the 2-year estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline rate (i.e. 2-year eGFR−baseline eGFR) ∗100/baseline eGFR. Rapid eGFR decline rate was defined as a value < -25%.
Results
Multiple linear regression analysis using rapid eGFR decline rates as objective variables, adjusted for confounding factors as explanatory variables, showed that NLR (β = 0.138, p = 0.007) as well as presence of antidyslipidemic medication, hemoglobinA1c, and urinary albumin excretion stage were significantly and independently associated with a rapid eGFR decline rate. The multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of the 2nd and 3rd tertiles of baseline NLR for rapid eGFR decline rate were 3.62 (0.70–18.7) and 8.03 (1.54–41.9), respectively. Multivariate-adjusted mean eGFR (95% confidence interval) values after 2 years categorized by tertile of baseline NLR were: 1st, 63.9 (61.8–66.1); 2nd, 60.8 (58.7–62.9); and 3rd, 58.9 (56.8–61.0).

As on date, no specific treatment is available for devastating COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. This pandemic viral infection has affected over 200 countries within a very short time and created a calamitous situation across the globe. As per WHO guidelines, the treatment is mainly symptomatic and supportive. This clinical protocol has not proven sufficient to save the lives of COVID-19 patients suffering from diabetes or having underlying liver diseases; hence there is utmost need to tackle this situation by other means such as Convalescent Plasma (CP) therapy.
Methods
A comprehensive literature survey was carriedout using Elsevier, PubMed, Taylor & Francis, Springer, Nature and Google search engines.
Results
The patients suffering from diabetes or liver dysfunction or any other underlying diseases are at greatest risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. From the study, it is proved that plasma collected from the recovered patients of viral infection has considerable potential to treat the viral disease without the occurrence of adverse effects.
Conclusion
The CP therapy can be a possible life saving alternative to treat critical COVID-19 patients having diabetes or underlying liver dysfunction. Hence, randomised clinical trials are recommended at the earliest to save the lives of infected individuals of COVID-19."

To compare the strength of associations between surrogate indexes of insulin resistance (sIR) and risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in non-Hispanic White (NHW), non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and Mexican American (MA) adults.
Methods
The 2013–2016 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data (n = 3435) were used for this study. The associations between sIR that includes Triglyceride/HDL cholesterol ratio (TG/HDL-C), triglyceride glucose (TG) index, visceral adiposity index (VAI), lipid accumulation product (LAP), TG-body mass index (TG-BMI), and TG-waist circumference (TG-WC) and risk for MetS were determined using the prevalence odds ratio (OR) from the logistic regression analyses. Pseudo-R-squared tests were used to estimate the proportion of variance in MetS accounted for by each sIR. Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian Information Criterion from the multinomial logistic regression analysis were used to compare models that included each sIR and its components separately as predictors of MetS. Areas under curves (AUC) from the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) were used to detect their diagnostic capabilities.
Results
Compared with other sIR, TG-WC (AUC = 0.899; 95% CI: 0.884–0.913 in NHW) and (AUC = 0.893; 95% CI:0.871–0.915 in NHB), and LAP (AUC = 877; 95% CI: 0.861–0.894 in MA) exhibited the highest diagnostic and predictive accuracy for MetS. Compared with other sIR, TG-WC (OR = 22.8; 95% CI:16.6–31.0 in NHW) and (OR = 22.7; 95% CI:13.1–39.3 in NHB), and LAP (OR = 10.6; 95%:6.6–17.0 in MA) were most significantly associated with increased odds of MetS, adjusting for eGFR, age, marital status, CHD, CHF, income, education, physical activity, alcohol use, smoking and use of cholesterol-lowering medication.
Conclusions
TG-WC in NHW and NHB, and LAP in MA are more powerful than other proxies of IR in predicting MetS. TG-WC and LAP can serve as adjunctive tools for screening for MetS in NHW, NHB, and MA."

We aimed to establish whether blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration was associated with COVID-19 risk, and whether it explained the higher incidence of COVID-19 in black and South Asian people.
Methods
UK Biobank recruited 502,624 participants aged 37–73 years between 2006 and 2010. Baseline exposure data, including 25(OH)D concentration and ethnicity, were linked to COVID-19 test results. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed for the association between 25(OH)D and confirmed COVID-19, and the association between ethnicity and both 25(OH)D and COVID-19.
Results
Complete data were available for 348,598 UK Biobank participants. Of these, 449 had confirmed COVID-19 infection. Vitamin D was associated with COVID-19 infection univariably (OR = 0.99; 95% CI 0.99–0.999; p = 0.013), but not after adjustment for confounders (OR = 1.00; 95% CI = 0.998–1.01; p = 0.208). Ethnicity was associated with COVID-19 infection univariably (blacks versus whites OR = 5.32, 95% CI = 3.68–7.70, p-value<0.001; South Asians versus whites OR = 2.65, 95% CI = 1.65–4.25, p-value<0.001). Adjustment for 25(OH)D concentration made little difference to the magnitude of the association.
Conclusions
Our findings do not support a potential link between vitamin D concentrations and risk of COVID-19 infection, nor that vitamin D concentration may explain ethnic differences in COVID-19 infection."

abstract = "Background and aims
The outbreak of the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, causes a respiratory disease and individuals with pre-existing cardiometabolic disorders display worse prognosis through the infection course. The aim of this minireview is to present epidemiological data related to metabolic comorbidities in association with the SARS-CoV-2.
Methods
This is a narrative mini-review with Pubmed search until April 23, 2020 using the keywords COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, treatment of coronavirus and following terms: diabetes mellitus, obesity, arterial hypertension, ACE-inhibitors, cytokine storm, immune response and vitamin D.
Results
Studies indicate that obese individuals are more likely to develop infections, and that adipose tissue serves as a pathogen reservoir. In diabetic individuals higher rate of inflammatory processes is seen due to constant glucose recognition by C type lectin receptors. Hypertensive individuals, usually grouped with other conditions, are treated with drugs to reduce blood pressure mostly through ACEi and ARB, that leads to increased ACE2 expression, used by SARS-CoV-2 for human’s cell entry. Until now, the studies have shown that individuals with those conditions and affected by COVID-19 present an uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an unbalanced immune response, leading to the cytokine storm phenomenon. Vitamin D is highlighted as a potential therapeutic target, because in addition to acting on the immune system, it plays an important role in the control of cardiometabolic diseases.
Conclusion
Currently, since there is no proven and effective antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2, the efforts should focus on controlling inflammatory response and reduce the risks of associated complications."

Background and aims
COVID-19 is an emerging pandemic due to droplet infection of 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Due to its rapid transmission and high case-fatality rate, recognition of its risk and prognostic factor is important. Obesity has been associated with impaired immune system, increasing the susceptibility for 2019-nCoV infection. We aimed to study the impact of obesity to the prognosis and disease severity of COVID-19.
Methods
A systematic search and handsearching was conducted in four databases: Cochrane, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed. The identified articles were screened using the chosen eligibility criteria. We obtained three retrospective cohort studies (Wu J et al., Lighter J et al., and Simonnet A et al.) to be critically appraised using Newcastle Ottawa Scale.
Results
The findings of all included studies were consistent in stating the contribution of obesity as a risk factor to increase the requirement for advanced medical care. Study with the highest quality, Simonnet A et al., reported an increase need of invasive mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients with body mass index higher than 35 kg/m2, OR: 7.36 (1.63–33.14; p = 0.021). This is associated with a higher mortality rate in obese population infected with COVID-19.
Conclusion
Obesity is an independent risk and prognostic factor for the disease severity and the requirement of advanced medical care in COVID-19. This systematic review highlights a particularly vulnerable group – obese, and emphasises on the importance of treatment aggression and disease prevention in this population group."

Previous studies have indicated controversial results regarding the efficacy of green tea extract (GTE) in improving the lipid profile of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to pool data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
Methods
A systematic search was performed in Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus databases, without any language and time restriction until August 2019, to retrieve the RCTs which examined the effects of GTE on serum concentrations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglyceride (TG) or total cholesterol (TC) in T2DM patients. Meta-analyses were carried out using a random effects model. I2 index was used to evaluate the heterogeneity.
Results
Initial search yielded 780 publications. Of these, seven studies were eligible. The supplementary intake of GTE improved lipid profile by reducing serum TG concentrations in patients with T2DM. Meanwhile, subgroup analyses based on duration of interventions (≤8 and > 8 weeks) and intervention dosage (≤800 and > 800 mg/day) showed that the GTE supplementation longer than 8 weeks and in doses >800 mg/day resulted in a significant decrease in serum TG concentrations. Furthermore, intervention longer than 8 weeks with doses lower than 800 mg/day resulted in a significant reduction in serum TC concentrations.
Conclusion
In conclusion, present systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that the supplementary intake of GTE may improve lipid profile by reducing serum concentrations of TG in patients with T2DM. Furthermore, the results of our stratified analyses suggested that long-term GTE intervention may reduce serum concentrations of TG and TC."

To evaluate the association between elevated serum transaminase levels and insulin resistance (IR) in a population of healthy individuals.
Methods
We define IR with a cut-off point of homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) ≥ 3.8. For aspartate aminotransferase (AST), we consider elevated values >30 U/L in women and values >36 U/L in men. For alanine aminotransferase (ALT), we consider elevated values >30 U/L in women and values >40 U/L in men. We performed a crude and adjusted generalized linear model from Poisson family with robust variance, in order to evaluate the association between elevated serum transaminase levels and IR. The associations were presented as prevalence ratio (PR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
Results
We included 261 participants in the study. The median age was 39 years (31–45) and 23.7% of the participants were men. The prevalence of elevated serum transaminase for AST and ALT were, 13.8% and 26.1%, respectively. The prevalence of IR was 34.1%. In the crude analysis we found statistical significance between elevated AST and ALT with IR (PR = 3.18; 95% CI: 2.33–4.34 and PR = 2.44; 95% CI: 1.88–3.30; respectively).

We performed a retrospective study of diabetic patients undergoing a targeted multimodal prehabilitation programme to assess changes in their diabetic control and functional capacity prior to surgery. As part of the programme, patients were encouraged to follow a low-carbohydrate, high-fat (LCHF) dietary approach. We aimed to assess the feasibility and effects of this programme on our cohort of patients.
Methods
From 79 patients attending prehabilitation, 17 (13 males, age (median [interquartile range]): 71 [63–79] years) had Type 2 diabetes and none had Type 1. Patients had undergone a targeted multimodal prehabilitation programme prior to surgery, which comprised supervised exercise sessions (aerobic or resistance training), nutritional education (LCHF suggestion, correct protein intake, and avoidance of processed food), psychological support and medical optimization. Weight, body mass index (BMI), glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting glucose, and functional capacity were measured prior to and after prehabilitation. Data were compared with a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
Results
There were significant improvements in HbA1c (P = 0.000), fasting glucose (P = 0.006), weight (P = 0.002), and BMI (P = 0.002). There were no significant improvements in functional capacity.
Conclusions
We have shown that in the preoperative period, a targeted multimodal prehabilitation programme incorporating a LCHF diet improves diabetes control in patients with T2D awaiting elective surgery. Our approach is novel as a LCHF diet has not previously been utilized in patients with diabetes within this context. Prospective studies are required in the context of post-operative outcomes."

20 articles were selected and studied based on eight theories which they used. These theories were: Social support theory, Health Belief Model, Heath Belief Model and Empowerment Theory, Empowerment Theory, Self-efficacy Theory, precede-proceed model, Self-regulation Theory, behavioral theory and Social Cognitive Theory.
Conclusion
Four theories appeared to be more effective for the target behavior of present research: Social Support Theory and the combination of Empowerment Theory and Health Belief Model, Social Cognitive Theory and Self Efficacy Theory. Taken together, the findings of this systematic review suggest that interventions that go beyond individual determinants (such as changing knowledge and attitudes) to determinants of upper cognitive, motor, and social levels (such as the development of skills and competencies) they have led to raised self-care outcomes."

Hypertension and diabetes are global health problems with an incidence that is rapidly increasing worldwide. Depression is the most frequent mental health co-morbidity and is considered an important risk factor for the development of both diseases. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with depression among Peruvian adults with hypertension and diabetes.
Methods
We performed a secondary analysis of the 2017 Peru Demographic and Family Health Survey, using data from 10,566 adults aged 40 and older. The main outcome was depression assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Other important variables were the diagnosis of hypertension or diabetes, sex, age, level of education, geographical region, wealth index, daily smoking, harmful alcohol consumption and physical disability.
Results
The overall prevalence of depression was 23.15% (CI 95%: 21.42%–24.88%) and among adults with hypertension and diabetes it was 34.96% (CI 95%: 29.33%–40.59%) and 35.56% (CI 95%: 24.49%–46.63%), respectively. Whereas the prevalence of depression among adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was higher in the physical disability group (PRa: 1.28; CI 95%: 1.12–1.45), the prevalence of depression among adults with hypertension was higher in the female group (PRa: 1.36; CI 95%: 1.20–1.54) and among those with harmful alcohol consumption (PRa: 1.50; CI 95%: 1.01–2.24).
Conclusion
Peru has a considerable burden of depression in the hypertensive and diabetic populations. While the variables positively associated with depression in hypertensive adults were female gender and harmful alcohol consumption, in adults with diabetes it was the presence of physical disability."

According to the World Obesity Federation, “obesity-related conditions seem to worsen the effect of Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2)”; additionally the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention reported that “people with heart disease and diabetes are at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 complications and that severe obesity poses a higher risk for severe illness”. Recent reports have shown elevated levels of cytokines due to increased inflammation in patients with SARS-CoV-2 disease. On the other hand, obesity represents a state of low-grade inflammation, with various inflammatory products directly excreted by adipose tissue. In this concise report we aimed to assess common elements of obesity and SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Methods
Pubmed search on obesity and SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Results
We present “mechanistic” obesity-related problems that aggravate SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as tentative inflammatory/metabolic links between these diseases.
Conclusion

Periodontal Disease (PD) is associated with complications of diabetes. Control of the PD reduces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship of PD with duration, severity of diabetes and eGFR.
Material and method
A Prospective observational study conducted at Sidhi Vinayaka Hospitals (SVH) Sangareddy during the period of January 2014 to December 2019. Total 1436 patients with a definite diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), between the ages of 45–60 years were included. They were classified according to CPITN score for PD and compared against the variables.
Results
A total of 1436 consecutive outpatients attending to SVH were included. Among them 662 (46.1%) were males and 774(53.9%) were females. The mean age of the patients was 48.3(SD ± 10.62) and mean duration of diabetes was 2.9(SD ± 4.18). The mean fasting blood glucose was 198.5(SD ± 85), mean post prandial blood glucose was 277.2 (SD ± 107.7) and mean HBA1c was 9.98% (SD ± 2.6). Among the study group 1198 (83.4%) had none/mild (Grade I) PD, 192(13.4%) had moderate/severe (Grade II) PD and 46(3.2%) were completely edentulous (Grade III).
Conclusion
There is a linear correlation between PD and age of patient, duration of diabetes, eGFR and level of glycemic status among rural population with T2DM."

COVID-19 is a public world crisis, however, it is a self-limited infection. In COVID-19, the strength of immune and respiratory systems is a critical element. Thus, this review was conducted to demonstrate the short and long term effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on increasing the function and strength of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections and associated disorders.
Methods
This review was carried out by searching in Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, Medline databases. The search was conducted over clinical trials and literature and systematic reviews on the effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on the function and strength of specific immune and respiratory elements essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections.
Results
This review found that increasing the aerobic capacity could produce short-term safe improvements in the function of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those specific for COVID-19 infections. This could be mainly produced through three mechanisms. Firstly, it could improve immunity by increasing the level and function of immune cells and immunoglobulins, regulating CRP levels, and decreasing anxiety and depression. Secondly, it could improve respiratory system functions by acting as an antibiotic, antioxidant, and antimycotic, restoring normal lung tissue elasticity and strength. Lastly, it could act as a protective barrier to decrease COVID-19 risk factors, which helps to decrease the incidence and progression of COVID-19.
Conclusion
This review summarizes that increasing the aerobic capacity is recommended because it has potential of improving immune and respiratory functions which would help counter COVID-19."

abstract = "Background and Aims
There is inconsistent evidence supporting the self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in people with non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes (T2D). Structured SMBG protocols have a greater impact on glycaemic control than unstructured SMBG and may improve measures of glycaemic variability (GV), though few previous studies have reported on specific GV outcomes. Our aim was to determine the impact of structured SMBG on simple measures of GV in people with T2D.
Methods
Participants undertook structured SMBG over 12 months, with HbA1c recorded at baseline and at 3-monthly follow-up. For each participant, the mean blood glucose (MBG), fasting blood glucose (FBG), standard deviation BG (SD-BG), coefficient of variation of BG (CV-BG), mean absolute glucose change (MAG) and HbA1c were determined for each 3-month period. Responders were participants with an improvement in HbA1c of ≥5 mmol/mol (0.5%) over 12 months.
Results
Data from two hundred and thirty-one participants were included for analysis. Participants had a baseline median [interquartile range] HbA1c 68.0 [61.5–75.5] mmol/mol (8.4%). Participants demonstrated significant improvements in the MBG (−1.25 mmol/L), FBG (−0.97 mmol/L), SD-BG (−0.44 mmol/L), CV-BG (−1.43%), MAG (−0.97 mmol/L), and HbA1c (−7.0 mmol/mol) (all p < 0.001) at 12 months compared to these measures collected within the first 3 months of SMBG. Responders had a significantly higher baseline median [interquartile range] HbA1c of 70.0 [63.0–78.0] mmol/mol compared to 61.0 [56.5–66.0] mmol/mol in non-responders (P < 0.001).
Conclusions
Structured SMBG improved all the observed measures of GV. These results support the use of structured SMBG in people with non-insulin treated T2D."

Prior studies have shown that Helicobacter pylori (H. Pylori) has the important role in the development of gastrointestinal diseases and diabetes in patients with diabetes. Due to the contradictory results on the prevalence of H. pylori in patients, we carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to discover the pooled prevalence of H. Pylori in patients with diabetes.
Methods
A systematic literature search was performed utilizing international databases including Medline (PubMed), Web of sciences, Scopus, EMBASE, Cochrane, Ovid and CINHAL to retrieve all cross-sectional studies which had reported H. pylori prevalence in patients with diabetes between January 1990 and March 2019. The random effects models were applied to calculate the pooled prevalence with 95% confidence interval.
Results
A total of 13 articles were selected for meta-analysis according to PRISMA guideline. The pooled prevalence of H. Pylori was obtained 54% (95% CI: 44%–64%) in patients with diabetes. The highest and least prevalence of H. pylori were associated to Africa (66%; 95%CI: 49%–73%) and USA (15%; 95%CI: 8%−26%). In addition, the rapid urease test and biopsy/histology had the most strength in detecting of the H. pylori infection. The meta-regression analysis demonstrated that H. pylori prevalence is not affected by patients’ age, publication year, study duration, and HbA1C.
Conclusion
Given that the high prevalence of H. pylori in patients with diabetes and its important role in the development of gastrointestinal diseases and diabetes, treatment and eradication of this bacterium should be considered in patients with diabetes."

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the association of gravidity and age at first pregnancy with metabolic syndrome in a large-scale, population-based cohort study in Iran.
Methods
The present secondary analysis was conducted on a subset of the population (5739 women with at least one pregnancy) enrolled in the Tabari cohort study. Reproductive history was collected using a structured questionnaire. The relationship of gravidity and age at first pregnancy with metabolic syndrome and its components was analyzed using the logistic regression model.
Results
The results showed that after adjustment for confounding variables, the odds of having metabolic syndrome was not significantly associated with age at first pregnancy (P = 0.269) and gravidity (P = 0.504). However, there was an association between hypertension and age at first pregnancy (OR = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.12–0.82; P = 0.03). Additionally, waist circumference was also associated with gravidity (OR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.37–3.35).
Conclusion
As the findings indicated, age at first pregnancy and gravidity were not associated with the odds of having metabolic syndrome. However, a relationship was found between first pregnancy at the age of >35 years and the decreased risk of hypertension. Gravidity was also found to be a dose-dependent risk factor for increased waist circumference."

Given, that the modern world human population is constantly exposed to multiple stressors in the form of physical (i.e., sound, weather etc.) and chemical environment (i.e., diet, pollutants etc.), industrialization, and modernization has led to form a basis for exposomal correlation with T2DM incidence. Over the past decade, there have been emerging reports on association of levels of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), phthalates, antibiotics, drugs, air pollution, pesticides, and heavy metals with T2DM. In this review, we discuss the well known chemical exposome that has been associated with T2DM; the tools and approaches to capture this chemical exposome, and future opportunities and challenges in this exciting area of research. We further provide a window of thoughts, whether omics technologies can help fill in the gaps to help provide high throughput exposomics datasets in an unbiased manner to help understand T2DM pathophysiology in the context of industrialization, drastic lifestyle changes, urbanization, and pollution.

The present study aimed to evaluate the in vitro inhibitory effect of S. officinalis on key digestive enzymes linked to type 2 diabetes and to identify its hemolytic effect.
Methods
Hydro-methanol decoction extract and fractions of ethyl acetate and n-butanol were investigated for their in vitro α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities, compared to acarbose as a standard. Furthermore, they were evaluated for their hemolytic effect.
Results
Phytochemical composition demonstrated the richness of S. officinalis in secondary metabolites. Extract and fractions inhibited the activity of both enzymes. They showed weak hemolytic activity. Quantitative estimation of total phenolic and flavonoids revealed that ethyl acetate fraction contained the highest amount of these compounds (450.51 ± 0.6 μg GAE/mg DE and 352.01 ± 0.78 μg CE/mg of DE, respectively). It showed the best antidiabetic activity tested both by α-amylase and α-glucosidase assays (IC50 = 46.52 ± 2.68 and 104.58 ± 0.06 μg/mL, respectively). Moreover, this fraction showed the least hemolytic effect (11.58 ± 0.1%).

Multivariate analysis revealed <55 years of age, female gender, >3 years duration of diabetes, HbA1c >10% at the first visit, presence of dyslipidemia, and insulin treatment as significant determinants of an increased risk of poor glycemic control. BMI <25 kg/m2 and presence of hypertension were associated with a decreased risk of poor glycemic control.
Conclusion
Using data from the largest cohort of T2DM patients from Iraq to date, this tertiary care database analysis over a 9-year period indicated poor glycemic control. Younger patient age, female gender, longer disease duration, initially high HbA1c levels, dyslipidemia, insulin treatment, overweight and obesity, and lack of hypertension were associated with an increased risk of poor glycemic control in Iraqi T2DM patients."

Retarding the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection by preventive strategies is the first line of management. Several countries have declared a stringent lockdown in order to enforce social distancing and prevent the spread of infection. This analysis was conducted in an attempt to understand the impact of lockdown on infection and death rates over a period of time in countries with declared lock-down.
Material and methods
A validated database was used to generate data related to countries with declared lockdown. Simple regression analysis was conducted to assess the rate of change in infection and death rates. Subsequently, a k-means and hierarchical cluster analysis was done to identify the countries that performed similarly. Sweden and South Korea were included as counties without lockdown in a second-phase cluster analysis.
Results
There was a significant 61% and 43% reduction in infection rates 1-week post lockdown in the overall and India cohorts, respectively, supporting its effectiveness. Countries with higher baseline infections and deaths (Spain, Germany, Italy, UK, and France-cluster 1) fared poorly compared to those who declared lockdown early on (Belgium, Austria, New Zealand, India, Hungary, Poland and Malaysia-cluster 2). Sweden and South Korea, countries without lock-down, fared as good as the countries in cluster 2.
Conclusion
Lockdown has proven to be an effective strategy is slowing down the SARS-CoV-2 disease progression (infection rate and death) exponentially. The success story of non-lock-down countries (Sweden and South Korea) need to be explored in detail, to identify the variables responsible for the positive results."

abstract = "Background and aims
The primary approach for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) involves lifestyle modification and diet therapy along with pharmacologic interventions. Many patients are interested to identify nutritional supplements that may provide benefit in prevention and management of diabetes. However, the efficacy and safety of nutritional supplements such as chromium, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), vitamin D, zinc and magnesium in disease treatment is a worrying and controversial matter. In this narrative review, patients and health care providers are introduced to the effects of mentioned dietary supplements that may help in choosing or not choosing these supplements in treatment of diabetes.
Methods
This review was carried out using comprehensive and systematic literature reports on the dietary supplements in the management of diabetes. Empirical searches were conducted using Google Scholar, Science Direct and PubMed databases. Searches were also undertaken using keywords, in English, such as “chromium” OR “vitamin D” OR “omega-3 fatty acids” OR “zinc” OR “magnesium” in combination with “type 2 diabetes”.
Results
The available evidence is insufficient to create a definite conclusion that nutritional supplements including chromium, n-3 PUFAs, vitamin D, zinc and magnesium might be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of T2DM and therefore, the general recommendation to use these supplements in the management of diabetes cannot be justified. The results of most studies lack uniformity across multiple aspects, including different dose and formation of supplements, duration, and subjects under intervention.
Conclusions
There is a need for well-designed, high quality, large and long-term studies to strengthen the available evidence and ensure the safety and efficacy of products."

Specific amino acids have been linked to regulation of insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells; on the contrary, increased concentration of certain amino acids is associated with insulin resistance (IR) and development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Nowadays, urine as a biological sample has attracted more attention for diagnosis of disease for its special superiority; insufficient research in the study of urinary amino acid (UAA) pattern in patients with T2DM has led to the present study with the aim to determine the levels of UAAs, their excretory patterns and the association of UAA to plasma glucose and IR in patients with T2DM.
Methods
Quantification of total urinary amino acids was done spectrophotometrically and the patterns of amino acid excretion was elucidated by thin layer chromatography technique. Fasting blood samples were used for plasma glucose and insulin estimation by fully automated analyzer.
Result
The levels of UAA in patients with T2DM in comparison to healthy controls were higher (p < 0.0001). The frequency of urinary phenylalanine, arginine, tryptophan, tyrosine and cysteine were significantly higher in patients with T2DM than controls. There was also a strong positive correlation of UAA levels with blood glucose levels and HOMA–IR in patients with T2DM.
Conclusion
Our study has shown subtle abnormalities in UAA patterns in patients with T2DM. The measurement of UAA levels and excretory pattern can be used as an index of hyperglycemia and IR which could serve as an inexpensive and non-invasive marker for T2DM. More studies are required to confirm this association."

Diabetes mellitus is associated with a more severe course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor for host cell entry. We aimed to assess the interactions between antihyperglycemic drugs and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and their putative roles in COVID-19.
Methods
A literature search was performed using Pubmed to review the interrelationships between hyperglycemia, RAS and COVID-19, and the effects of antihyperglycemic medications.
Results
The RAS has an essential role in glucose homeostasis and may have a role in COVID-19-induced lung injury. Some antihyperglycemic medications modulate RAS and might hypothetically alleviate the deleterious effect of angiotensin II on lung injury. Furthermore, most antihyperglycemic medications showed anti-inflammatory effects in animal models of lung injury.
Conclusions
Some antihyperglycemic medications might have protective effects against COVID-19-induced lung injury. Early insulin therapy seems very promising in alleviating lung injury."

The varying views as to the usefulness of serum cystatin C (CysC) as an early marker of diabetic nephropathy (DN) prompted us to investigate existing literature to determine whether serum CysC can be used as an early marker of DN using a meta-analysis approach.
Materials and methods
Twelve studies written in English were retrieved from PubMed using various key search terms. Data were extracted from the included studies by two of the authors and was subjected to statistical analysis using Review Manager 5.3 and Meta-Essentials. Levels of serum CysC were compared between the study groups using the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI).
Results
Overall outcomes indicate that serum CysC levels are higher among those with microalbuminuria (MI) and macroalbuminuria (MA) than those in the control group (CN) and those with normoalbuminuria (NO). However, these findings were heterogeneous, which warranted an investigation using the Galbraith plot. Heterogeneity was either reduced or lost in the post-outlier outcomes indicating combinability of the studies.
Conclusion
Serum CysC is shown to be a superior biomarker in the early diagnosis of DN. However, further studies are still needed to verify our claims."

Objective: The present study aims to find out the underlying physiological domains for the phenotypic attribution of metabolic syndrome as documented in several studies. Methodology: Literature search was done using Google Scholar, PUBMED, Research Gate and manual searching to identify relevant studies of the selected topic. Conclusion: More than one physiological domain has been explored for the expression of metabolic syndrome explored in different studies. A reason for this disparity may be because most of explored factors are just mathematically significant but not biologically. Another reason may be the varied factor load concern. Therefore, a fixed factor load value is needed to be restricted for all studies across world."

Worldwide, lifestyle is a significant risk factor for diabetes. Lifestyle changes can lead to differences in the extent of risk of diabetes among women and men. Kerala, a state with one of the best health indicators in India, has a high prevalence of diabetes. This study aimed at comparing the variations in the risk factors for HBG and VHBG among adult women and men in Kerala.
Methods
Data from the fourth round of the National Family Health Survey (2015–16) used to examine the differences in the risk factors for HBG and VHBG in men and women aged 15–49 years. We used bivariate, multivariate and Population Attributable Risk (PAR) techniques for analysing the data.
Results
Bivariate results have shown the pattern of HBG and VHBG prevalence in women and men was same among all the age groups; however, men show a higher HBG and VHBG than women in all the age groups. Prevalence of HBG and VHBG was higher in women with a primary education, who were poor and not working as compared to their male counterparts. PARs results show that the prevalence of VHBG was higher among obese men and women as compared to normal men and underweight women. Prevalence of HBG was higher among men as compared to women due to alcohol use and weekly consumption of non-vegetarian food.
Conclusions
The study suggests that there is an urgent need for targeted intervention programs to address the problem of HBG and VHBG in both men and women in Kerala to control blood glucose levels."

Balanced nutrition which can help in maintaining immunity is essential for prevention and management of viral infections. While data regarding nutrition in coronavirus infection (COVID-19) are not available, in this review, we aimed to evaluate evidence from previous clinical trials that studied nutrition-based interventions for viral diseases (with special emphasis on respiratory infections), and summarise our observations.
Methods
A systematic search strategy was employed using keywords to search the literature in 3 key medical databases: PubMed®, Web of Science® and SciVerse Scopus®. Studies were considered eligible if they were controlled trials in humans, measuring immunological parameters, on viral and respiratory infections. Clinical trials on vitamins, minerals, nutraceuticals and probiotics were included.
Results
A total of 640 records were identified initially and 22 studies were included from other sources. After excluding duplicates and articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria, 43 studies were obtained (vitamins: 13; minerals: 8; nutraceuticals: 18 and probiotics: 4). Among vitamins, A and D showed a potential benefit, especially in deficient populations. Among trace elements, selenium and zinc have also shown favourable immune-modulatory effects in viral respiratory infections. Several nutraceuticals and probiotics may also have some role in enhancing immune functions. Micronutrients may be beneficial in nutritionally depleted elderly population.

Methods
An exploratory study involving 28 patients with nascent MetS and 20 matched controls. Metabolites were studied from early morning urine samples and assayed by the NIH Western Metabolomics Center using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry and were standardized to urine creatinine. All of the patients enrolled in the study had normal renal and hepatic function.
Results
Patients with MetS had statistically significant increases in overall waist circumference, blood pressure, glucose, HOMA-IR, HbA1C in comparison to the control group. Additionally, increases in IL-1b, IL-6, TLR-4, endotoxin, and leptin were also seen in the MetS group subjects compared to the control group. The concentrations of homoserine were significantly decreased 3-fold in patients with MetS in comparison to the matched controls, p = 0.0027. Furthermore, levels of homoserine were inversely correlated to multiple biomarkers of inflammation and cardio-metabolic risk factors such as HbA1C, blood pressure, TLR-4, leptin, endotoxin, and SAT secreted fetuin A. In addition, homoserine was positively correlated with lysine and NAT.

Low glycemic index diets seem to be potentially effective to improve glycemic control and reduce lipid profiles. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of a low glycemic index/high fat, high-calorie diet on glycemic status and lipid profiles of patients with cystic fibrosis.
Methods
In this randomized clinical trial, 44 children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis were randomized to receive for three months either a high fat, high-calorie diet (n = 22) or a low glycemic index/high fat, high-calorie diet (n = 22) with similar calorie and macronutrients composition. Patients in high fat, high-calorie diet arm were allowed to use all sources of carbohydrates with different glycaemic indices; whereas those in another arm consumed carbohydrates from low glycemic index sources. Serum levels of lipid profiles (triglyceride, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol), insulin, fasting blood glucose, and glycated hemoglobin were measured at baseline and after the intervention.
Results
Between-group differences were significant only for fasting blood glucose (P < 0.001). However, fasting blood glucose (P = 0.003) and glycated hemoglobin (P = 0.002) significantly decreased after the intervention in the low glycemic index group, while in another group a significant increase in fasting blood glucose (P = 0.038) and triglyceride (P = 0.004) was found. No significant within-group differences were observed in other variables in both groups.
Conclusions
It seems that adherence to a low glycemic index/high fat, high-calorie diet can improve glycemic indices in children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis compared to the high fat, high-calorie diet.

Systematic searching of MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and ProQuest databases between 2009 and 2019 using keywords ‘Gestational Diabetes Mellitus’,’Screening’, ‘C-reactive protein’,’ High sensitivity CRP’was performed. The quality of articles was also assessed using the STROBE checklist.
Results
After a thorough search of the mentioned databases, 31 articles with the desired quality were finally selected. Most of studies showed significant relationship between CRP or high-sensitivity CRP(hs-CRP) level with GDMbutthe relationship was not significant in fewstudies.
Conclusions
Blood levels of CRP or hs-CRP could be used as a potential indicator for GDM, but more studies are needed."

abstract = "Aims
Binge eating disorder (BED) is the most common eating disorder in the United States and Europe and is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Presence and severity of BED have been associated with worse metabolic control and greater BMI in T2D patients. Glucagon Like Peptide-1 (GLP1) receptors are present in central nervous system areas involved in appetite regulation and treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists modulates appetite and reward-related brain areas in humans. We evaluated the effects of treatment with dulaglutide on eating behavior in T2D outpatients with BED.
Methods
This was a pilot open label, prospective controlled study. Inclusion criteria were: Age ≤65, HbA1c between 7.5 and 9% on metformin therapy alone, normal renal function and diagnosis of BED. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either Dulaglutide 1,5 mg/sett or Gliclazide 60 mg for 12 weeks. We evaluated baseline binge eating scale score (BES), weight, BMI, percentage fat mass, HbA1c and their changes after treatment. A multivariate linear regression model was used to verify the association between Δ BES from baseline with Δ Hba1c and variation of anthropometric parameters after treatment.
Results
After 12 weeks patients treated with dulaglutide had grater reduction of binge eating behaviour (p < 0.0001), body weight (p < 0,0001), BMI (p < 0.0001), percentage fat mass (p < 0.0001) and HbA1c (p = 0.009) than patients treated with gliclazide. Reduction in BES was associated with reduction in body weight (p < 0.0001) and HbA1c (p = 0.033).
Conclusion
Dulaglutide treatment reduces binge eating behaviour in T2D patients with BED."

We asked patients to fill in, at T0 and T2, two questionnaires based on the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire; and on the Hypoglycaemia Fear Survey. Glycaemic control improved, from 8.1 ± 1.3% at T0 to 7.8 ± 1.2% at T1 (p < 0.001) and remained unchanged after. Average number of controls increased from 3.2 ± 1.2 BGM to 7.7 ± 3.9 at T1 (p < 0.001). We observed a modest decrease in daily insulin doses. We evidenced an increase in mild hypoglycaemic events, especially in well-controlled subjects, but no increase of severe events. Satisfaction score improved from 30.5 ± 7.7 points to 38.3 ± 5.1 points (p = 0.018), was correlated with the reduction in and was higher in less controlled patients at inclusion. “Behaviour” score regarding hypoglycaemias decrease from 5.7 ± 4.1 to 4.4 ± 3.6 points (p < 0.001). In conclusion, this 18-months study trial indicates that using the FGM technology in patients with T1D may improve glycaemic control, in real-life conditions, especially in less controlled patients. FGM was associated with an increase of patients’ satisfaction regarding treatment. Hypoglycaemic events, however, were not reduced in frequency. Therefore, the need for an educational team and a structure program in the management of this new technology remains mandatory."

Administration of corticosteroids is common in obstetric practice. In this concise review we queried on the effects of corticosteroids in pregnancies complicated by SARS-CoV-2.
Methods
We performed a literature search on PubMed, regarding the use of corticosteroids in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, in pregnancies complicated by SARS-CoV-2, as well as their impact on glycemia in pregnant women with or without diabetes. Furthermore, we searched for effects of SARS-CoV-2 and of other coronaviridae on insulin secretion and glycemia.
Results
SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be a risk factor for complications in pregnancy. Corticosteroids may not be recommended for treating SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia but they may be needed for at-risk pregnancies. Corticosteroids in pregnancy have a diabetogenic potential. SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviridae may have effects on glycemia.
Conclusions
Caution should be exercised while using corticosteroids in pregnant women with COVID-19 requiring preterm delivery."

Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is a complaint with often unidentified reasons. Some medicines, including statins therapy, are anticipated to be amongst the reasons for PN.
Aims
This study intended to assess the association of peripheral neuropathy with statins therapy amongst Type 2 diabetic patients.
Methods
At Penang General Hospital, 757 cases were categorized into two groups (564 with statins therapy and 193 without statins therapy). The diagnosis of PN was investigated retrospectively for a period of 10 years (2006–2016). Confounding risk factors as age, diabetes period, hypertension, glycemic control, other co-morbidity, and prescriptions were matched.
Results
About 129 (22.9%) cases from 564 statins users had PN. Only 30 (15.5%) subjects had PN from 193 statins non-users. Chi-square test showed a significant variance among statins treatment cohort and statin-free cohort in the occurrence of PN (P-value: 0.001). Spearman’s investigation presented a positive correlation (r: 0.078, p-value: 0.031) among statins use and PN prevalence. Binary logistic regression was statistically significant for statins therapy as a predictor of peripheral neuropathy incidence (r2: 0.006, p-value: 0.027) amid diabetic patients. The relative risk of peripheral neuropathy connected with statins therapy is (RR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.02–2.11). The excess relative risk is 47.1%. While the absolute risk (AR) is 7.3% and the number needed to harm (NNH) is 14.
Conclusions
The study indicated a positive association between peripheral neuropathy and statins utilization. Peripheral neuropathy was higher amongst statins users than the statins-free group."

abstract = "It has been reported that frequent occurrence of COVID-19 infection in these patients is associated with low cytosolic pH. During virus infection, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level excessively rises. LDH is a cytosolic enzyme and the serum level increases as the cell break down. When anaerobic conditions develop, lactate formation increases from pyruvate. Cell pH is regulated by very complex mechanisms. When lactate increases in the extracellular area, this symporter carries lactate and H+ ion into the cell, and the intracellular pH quickly becomes acidic. Paradoxically, Na+/H+ exchanger activation takes place. While H+ ion is thrown out of the cell, Na+ and Ca+2 enter the cell. When Na+ and Ca+2 increase in the cell, the cells swell and die. Dapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor. Dapagliflozin has been reported to reduce lactate levels by various mechanisms. Also, it reduces oxygen consumption in tissues and causes the use of glucose in the aerobic pathway, thereby reducing lactate production. A lactate decrease in the environment reduces the activation of lactate/H+ symporter. Thus, the H ion pumping into the cell by this symporter is reduced and the cytosolic pH is maintained. Dapagliflozin also directly inhibits NHE. Thus, Na+ and Ca+2 flow to the cell are inhibited. Dapagliflozin provides the continuation of the structure and functions of the cells. Dapagliflozin can prevent the severe course of COVID-19 infection by preventing the lowering of cytosolic pH and reducing the viral load."

We systematically searched the PubMed database up till April 2, 2020 and retrieved all the articles published on SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV that dealt with viral dynamics.
Results
Ample data is available to suggest the differences in etiology, transmission cycle, diagnosis, genetics, hosts, reproductive rates, clinical features, laboratory diagnosis and radiological features between SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
Conclusion
Although SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is more infectious than SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, most infections are generally mild and self-limiting. However, case-fatality rates are very high in patients with COVID-19 with comorbidities, compared to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV."

Many patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have underlying cardiovascular (CV) disease or develop acute cardiac injury during the course of the illness. Adequate understanding of the interplay between COVID-19 and CV disease is required for optimum management of these patients.
Methods
A literature search was done using PubMed and Google search engines to prepare a narrative review on this topic.
Results
Respiratory illness is the dominant clinical manifestation of COVID-19; CV involvement occurs much less commonly. Acute cardiac injury, defined as significant elevation of cardiac troponins, is the most commonly reported cardiac abnormality in COVID-19. It occurs in approximately 8–12% of all patients. Direct myocardial injury due to viral involvement of cardiomyocytes and the effect of systemic inflammation appear to be the most common mechanisms responsible for cardiac injury. The information about other CV manifestations in COVID-19 is very limited at present. Nonetheless, it has been consistently shown that the presence of pre-existing CV disease and/or development of acute cardiac injury are associated with significantly worse outcome in these patients.
Conclusions
Most of the current reports on COVID-19 have only briefly described CV manifestations in these patients. Given the enormous burden posed by this illness and the significant adverse prognostic impact of cardiac involvement, further research is required to understand the incidence, mechanisms, clinical presentation and outcomes of various CV manifestations in COVID-19 patients."

This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of MetS and its correlation with comorbidities and health related quality of life (HRQoL) in South Indian patients with COPD.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted among the 76 COPD patients. Pulmonary function test (PFT) and parameters for MetS such as waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, triglycerides (TGs) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels of COPD patients were measured. HRQoL was calculated using Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).
Results
54% of COPD patients were presented with MetS especially in stage II and III. TGs and HDL-C were significantly associated with the severity of COPD (p < 0.05), while waist circumference, TGs and HDL-C were significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with PFT. Symptom, activity, impact and total scores of SGRQ was increased statistically (p < 0.05) in COPD patients with MetS than without MetS.
Conclusion
According to our findings, screening the grade II and III COPD patients for the presence of MetS is a reasonable option. The results of this study should be confirmed with a larger sample of population."

Materials and methods
A systematic search was conducted using Cochrane library. A simulation model was created using glycemic data from previous disasters (taken as similar in impact to current lockdown) taking baseline HBA1c and diabetes-related complications data from India-specific database. A multivariate regression analysis was conducted to analyse the relationship between the duration of lockdown and glycaemic targets & diabetes-related complications.
Results
The predictive model was extremely robust (R2 = 0.99) and predicted outcomes for period of lockdown up to 90 days. The predicted increment in HBA1c from baseline at the end of 30 days and 45 days lockdown was projected as 2.26% & 3.68% respectively. Similarly, the annual predicted percentage increase in complication rates at the end of 30-day lockdown was 2.8% for non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 2.9% for proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 1.5% for retinal photocoagulation, 9.3% for microalbuminuria, 14.2% for proteinuria, 2.9% for peripheral neuropathy, 10.5% for lower extremity amputation, 0.9% for myocardial infarction, 0.5% for stroke and 0.5% for infections.
Conclusion
The duration of lockdown is directly proportional to the worsening of glycaemic control and diabetes-related complications. Such increase in diabetes-related complications will put additional load on overburdened healthcare system, and also increase COVID19 infections in patients with such uncontrolled glycemia."

This suggests a prudent attitude including non-stringent control, despite which repeated hypoglycemia quite often occurs in such patients. When looking for possible sources of hypoglycemia, health professionals too often overlook the identification of skin lipodystrophy (LD) due to an incorrect insulin injection technique. This mini-review focuses on the high frequency (57%) of LD in a cohort of 1004 insulin-treated people with DM on dialysis consecutively referring to our joint medical centers, and on its relationship with hypoglycemia and glycemic control/variability. When taking on such patients, care team members accept to face a complex disease burdened with several risk factors requiring high professional skills, and have to keep in mind also the possible presence of any LD areas eventually interfering with expected results. A timely educational intervention on the correct injection technique can help reduce the high risk of hypoglycemia and large glycemic variability in dialysed people with DM."

COVID 19 (Coronavirus) pandemic has created surge demand for essential healthcare equipment, medicines along with the requirement for advance information technologies applications. Industry 4.0 is known as the fourth industrial revolution, which has the potential to fulfil customised requirement during COVID-19 crisis. This revolution has started with the applications of advance manufacturing and digital information technologies.
Methods
A detailed review of the literature is done on the technologies of Industry 4.0 and their applications in the COVID-19 pandemic, using appropriate search words on the databases of PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar and Research Gate.
Results
We found several useful technologies of Industry 4.0 which help for proper control and management of COVID-19 pandemic and these have been discussed in this paper. The available technologies of Industry 4.0 could also help the detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 and other related problems and symptoms.
Conclusions
Industry 4.0 can fulfil the requirements of customised face masks, gloves, and collect information for healthcare systems for proper controlling and treating of COVID-19 patients. We have discussed ten major technologies of Industry 4.0 which help to solve the problems of this virus. It is useful to provide day to day update of an infected patient, area-wise, age-wise and state-wise with proper surveillance systems. We also believe that the proper implementation of these technologies would help to enhance education and communication regarding public health. These Industry 4.0 technologies could provide a lot of innovative ideas and solution for fighting local and global medical emergencies."

abstract = "Aims
This study was designed to evaluate the meeting of ABC goals in patients with type 2 diabetes. The ABC goals were defined as meeting the HbA1c <7%, systolic blood pressure <130 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure <80 mmHg, and LDL-C <100 mg/dL. We also determined the associated factors with meeting the ABC goals, as well as the effectiveness of statin therapy.
Methods
We designed a cross-sectional study of 2008 type 2 diabetes patients attending the diabetes clinics of Valiasr Hospital of Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex. Meeting ABC goals and their associated factors were analyzed from the registered data.
Results
At the end of the year 2014, 61.3% of patients met the HbA1c goal, which increased to 77.8% in 2017. Blood pressure of 79.5% of patients met the ADA recommendations by the end of the year 2014, reaching 86.6% in 2017. Moreover, 84.5% and 93.8% could reach the LDL-C goal in 2014 and 2017, respectively. The proportion for the patients meeting all three ABC goals were 23.2% and 42.1% in 2014 and 2017, respectively.
Conclusions
The level of achievement of ABC goals in Iran is lower than expected and it requires a lot of programming effort and follow-up. As patients are followed over the years, controlling ABC becomes much more favorable."

To assess the age and its association with glycemic control (GC) among adults with type 2-diabetes in the United States.
Materials and materials
Data were collected from the National Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013–2014 (n = 697), cross-sectional national survey adults with Type2 diabetes. Characteristics included retinopathy diagnosis, blood pressure, albumin-creatinine ratio, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), BMI, cholesterol, smoking status, pills/insulin, exercise, age, age at diagnosis, education, sex, race, and marital status. Diabetes preventive behaviors were included. Predictors of GC were assessed using logistic regression.
Results
The mean age was 61 (SD ±13); the average age at diagnosis 50 (SD ±12.9) and women (51%). Age ≥60, diabetes length >10yrs, taking pills/on insulin, albumin-creatinine ratio ≤30mg/g, optimal BP, no retinopathy diagnosis, optimal cholesterol, seeing a doctor for diabetes, doctors checkup ≥2 times and checking HbA1c annually were significant predictors of GC. The association between GC and age (OR=.97, p<.001; CI: .96-.98) diabetes length >10yrs (OR=1.55, p<.05; CI: 1.02-2.34), creatinine-albumin ratio ≤30mg/g (OR=1.97, p<.001; CI: 1.32-2.94) and checking HbA1c annually (OR=1.86, p<.01; CI: 1.16-3.00) remained significant after adjustment for the effects of all other statistically significant covariates.
Conclusions
GC was prevalent among older individuals; suggestive of intervention programs for young adults with diabetes and continuous HbA1c assessment at least annually."

Although diabetes mellitus (DM) is no longer considered “coronary heart disease risk equivalent”, the risk remains sufficiently high, necessitating early recognition and management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in these patients. Despite this understanding, the optimum strategy for prediction and early detection of CVD in DM remains debatable.
Methods
Major societal guidelines for prediction and evaluation of CVD in subjects with or without DM were reviewed. Available evidence about various risk stratification strategies-their advantages, disadvantages and current role in clinical practice-were extensively reviewed. Special emphasis was placed on evidence from South Asian/Indian populations.
Results
The inconsistency and variability inherent to the clinical risk algorithms, lack of consensus regarding the incremental value of subclinical atherosclerosis imaging and the lack of sufficient data to demonstrate the benefits of recognizing asymptomatic atherosclerotic disease are some of the reasons underlying prevailing uncertainty about the optimum approach for cardiovascular risk assessment in DM. These challenges notwithstanding, an evidence-based cardiovascular risk stratification strategy incorporating clinical risk algorithms, biomarkers, atherosclerosis imaging, and cardiac stress testing is proposed.
Conclusions
The proposed algorithm should help clinicians in optimizing cardiovascular evaluation and management of their patients with DM. However, this remains a dynamic field; further research into different risk assessment tools, esp. focusing on their impact on improving clinical outcomes, should help refine the evaluation strategy in future."

Methods
PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane and MedRxiv database were searched using the specific keywords up to April 30, 2020. Studies that met our objectives were assessed for the risk of bias applying various tools as indicated. Three studies each that reported the outcome of viral clearance by RT-PCR and death due to all cause, were meta-analyzed by applying inverse variance-weighted averages of logarithmic risk ratio (RR) using a random effects model. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed using the I2 statistic and funnel plots, respectively.
Results
Meta-analysis of 3 studies (n = 210) on viral clearance assessed by RT-PCR showed no benefit (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.38; p = 0.74), although with a moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 61.7%, p = 0.07). While meta-analysis of 3 studies (n = 474) showed a significant increase in death with HCQ, compared to the control (RR, 2.17; 95% 1.32 to 3.57; p = 0.002), without any heterogeneity (I2 = 0.0%, p = 0.43).

Health related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important public health issue that mainly associated with a number of certain factors in medical sciences. This study, in particular, aimed to identify HRQoL latent subgroups among patients with type 2 diabetes and assess the role that household food insecurity (HFI) plays in classifying participants to each latent class.
Methods
At the present cross sectional study, all the diabetic patients of the rural regions of Neyshabur (a city in north-east of Iran) were recruited between April and July 2012 (N = 1847). Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was used to determine the latent subgroups of HRQoL. Finally, LCA was used to determine the effect of HFI on dedicating participants to each latent class after adjusting other covariates.
Results
Based on the subscales of HRQoL, three latent classes were identified, including: 1) poor HRQoL (34.6%), 2) moderate HRQoL (39.1%) and 3) good HRQoL (26.3%). After considering the possible confounders, having HFI decrease the odds of membership in latent class 2 (moderate HRQoL) (OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.29–0.60). Also having HFI show similar effect on latent class 3 (good HRQoL) and decrease the odds of membership in this class (OR = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.08–0.20) in compared to the first class (poor HRQoL).
Conclusions
Results from the present study show that HFI plays an important role in decreasing the odds of membership in moderate and good HRQoL classes compared to poor HRQoL."

Diabetes mellitus affects approximately 8.5% of the world’s population with the majority of cases diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Impaired awareness or denial of T2DM is a common yet understudied construct that may negatively contribute to clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to develop the Diabetes Awareness and Insight Scale (DAS), a self-report scale that measures illness awareness in persons with T2DM.
Methods
Nine items were developed for the DAS that measure four domains of illness awareness, namely General Illness Awareness, Accurate Symptom Attribution, Awareness of Need for Treatment, and Awareness of Negative Consequences attributable to T2DM (www.illnessawarenessscales.com). A total of 100 participants with a diagnosis of T2DM were recruited using a digital data collection platform.
Results
The DAS demonstrated good convergent and discriminant validity, internal consistency, and one-month test-retest reliability. An exploratory factor analysis showed that the DAS exhibited three factors.
Conclusions
Overall, the DAS is a novel and easy-to-administer scale that comprehensively measures subjective illness awareness in persons with T2DM. As the first scale of its kind, the DAS holds promise for use in epidemiology studies to examine the extent to which impaired illness awareness or illness denial contributes to clinical outcomes and T2DM management."

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic multi-systemic metabolic disorder; diabetic patients are more prone to xerostomia and oral health problems than others. There are evidences that nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in healthy salivary gland function, prevention of insulin resistance and progression of diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to compare the salivary NO level between type 2 diabetic (T2DM) patients with and without xerostomia.
Methods
In this case control study, 70 patients with T2DM, which were matched according to age, sex, type of disease control, were enrolled conveniently. The subjects based on abeslang test were allocated to the two groups; 35 patients with xerostomia and 35 patients without xerostomia. Unstimulated whole saliva was collected by spitting method. NO levels was measured by ELISA method using Griess reaction. Data was analyzed using t-test, ANOVA and logistic regression analysis to examine the association of salivary NO and xerostomia.
Results
The mean and standard deviation of salivary NO in the diabetic subjects with xerostomia was significantly lower than diabetic subjects without xerostomia (138 ± 94.58 μmol/L vs. 356.61 ± 302.81 μmol/L (P-value = 0.001). In logistic regression analysis, salivary NO level was associated with 0.994 fold decreased risk of xerostomia in diabetic subjects after adjustment for age, gender, FBS and HbA1c.

Methods
In a cross-sectional study of 256 patients with metabolic syndrome (157 men, 99 women), the cardiovascular disease risk was evaluated using the FRS scoring system by a pre-defined computerized algorithm. Psychological distress was also assessed by general health questionnaire (GHQ)-12. Evaluation of the biochemical parameters including fasting serum glucose (FSG), lipid profile, liver enzymes and adiponectin concentrations were also performed using the enzymatic methods.
Results
The prevalence of low, intermediate and high risk of CVD in men was significantly higher than women (P < 0.05). Both genders in high risk of CVD had significantly higher age, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and FSG concentrations compared with male and females in intermediate and low risk of CVD (P < 0.05). In multiple logistic regression, being single was in the highest relationship with high psychological distress values compared with married or divorced/separated marital status. Moreover, high SBP and low high density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations were also potent determinants of high psychological distress (P < 0.05).
Conclusions
In the current study, the prevalence of CVD risk factors were higher in men compared with women. Moreover, higher age, SBP and FSG were potent determinants of FRS in both genders. Marital status and serum HDL were in relation with psychological distress among patients with metabolic syndrome."

abstract = "Background
New evidence indicates that overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines is responsible for the development of diabetes difficulties. Some herbals such as saffron, may control inflammation and improve the hyperglycemic states in diabetic patients. Therefore, this investigation aimed to assess the effects of saffron supplementation on fasting glucose and inflammatory markers levels in patients with type2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Methods
In this randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 60 T2DM patients were randomly assigned into two groups as saffron and placebo (n = 30) receiving 100 mg/day saffron powder or starch capsules (1 capsule) for a duration of 8 weeks. Fasting blood sample was collected at baseline and at the end of the intervention. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) was immediately analyzed by the auto-analyzer. The serum level of Interleukin −6 (IL-6), Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and Interleukin-10 (IL-10) were measured using ELISA assay by laboratory kits. Also, Real-time quantitative reverse transcription (RT-PCR) assay measured the expression level of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 at the mRNA level.
Results
Saffron supplementation significantly decreased the FBG levels within 8 weeks compared to placebo (130.93 ± 21.21 vs 135.13 ± 23.03 mg/dl, P = 0.012). Moreover, the serum level of TNF-α notably reduced in the saffron group compared to the placebo group (114.40 ± 24.28 vs 140.90 ± 25.49 pg/ml, P < 0.001). Also, saffron supplementation significantly down-regulated the expressions of TNF-α (P = 0.035) and IL-6 mRNA levels (P = 0.014).
Conclusion
In our study, it was indicated that saffron modulates glucose levels as well as inflammation status in T2DM patients through decreasing the expressions levels of some inflammatory mediators. Also, further investigations are necessary to confirm the positive effects of saffron as a complementary therapy for T2DM patients."

Necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) of the upper extremities is a rare, but potentially life-threatening infection in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We analyzed the clinical characteristics and the outcome of NSTI of upper extremities in these patients.
Methods
This was a retrospective study analyzing the clinical characteristics and the outcomes of 33 T2DM patients with NSTI of upper extremities, who were treated in the department of hand surgery between January 2011 and December 2017.
Results
Predisposing factors for NSTI were recognized in 16 (48.5%) patients. Eleven (33.3)% patients had septic shock while ten (30.3%) had acute renal insufficiency at the time of presentation, of which six required dialysis. The mean glycosylated hemoglobin was 9.6(±2.6)% and the random plasma glucose at admission was 271(±96) mg/dl. Monomicrobial infection was seen in 16(49%) patients and polymicrobial infection in 9(27%) patients. Gram-positive causation was found in 25(66%) patients. Twelve (36.4%) patients required amputation, six (18.2%) of which were major. Death occurred in more than one-fifth (21.2%) of the patients during treatment.
Conclusion
Necrotizing soft tissue infection of the upper extremities in T2DM is associated with increased risk of severe infection, amputation and mortality."

Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is chronic conditions with devastating multi-systemic complication and may be associated with severe form of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to investigate the association between DM and poor outcome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.
Methods
Systematic literature search was performed from several electronic databases on subjects that assess DM and outcome in COVID-19 pneumonia. The outcome of interest was composite poor outcome, including mortality, severe COVID-19, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), need for intensive care unit (ICU) care, and disease progression.
Results
There were a total of 6452 patients from 30 studies. Meta-analysis showed that DM was associated with composite poor outcome (RR 2.38 [1.88, 3.03], p < 0.001; I2: 62%) and its subgroup which comprised of mortality (RR 2.12 [1.44, 3.11], p < 0.001; I2: 72%), severe COVID-19 (RR 2.45 [1.79, 3.35], p < 0.001; I2: 45%), ARDS (RR 4.64 [1.86, 11.58], p = 0.001; I2: 9%), and disease progression (RR 3.31 [1.08, 10.14], p = 0.04; I2: 0%). Meta-regression showed that the association with composite poor outcome was influenced by age (p = 0.003) and hypertension (p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that the association was weaker in studies with median age ≥55 years-old (RR 1.92) compared to <55 years-old (RR 3.48), and in prevalence of hypertension ≥25% (RR 1.93) compared to <25% (RR 3.06). Subgroup analysis on median age <55 years-old and prevalence of hypertension <25% showed strong association (RR 3.33)

We tried to find the current role, availability and need of ventilators in the COVID-19 pandemic and the role of applied innovative technologies is assessed.
Methods
We have done a comprehensive review of the literature using suitable keywords on the search engines of PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar and Research Gate in the second week of April 2020.
Results
We found in our review that there is an acute shortage of the ventilators and the manpower to operate these sophisticated machines. There is significant deficiency in the production and supply chain of the ventilators. Many of the seriously ill patients who require hospitalization may need ventilator support. Non-invasive ventilation is not recommended in these patients.
Conclusion
As the respiratory illness due to COVID-19 pandemic spreads worldwide, health care systems are facing the tough challenges of acquiring ventilators to support patients. All steps involved in the supply chain management of ventilators are being escalated to produce more ventilators for the coronavirus frontline. Innovative applications of Additive medicine like 3-D printer technology may play key role in delivering sufficient ventilators."

Remdesivir is a broad spectrum anti-viral drug that has shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, in vitro and in vivo. In absence of any effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), remdesivir has been tried for a compassionate use in severe COVID-19. Newer randomized controlled studies that have recently become available, showed a mixed result. We aimed to systematically search the literature to understand the pharmacology and clinical effects of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19.
Methods
We systematically searched the PubMed, ClinicalTrial.Org and MedRxiv database up till May 5, 2020 using specific key words such as “Remdesivir” or ‘GS-5734″ AND “COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2” and retrieved all the article published in English language, that have reported the pharmacology and the clinical outcomes of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19.
Results
Initial compassionate use of remdesivir has shown a fairly good result, but difficult to quantify, in the absence of control arm. While the very first double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial conducted in Wuhan, did not find any significant benefit compared to the control, the preliminary result of another similar multi-country trial has shown a significant faster time to recovery but without any difference in mortality.
Conclusions
Remdesivir has shown a mixed result in patients with COVID-19 with an acceptable side effect. However, jury is still out while awaiting the results from the forthcoming trials."

Transcription factor 7 like 2 (TCF7L-2) polymorphism has been associated with adipocyte metabolism and insulin resistance. Genetic investigations of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and atherosclerosis are unknown. This study was designed to investigate the association of rs7903146 (C/T) polymorphism of TCF7L-2 gene with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in Asian Indians.
Methods
In this case-control study 162 non-diabetic subjects with NAFLD and 173 body mass index (BMI)-matched controls without NAFLD were recruited. Abdominal ultrasound, clinical and biochemical investigations, fasting insulin levels and value of homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was measured. Single nucleotide polymorphism rs7903146 (C/T) was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphisms.
Results
The distribution of rs7903146 (C/T) alleles, the dominant model (CT + TT) and higher frequency (31%) of C/T genotype were significantly associated with NAFLD. C/T genotype of TCF7L2 gene was associated with significantly higher levels of BMI (p = 0.02), abdominal obesity (p < 0.05), fasting blood glucose (p = 0.05), hepatic transaminases (p < 0.05) and markers of insulin resistance (p < 0.05) in subjects with NAFLD. Using a multivariate analysis after adjusting for age and sex, TCF7L2 polymorphism was independently associated with presence of NAFLD [(OR: 3.234 (95% CI: 1.219-4.160, p = 0.002)].
Conclusion
TCF7L2 (C/T) gene was Independently associated with NAFLD in Asian Indians."

COVID-19 is already a pandemic. Emerging data suggest an increased association and a heightened mortality in patients of COVID-19 with comorbidities. We aimed to evaluate the outcome in hypertensive patients with COVID-19 and its relation to the use of renin-angiotensin system blockers (RASB).
Methods
We have systematically searched the medical database up to March 27, 2020 and retrieved all the published articles in English language related to our topic using MeSH key words.
Results
From the pooled data of all ten available Chinese studies (n = 2209) that have reported the characteristics of comorbidities in patients with COVID-19, hypertension was present in nearly 21%, followed by diabetes in nearly 11%, and established cardiovascular disease (CVD) in approximately 7% of patients. Although the emerging data hints to an increase in mortality in COVID-19 patients with known hypertension, diabetes and CVD, it should be noted that it was not adjusted for multiple confounding factors. Harm or benefit in COVID-19 patients receiving RASB has not been typically assessed in these studies yet, although mechanistically and plausibly both, benefit and harm is possible with these agents, given that COVID-19 expresses to tissues through the receptor of angiotensin converting enzyme-2.
Conclusion
Special attention is definitely required in patients with COVID-19 with associated comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes and established CVD. Although the role of RASB has a mechanistic equipoise, patients with COVID-19 should not stop these drugs at this point of time, as recommended by various world organizations and without the advice of health care provider."

Outcomes after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery have improved due to advances in surgical technique and post-operative care. We aimed to describe contemporary clinical characteristics and short-term post-operative outcomes in diabetic patients undergoing CABG surgery.
Methods
A retrospective analysis of patients who underwent CABG surgery over a 4.5-year period in a Western Australian tertiary hospital was performed in September 2019. The cohort was stratified according to pre-operative diabetes status.
Results
A total of 1327 patients underwent CABG surgery, of which 572 (43.1%) had diabetes.

abstract = "Background
Many studies on COVID-19 have reported diabetes to be associated with severe disease and mortality, however, the data is conflicting. The objectives of this meta-analysis were to explore the relationship between diabetes and COVID-19 mortality and severity, and to determine the prevalence of diabetes in patients with COVID-19.
Methods
We searched the PubMed for case-control studies in English, published between Jan 1 and Apr 22, 2020, that had data on diabetes in patients with COVID-19. The frequency of diabetes was compared between patients with and without the composite endpoint of mortality or severity. Random effects model was used with odds ratio as the effect size. We also determined the pooled prevalence of diabetes in patients with COVID-19. Heterogeneity and publication bias were taken care by meta-regression, sub-group analyses, and trim and fill methods.
Results
We included 33 studies (16,003 patients) and found diabetes to be significantly associated with mortality of COVID-19 with a pooled odds ratio of 1.90 (95% CI: 1.37–2.64; p < 0.01). Diabetes was also associated with severe COVID-19 with a pooled odds ratio of 2.75 (95% CI: 2.09–3.62; p < 0.01). The combined corrected pooled odds ratio of mortality or severity was 2.16 (95% CI: 1.74–2.68; p < 0.01). The pooled prevalence of diabetes in patients with COVID-19 was 9.8% (95% CI: 8.7%–10.9%) (after adjusting for heterogeneity).
Conclusions
Diabetes in patients with COVID-19 is associated with a two-fold increase in mortality as well as severity of COVID-19, as compared to non-diabetics. Further studies on the pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic implications need to be done."

Retrospective evaluation of the clinical and analytical data of patients who were admitted due to DFI in 2010–2011 (group 2010/11) and 2016–2017 (group 2016/17). Only the first hospitalization for each patient was included. An adequate descriptive and comparative statistical analysis was performed.
Results
There were 274 admissions due to DFI, 151 in 2010/11 and 123 in 2016/17. There was an increase in admissions due to neuroischemic DFI (51.0% in 2010/11 to 61.8% in 2016/17, p = 0.048). Staphylococcus aureus (SA) was the most common isolate in 2010/11 (26.7%). In 2016/17 most cultures were mixed polymicrobial and isolation of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased from 2010/11 to 2016/17 (15.9% to 30.6%, p = 0.001, and 9.1% to 13.7%, p = 0.048, respectively).
Conclusion
There was an increase in the prevalence of neuroischemic DFU. The Enterobacteriaceae family replaced SA as the most prevalent pathogen in DFI, with an increase in the isolation of gram-negative microorganisms and mixed polymicrobial cultures. Chronic neuroischemic infected ulcers usually present distinct bacterial isolates; knowledge about the most common agents is warranted in order to better select empiric antibiotic therapy."

As a result of its rapid spread in various countries around the world, on March 11, 2020, WHO issued an announcement of the change in coronavirus disease 2019 status from epidemic to pandemic disease. The virus that causes this disease is indicated originating from animals traded in a live animal market in Wuhan, China. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 can attack lung cells because there are many conserved receptor entries, namely Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2. The presence of this virus in host cells will initiate various protective responses leading to pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. This review aimed to provide an overview related to this virus and examine the body’s responses and possible therapies.
Method
We searched PubMed databases for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2, Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus. Full texts were retrieved, analyzed and developed into an easy-to-understand review.
Results
We provide a complete review related to structure, origin, and how the body responds to this virus infection and explain the possibility of an immune system over-reaction or cytokine storm. We also include an explanation of how this virus creates modes of avoidance to evade immune system attacks. We further explain the therapeutic approaches that can be taken in the treatment and prevention of this viral infection.
Conclusion
In summary, based on the structural and immune-evasion system of coronavirus, we suggest several approaches to treat the disease."

Lack of awareness of the disease, its complications, combined with lack of financial resources among the underprivileged, often results in late detection and more complications in them. To combat this, healthcare delivered at the doorstep through the use of a customised mobile medical van is a potentially attractive option. We used a customized mobile van (included trained personnel, glucose meters, fundus evaluation camera, apparatus for detection of neuropathy and foot circulation and net enabled Skype calling for remote consultation) for educating general population regarding healthy lifestyle and screening, management and intervention in patients with diabetes. The project covered 10 underprivileged areas (n, 2,31,000 people) in Delhi. Total of 24,072 individuals (10.9% of total population) attended 352 awareness sessions. A total 3,12,347 visits (included repeat visits) were carried out for screening, education and management for obesity and diabetes. During screening (n, 16,834), 2933 subjects (18.7%) had high random blood glucose levels (>200 mg/dL) and had a blood pressure averaging 127.1 ± 23.6/81.3 ± 16.6 mm of mercury (n, 16,339). A pre-post intensive lifestyle counselling for 6 months in a subset of 352 diabetic patients (of which 77.8% i.e. n, 274 were overweight/obese) showed a significant lowering in weight (p < 0.001). In addition, 292 frontline workers and 256 paramedical workers were given training regarding lifestyle and diabetes, over 20 sessions. Based on achievements of this project of spreading awareness, screening, and management of diabetes and obesity in the large number of individuals in urban underprivileged colony, we believe this project could be extended to other cities and rural areas of India, and to other developing countries as well."

To evaluate the association between elevated body fat percent (BF%) and the prevalence of insulin resistance (IR) in the adult population with body mass index (BMI) in the normal values.
Methods
We carry out an analytical cross-sectional study. The participants attended outpatient from 2012 to 2016 in a private clinic in Lima-Peru between 18 and 60 years with a BMI between 19 and 24.9/Kg/m2. We defined elevated BF% if the values were greater than 25% in men and 30% in women and IR with a cut-off point of HOMA-IR based in the 75th percentile. We performed a generalized linear model from family Poisson (crude and adjusted) with robust standard errors to evaluate the association between BF% and the IR. We reported as association measure the prevalence ratio (PR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (CI).
Results
We included 284 participants, the average age was 33.77 ± 10.86 (SD) years and the percentage of women was 88.1%. The prevalence of elevated BF% was 71.13% and the prevalence of IR was 25%. We found an association between the elevated BF% and IR, PR = 3.17; 95% CI: 1.46–6.91.
Conclusions
Body fat percentage seems to be a good indicator of IR in patients with normal BMI and without endocrine comorbidities. Longitudinal prospective studies are recommended to corroborate our findings."

This study investigates the association of two potential Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) gene polymorphisms (rs9939609 and rs918031) as potential predictors of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in obese Iraqi population and their metabolic effects on hyperglycemia and insulin sensitivity.
Materials & methods
The study included 400 participants with obesity & T2D, with a matching 400 obese non-diabetic cohort. Venous blood samples were collected for DNA extraction. Using specific primers and restriction enzymes, genotyping was performed to identify the various alleles for each gene. The genotype and allele frequencies determined by multinomial logistic regression analysis for FTO single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs9939609) among all the study groups.
Results
There is a two-fold increase in the risk of T2D within the homozygous genotype (TT) group (OR = 2.43, CI 95% 3.57–11.2, P ≤ 0.001) as compared to the wild type (TA). In addition, there was a significantly higher level of the minor allele genotype (T) in T2D patients when compared to the control group, (P ≤ 0.001).
Conclusion
We conclude that the FTO rs9939609 genotype significantly affect the development of insulin resistance, therefore the future occurrence of T2D, in obese individuals."

To identify the prevalence of micro- and macro-vascular complications and their associated factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus in Bangladesh.
Methods
This retrospective and cross-sectional study was conducted in six diabetes hospitals, covered urban and rural population. From April to September in 2017, a total of 1253 type 2 diabetes patients aged ≥18 years were recruited. Participants answered a pre-tested electronic questionnaire, and their medical records were reviewed for documented diabetes complications.
Results
Mean age was 55.1 (±12.6) years. Among macrovascular complications, the prevalence of coronary artery disease was found to be 30.5%, 10.1% for stroke and 12.0% for diabetic foot. Among microvascular complications, nephropathy was prevalent among 34.2%, retinopathy among 25.1% and neuropathy among 5.8% of patients. Risk factors found to be associated with one or more of the complications were female gender, higher age, lower education level, an urban area of residence, higher household income, smoking, physical inactivity, hypertension, poor glycaemic control, poor adherence to treatment, longer duration of diabetes, and insulin use.
Conclusion
Diabetes complications are highly prevalent among type 2 diabetes population in Bangladesh. Prevention strategies should focus on increasing physical activity, weight loss, smoking cessation, and more strict control of hypertension and glycaemic level."

Oxidative stress (OS) plays a major role in pathogenic mechanisms associated with metabolic syndrome (Mets) yet the main component of Mets contributing most to OS is not well elucidated. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate the oxidative-antioxidative status in Mets subjects and to determine the main predicting component of OS.
Methods
Anthropometric measures, fasting blood glucose, lipid profile, antioxidant enzymes [catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)], reduced glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl were assessed in 172 adult UAE residents. International Diabetes Federation criteria were used for Mets diagnosis. Mets Scores (0–5) were calculated and assigned per subject based on number of components.
Results
Of all participants, 22.1% had Mets and 49.4% had large waist circumference (WC). Significant lower levels of catalase, SOD, GPx and GSH, and higher levels of MDA and protein carbonyl were observed in subjects with Mets. In addition, catalase, SOD, GPx, and GSH correlated negatively, while MDA and protein carbonyl correlated positively with almost all Mets components. Similar trend of correlations was noticed with Mets Scores. When adjusted for age and gender, linear regression analysis revealed that subjects with large WC demonstrated significantly lower levels of antioxidative enzymes and GSH, and higher levels of MDA and protein carbonyl. Consequently, WC emerged as the best predictor of OS.
Conclusions
The degree of OS is dependent on the Mets Scores, and WC contributes independently to increased OS among adults in UAE."

abstract = "Aim
Diabetic patients predispose to vascular diseases such as nephropathy, and retinopathy. Poor adherence to medical treatment and dietary recommendations in uncontrolled diabetes leads to vascular damages. Vitamin D has been extensively studied and found to be protective against diabetes mellitus. YKL-40 and Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) are considered to exert crucial role in diabetes and its complications. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate effects of vitamin D supplementation on serum levels of YKL-40 and MCP-1 involved in the development of diabetic complications.
Methods
For 12 weeks, 48 type 2 diabetic patients enrolled in the trial and randomly were divided into two groups (n = 24 per group), receiving one of the following: 100 μg (4000 IU) vitamin D or placebo. Before and after intervention, serumYKL-40, MCP-1, insulin, IL-6, TNF-α, 25- (OH) vitamin D and HbA1c were measured.
Results
Our results revealed that serum levels of 25 (OH) vitamin D significantly increased in vitamin D group (p < 0.001). Vitamin D supplementation also significantly reduced serum YKL-40 levels (−22.7 vs. −2.4 ng/ml; (p-value = 0.003)). There was a significant decline in MCP-1 concentration in intervention group at the end of the study (−45.7 vs. −0.9 pg/ml; (p = 0.001)). Furthermore, there was a significant decrease in IL-6, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR in intervention group after 3 months supplementation.
Conclusions
Daily vitamin D supplementation effectively reduced circulatory YKL-40 and MCP-1 levels in patients with type-2 diabetes and vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D might contribute in reducing diabetic complications via modulating YKL-40 and MCP-1 signaling pathways."

This study aims to estimate the prevalence of depression and anxiety among Iranian patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) through meta-analysis.
Methods
This is a systematic review article based on MOOSE and PRISMA guidelines. Review of the literature was done using databases including Magiran, Barakat Knowledge Network System, SID, RICST, IranDoc, PubMed/Medline, Science Direct, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and the Google Scholar search engine without time limit until December, 2018. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using Cochran's Q test and I2 index. Data were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software version 2 according to a random-effects model. P-values less than 0.05 were considered as the significance level.
Results
The analysis consisted of 44 studies including 10,349 Iranian patients with DM. The prevalence of depression was estimated to be 61.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 56.6–66.7). The lowest and highest prevalence of depression based on regions was in the North (56.7% [95%CI: 44.9–67.8]) and the East (64.2% [95%CI: 30.7–87.9]), respectively. The depression prevalence in females and males was 63.9% (95%CI: 54.0–72.8) and 46.3% (95%CI: 36.4–56.4), respectively, The prevalence of mild, moderate, severe and highly severe depression was estimated to be 24.4% (95%CI: 21.0–28.2), 19.1% (95%CI: 15.2–23.9), 11.4% (95%CI: 8.6–14.9), and 4.6% (95%CI: 3.4–6.1), respectively. In eight studies, the prevalence of anxiety in Iranian patients with DM was estimated to be 64.5% (95%CI: 42.0–82.1).
Conclusions
Depression and anxiety are more prevalent among Iranian patients with DM compared with developed countries. Therefore, regular psychiatric consultation is required for the early diagnosis and treatment of depression and anxiety in these patients."

abstract = "Background
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common female endocrinopathy among premenopausal women associated with hyperandrogenism, obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and inflammation. Oxidative stress is an important component of cardio-metabolic risk seen in PCOS.
Material and methods
A total of 95 women with PCOS and 95 healthy controls were included in this observational study. Serum PON1 activity and stress markers were measured by spectrophotometric methods. Circulating TF level was measured by ELISA.
Results
We found decreased PON1 activity and increased TF levels in women with PCOS compared to healthy controls. Fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, testosterone, LDL-C, MDA, PC and SOD activity were significantly increased whereas FGIR, QUICKI, HDLC, CAT and TAC were significantly decreased in PCOS women than controls. We observed a positive association of PON1 activity with FGIR, QUICKI, HDL-C and TAC, and its negative association was observed with LH, testosterone, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR in PCOS women. We further observed a positive association of TF with waist, waist to hip ratio, BMI, glucose 1hr, cholesterol, LDL-C, SGPT, uric acid and SOD activity in PCOS women.
Conclusions
Decreased PON1 activity and raised circulating TF levels are respective indicators of pro-inflammatory and procoagulant status in PCOS women. The imbalanced oxidant/antioxidant status further supports the evidences that PCOS is an oxidant state. Further, the association of PON1 activity and TF levels with the clinical, laboratory findings and stress marker levels suggest that these factors taken together are involved in aggravating the pro-inflammatory status in PCOS women."

Following T2DM, dyslipidemia is known well for the main reason of vascular complication leading to atherosclerosis and impaired life expectancy in diabetes. Thus, a new prediction marker in T2DM could help prevent the progression disease despite of metabolic control. Signal peptide–CUB-EGF like containing protein 2 (SCUBE2), has been detected in vascular endothelium and was affected by cytokines. Recently, SCUBE2 was reported to increase in atherosclerotic human coronary artery, involving vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and macrophages. The aims of this study were to examine the expression level of SCUBE2 in T2DM patients with dyslipidemia and its correlation with endothelial dysfunction marker, endothelin-1 (ET-1) in this group. This study design was cross sectional control study, recruited 28 patients diagnosed as T2DM who were found with dyslipidemia and 15 healthy control subjects. Our results showed that T2DM patients showed higher LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and ET-1 expression level compared to healthy subjects. Further, we found that SCUBE2 had strong correlation with ET-1 in these dyslipidemic T2DM patients. In conclusion, our study confirmed first that SCUBE2 was upregulated in T2DM with dyslipidemia. Moreover, Pearson correlation analysis of ET-1 and SCUBE2 in this group showed high correlation r = 0.797, P < 0.001, suggesting that SCUBE2 may plausible target in vascular function changes in dyslipidemic T2DM. Improving our exploration of these findings may lead to uncover SCUBE2 involvement in diabetic vascular complication in T2DM."

abstract = "Aim
The aim of this work was to study overweight and obesity and their associated complications according to obesity indicators in a population of Tangier.
Methods
A total of 480 overweight and obese patients were included in this study, referred to hospital Duc Tovar of Tangier during a period of 12 months. The collection of data has been done through a questionnaire which included anthropometric, clinical and biochemical characteristics of each patient. Statistical analyses included chi2 test, student's t-test, ANOVA, and multiple linear regression analyses.
Results
The mean age of our patients was 45.56 ± 12.23 years, the mean body mass index (BMI) was 33.97 ± 5.84 Kg/m2 and the average waist circumference (WC) was 109.78 ± 15.42 cm. Overweight affected 25.2% and obesity 74.8%, whose 88.8% of subjects had abdominal obesity. All the metabolic abnormalities were significantly associated with abdominal obesity (measured by WC). However, only total cholesterol (p₌0.001) and triglycerides (p₌0.000) were significantly associated with different classes of obesity (measured by BMI). The most common complications of obesity and overweight were: type 2 diabetes (56.8%), arterial hypertension (52%), dyslipidaemia (43.9%), and cardiovascular disease (CVD) (24.3%). Hypertension and hyperglycaemia were the major risk factors for developing CVD with OR = 3.81 (95% CI:1.363–10.698; p < 0.05) and OR = 2.610 (95% CI:1.648–4.133; p < 0.001) respectively.
Conclusion
Obesity exposes to several chronic complications, the most important in our study were type 2 diabetes and hypertension; these complications increased significantly with abdominal obesity that has constituted important risk factors of CVD."

Our objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of curcumin on serum adiponectin concentration.
Methods
We searched PubMed/Medline, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google scholar databases up to April 2019. RCTs conducted among human adults studied the effects of curcumin on serum adiponectin concentrations as an outcome variable was included. The weighted mean differences (WMD) and standard deviations (SD) of change in serum adiponectin levels were calculated. The random effects model was used for deriving a summary of mean estimates with their corresponding SDs.
Results
Out of 313 records, 6 trials that enrolled 652 subjects were included. The pooled results showed that curcumin supplementation significantly increased adiponectin concentrations in comparison with placebo (WMD: 0.82 Hedges' g; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.33 to 1.30, P˂0.001). Greater effects on adiponectin were observed in trials lasting ≤10 weeks (WMD: 1.05 Hedges’ g; 95% CI: 0.64 to 1.45, P˂0.001).
Conclusion
Curcumin significantly improves adiponectin concentrations. However, due to some limitations in this study, further studies are needed to reach a definitive conclusion about the effect of curcumin on the levels of adiponectin."

Recently, youth intake of added sugar has been growing. The incidence of obesity and type 2 diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) has risen dramatically in parallel with these changes. Excess added sugar is a key risk factor for weight gain and T2DM in many cohort studies. The current study was implemented to examine the nutritional knowledge, attitude and practice pattern among UAE undergraduates.
Method
Random sampling was used to approach 400 undergraduate students from UAE. The data analysis was performed by using SPSS version 24. A correlation analysis was performed using Pearson and Spearman correlation tests. Statistical analysis was conducted using Chi-square test, T-test, and Kruskal Wallis test.
Results
Added sugar consumption is widely prevalent among university students in UAE. Only 19% of the enrolled sample scored high nutritional knowledge level and 56% of the students were considered heavy consumers. White sugar was the preferred added sweeteners among 90% of the sample.
Conclusion
Our study outcomes recommend that strategies that can successfully reduce added sugar might be a significant stage concerning reversing the devastating escalating trends in diabetes, obesity, and promoting health of all populations in UAE."

Noteworthily, diabetes mellitus (DM) and poorly controlled blood glucose increase the risk of mortality and severity of COVID-19. Intravenous (IV) insulin administration with hourly monitoring of blood glucose is the ideal approach in managing patients with hyperglycemic crisis, but it is not judicious to be applied in developing countries where shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) is a major issue. Furthermore, increasing the probability of “already greater risks” for doctors or other healthcare workers contracting COVID-19 seems inappropriate. Thus, an alternative administration strategy and more moderate glucose monitoring to reduce the contact exposure of healthcare workers with COVID-19 patients, by ensuring appropriate blood glucose levels, needs to be performed in this critical pandemic era. Subcutaneous (SC) rapid-acting insulin analog administration could presumably be a solution to this contentious issue."

The aims of this study was to study the impact of resveratrol supplementation in adjunct with non-surgical periodontal therapy on inflammatory, antioxidant, and periodontal markers in patients with type 2 diabetes with periodontal disease.
Materials and methods
In this randomized clinical trial, 43 patients with diabetes and chronic periodontitis were randomly allocated into two intervention and control groups receiving either resveratrol supplements or placebo for 4 weeks. Serum levels of interleukin 6 (IL6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and clinical attachment loss (CAL) as the main index of periodontal marker were measured pre-intervention and post-intervention.
Results
In the intervention group, the mean serum level of IL6 was reduced significantly (P = 0.039) post-intervention (2.19 ± 1.09 and 1.58 ± 1.06). No significant differences were seen in the mean levels of IL6, TNFα, TAC and CAL between two groups post-intervention.
Conclusions
It is suggested that daily consumption of resveratrol supplement may not change TNFα, TAC and CAL, but it would be beneficial in reducing serum levels of IL6. Therefore, further studies are suggested to investigate the effects of resveratrol supplementation along with NST on periodontal status."

However, the effect of both rotating and extended night shift work (12-hr rotating night) on MetS has not well-known. We aimed to examine and clarify the association among petrochemical workers.
Methods
We recruited 1575 eligible workers in this study. According to shift work schedules the participants were divided into following groups: 12-hr fixed day and 12-hr rotating night. Biochemical data, including fasting blood sugar and lipid panel (TC, TG, LDL, and HDL) were determined by blood tests. Demographic data was obtained by interview at the time of blood pressure and anthropometric indices measurements. The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) was applied to identify subjects with MetS. The Logistic regression models were used to predict risk of MetS and its components between study groups.
Results
The prevalence of MetS was showed 18.4% (290/1575). We found a significant difference between study groups in the prevalence of MetS (p < 0.05). The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in the 12-hr rotating night group in comparison to the 12-hr fixed day shift group according to unadjusted and full adjusted logistic regression models were estimated 1.26 (0.96, 1.65) and 1.34 (1.01, 1.76), respectively. Among MetS components, we observed the significant higher risk in TG and HDL (P < 0.05).
Conclusion
This study suggests 12-hr rotating night shift as the high-risk group for MetS. More studies needed to confirm our findings."

Cross-sectional study was conducted on T2DM adults of both sexes who attended the outpatient service of Al-Karak Teaching Hospital, Jordan during the period from June 2017 to August 2018. Participants were categorized in two groups according to their glycemic control and the presence of reno-vascular complications. Twenty healthy subjects were recruited as control group. Blood sample was obtained from all participants and used for the assessment of FBG, HbA1c, serum AGEs and sRAGE, serum urea and creatinine; 24 h urine was also collected for the determination of urinary albumin.
Results
Diabetic subjects with vascular complication had a significantly higher serum AGEs 50.3 ± 13 vs. 28.9 ± 8 pg/ml) and AGEs/sRAGE ratio (0.058 ± 0.02 vs. 0.037 ± 0.02) associated with significantly lower serum sRAGE (868.7 ± 50.8 vs. 912.8 ± 294.3) compared to those with no complications. Serum AGEs and sRAGE showed weak negative and non-significant association in both groups of patients. However, the AGEs/sRAGE ration was inversely and significantly associated with the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (r = − 0.51, P = 0.009) only in DM patients with reno-vascular complications.

abstract = "This study was carried out to specifically investigate the local HbA1C level and determine extent of (if any) variation from the WHO (World Health Organization) recommended threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes and prediabetes using blood glucose as a benchmark. In addition, we also looked to see what role BMI (Body Mass Index) plays among subjects used for the study. 152 subjects were used for the study: 101 diabetic subjects and 51 non-diabetic control subjects. 5 mL of blood sample was collected from each of the subjects after about 8–10 h of overnight fasting. 3–4 mL of the sample was centrifuged and the serum analysed for glucose. The remaining 1–2 ml was transferred into EDTA bottles and analysed immediately for glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C). The BMI (kg/m2) was calculated by dividing the weight in kilograms (kg) by the square of the height in metres (m2). For the BMI, no significant difference was observed between the diabetic subjects (mean = 25.75 kg/m2) and the non-diabetic control subjects (mean = 25.09 kg/m2). Thirty-seven (37) of the diabetic subjects and twenty-three (23) of the non-diabetic subjects had HbA1C levels (mean = 6.96% and 6.29% respectively) that would imply either prediabetes or diabetes but were actually normal going by their fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels. A new chart for the interconversions between FBG and HbA1c and for predicting their expected values from each other was realized, drawn up and recommended for consideration in the management of diabetic patients along with the WHO recommended chart. There are a lot of normal individuals with HbA1c level that does not conform to (or that are simply higher than) what is regarded as the threshold for the onset of diabetes or prediabetes. Generally, the local (Nigerian) glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level can therefore be said to be distinctly higher for a given blood glucose range and should be taken as such in the management of diabetes in this environment. Being overweight or obese is not prerequisite to the development of diabetes or abnormal glycated haemoglobin level."

abstract = "Background
The link between Vitamin-D deficiency and type 2 diabetes (T2D) is well-established. Since prediabetic obese populations have the greatest risk to develop to T2D, it was important in our study to examine serum 25(OH) D3 concentration among prediabetic obese patients and to evaluate the correlation between serum level of vitamin D and BMI, FBS, HOMA IR and HbA1c among prediabetes patients.
Methods
A multicenter case control study was carried out among 101 prediabetic persons & 50 controls, after obtaining consent from subjects and clearance from institutional ethics committee. Serum vitamin D level, Plasma levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting insulin levels were measured by ELISA in both groups enrolled in the study.
Results
The prevalence of vitamin-D deficiency/insufficiency was (73.3%) (n = 74) among 101 prediabetic obese individuals. Also, A significant inverse correlation was observed between vitamin D levels & body mass index(r = - 0.28, P = 0.004); fasting blood sugar (r = - 0.22, P = 0.002); HOMA insulin resistance (r = - 0.25 P = 0.01); HbA1C (r = - 0.2, P= 0.004).
Conclusions
High prevalence of vitamin D deficiency exists among obese prediabetic individuals and there is significant inverse correlation between BMI, FBS, HOMA IR, HbA1c and vitamin D level."

To determine beta cell reserves of patients with type 2 diabetes who are treated with insulin by using fasting C-peptide concentrations and to investigate the clinical features related to C-peptide concentrations.
Materials and methods
Patients with type 2 diabetes, who were using insulin as monotherapy or in combination therapy, were divided into three groups; those with an insufficient beta cell reserve (C-peptide: <0.5 ng/mL), borderline reserve (C-peptide: 0.5–2 ng/mL) and sufficient reserve (C-peptide:> 2 ng/mL).
Results
In the 249 patients (mean age, 61.77 ± 9.34 years; 40.6% male), the mean duration of diabetes was 13.9 ± 8.43 years. The mean HbA1c concentrations, fasting glucose and C-peptide concentrations were 8.88 ± 1.87%, 184.29 ± 77.88 mg/dL and 1.95 ± 1.37 ng/mL, respectively. Fifty-seven percent of patients (n = 142) had a borderline beta cell reserve and 37% (n = 92) had high C-peptide concentrations. Only 6% of patients (n = 15) had an insufficient beta cell reserve. C-peptide levels were positively correlated with waist circumference (r: 0.282; p = 0.001), hip circumference (r: 0.251; p = 0.001), body mass index (r: 0.279; p = 0.001), fasting glucose concentrations (r: 0.309; p = 0.001) and triglyceride concentrations (r: 0.358; p = 0.001).

Both screen time and metabolic syndrome (MetS) are associated with health outcomes. However, limited data exist on the association between screen time and MetS among expatriate adolescents living in United Arab Emirates (UAE).
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional school-based study on 473 expatriate adolescents (47% girls) aged 12–18 years in Al-Ain district of Abu Dhabi Emirates in the UAE. Data was collected with the expertise of trained nurses & IDF criteria was used to define MetS. Information on screen time (computer, television, and video game use combined) during a regular day was self-reported, and divided into two categories: <2, or ≥2 h per day. Using logistic regression analyses, adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for the association between screen time and MetS.
Results
A high proportion of adolescents (75.3%) spent ≥2 h daily on screen. The prevalence of MetS was 8.5% in those with <2 h per day of screen time compared with 13.5% in those who reported ≥2 h per day. There was a graded positive association between screen time and MetS (P-trend = 0.01). Each hour increase in screen time was associated with 21% (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.08–1.35) greater likelihood of having MetS. The adjusted OR value associated with ≥2 h of daily screen time was 2.20 (95% CI, 1.04–4.67), compared with adolescents who spent less than 2 h of daily screen time.
Conclusion
Higher screen time by expatriate adolescents was associated with increased likelihood of having MetS."

To identify mobile health applications with features for improving the lifestyle of patients with chronic diseases.
Methods
We performed a systematic literature review between November 2017 and May 2018 on the Virtual Health Library's interface. A total of 816 records were identified. In the selection process, 24 studies met inclusion criteria for analysis. Study characteristics were extracted and synthesized.
Results
We identified applications with similar functionalities, such as the use of reminders and medical monitoring. Most of them addressed the treatment of conditions related to an already diagnosed chronic disease, including Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, Cardiovascular Diseases, Asthma, Neoplasms, and chronic conditions in general. The main lifestyle changes were the reduction of body weight, promotion of healthy eating, and adherence to the regular practice of physical exercises.
Conclusions
Technology can facilitate health care with simple messages and alerts that aid in adherence to treatment. Changes in lifestyle with the use of applications are remarkable. Benefits may be even greater if more applications address the importance of prevention and not just treatment."

abstract = "Objective
It is usually difficult to clinically identify thyroid abnormalities in diabetics as features of thyroid dysfunction may simulate diabetes symptoms or complications. So, assessing thyroid dysfunction prevalence in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) would help better control of DM and its complications. Several studies reported this prevalence, however, some included small sample size or lacked a control group. We aimed to determine thyroid dysfunction prevalence in diabetic patients as well as its relation to glycemic control.
Methods
A cross-sectional study included 200 patients having type 2 DM and 200 apparently healthy controls. Each participant was tested for fasting and 2-h post-prandial blood glucose, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C), thyroid function tests: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free tri-iodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), serum total cholesterol and triglycerides and thyroid antibodies; anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) and anti-thyroglobulin (anti-Tg) for hypothyroidism only.
Results
There was a significant increase in serum TSH and T3 levels in diabetics when compared with the controls, (P < 0.001, P = 0.001), respectively. Thyroid dysfunction was significantly more prevalent in patients with HbA1c ≥ 8%, (P = 0.0001), and in those having longer diabetes duration, (P < 0.001).
Conclusion
There was a higher prevalence of thyroid dysfunction among patients with type 2 DM. This dysfunction increased with the rise of HbA1c. This could suggest that poor glycemic control may have a role in the development of thyroid dysfunction in type 2 DM patients. Subclinical hypothyroidism was the most prevalent type of thyroid dysfunction in diabetic patients."

Methodology
This was a cross-sectional, observational study conducted in a tertiary hospital and medical research centre of Karnataka, India in which males aged 35 years or more and suffering with T2DM for at-least 10years were enrolled. UI was assessed using International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire – Short Form (ICIQ-SF).
Results
Out of 123 male subjects having T2DM screened for the prevalence of UI, 19 subjects were diagnosed to be having UI as per ICIQ-SF questionnaire, accounting to 15.4% of the total sample. The mean ICIQ score of the 19 subjects having UI was 9.2 ± 1.54 showing that the mean severity of UI was moderate in nature. Study also found that the duration of diabetes was significantly high (mean = 18 ± 4.6 years) and glycemic control was significantly poor (Mean FBS = 210 ± 64.21 mg/dL) in subjects with UI than in subjects without UI.
Conclusions

The risks of hypoglycemia, dehydration and kidney injury may theoretically be aggravated by people with type 2 diabetes treated with Insulin and SGLT2 inhibitors during Ramadan. Data on safety and efficacy of SGLT2-I in people with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin is scanty. We aimed to assess the impact of SGLT2 inhibitors during Ramadan in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin, on hypoglycemia, glycemic control and kidney function.
Methods
This is a prospective interventional study on high-risk diabetes patients who insisted on fasting. All patients were treated with insulin ± SGLT2I. All patients received a FGMS and Ramadan focused education. All patients attended clinic before and post Ramadan where they were advised on treatment modification as well as biometric and biochemical measurements.
Results
95 patients enrolled in the study and 49 of them were on SGLT2i. There was a no significant change in creatinine in both groups. FGMS showed an improvement in the sensor-calculated HbA1c from 7.3 ± 1.5 to 6.8 ± 1.1 and from 8 ± 1.6 to 7.7 ± 1.5 in the SGLT2 group and the non-SGT2i groups, respectively. The hypoglycemia was predominantly reported during Ramadan between 12:00 to 18:00 h, while in pre-Ramadan readings was during 2400–0600 and 1200–1800 slots.
Conclusions
This is the first study that assesses the use of SGLT2i along with insulin during Ramadan, using FGMS in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes under optimal care. There was minimal interruption of fasting, significant improvement in glycemic control, and no significant change in the kidney function after Ramadan."

abstract = "Aim
The interest regarding the potential role of dairy products in the prevention of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has emerged. Although results remain mixed, numerous cohort studies have shown that increased dairy consumption is inversely associated with T2D risk. This narrative review evaluates the recent evidence of dairy products intake on T2D risk factors for the prevention of T2D.
Material and method
The review is framed within the systematic review and meta-analyses of cohort studies and the individual randomized controlled trials evidence. We searched for existing meta-analyses of cohort studies that addressed the association of dairy intake with incidence of T2D in adults using the MEDLINE (via PubMed) database. For the interventional studies, the literature searched was conducted using MEDLINE (via PubMed) with the following Medical Subjects Heading (MeSH) terms i.e. dairy OR milk OR cheese OR yogurt AND glucose OR diabetes OR insulin resistance OR insulin sensitivity OR pre-diabetes.
Results
Most of the meta-analyses and systematic reviews of the cohort studies point to a reduced risk of T2D with dairy intake of 3 servings per day. This effect was mainly attributed to low-fat dairy, particularly yogurt and cheese. However, there is no evidence in cohort studies that high-fat dairy intake poses any harm.
Conclusion
Dairy products, when incorporated into a healthy diet, likely do not have detrimental effects on glucose-related outcomes. The potential impact of dairy consumption on glucose tolerance tests, insulin levels, insulin sensitivity measures, and plasma glucose levels warrant future investigation."

abstract = "Objective
The effect of total antioxidant capacity on resting metabolic rate (RMR) and respiratory quotient (RQ) of overweight and obese woman has been debated globally. Total Antioxidant Capacity may have an independent effect on resting metabolic rate and respiratory quotient.
Methods and materials
A study population of 263 aged 18–50 years participated in this cross-sectional study from the communities of Tehran based on cluster sampling. Dietary intake assessed by using a semi quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) Demographic questions. Anthropometrics measurements for each participant were done. Dietary total antioxidant capacity (DTAC) was calculated by the 147-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and FRAP assay. Resting metabolic rate and respiratory quotient was measured by Indirect calorimetry.
Results
The mean DTAC of the study participants was 1251.8 (SD 893.60). There was a statistically significant relationship between dietary total antioxidant capacity (DTAC) and respiratory quotient (P > 0.013). People with high dietary total antioxidant capacity have tended to show a lower RQ than those with a lower one. There was a significant correlation between DTAC and RQ for both the adjusted model for age, total energy intake, BMI, physical activity, higher DTAC diet and the crude model which were (β = 0.011; SE = 0.005; CI = −0.021_0) and (β = −3.143E-6; SE = 0; CI = 0), respectively. However, we found no correlation between the DTAC and RMR/FFM-RES (P < 0.49). Also, a significantly higher relationship was demonstrated between dietary total antioxidant capacity and intake vegetables (P ≤ 0.006), fruits (P ≤ 0.009), white meet (P ≤ 0.03) and dairy products (P ≤ 0.005).
Conclusion
RQ is correlated with total antioxidant capacity. Increased intake of high DTAC foods may result in weight loss maintenance. This result may suggest a beneficial role of higher-DTAC diets in the prevention of obesity."

Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a complex disease. Interactions between genetic susceptible variants and environmental cues results in the development of this heterogenous disease. Having an understanding of the genetics of T2DM may lead to a better perspective and management of the pathogenesis contributing to T2DM.
Materials and methods
Published primary and secondary sources were reviewed covering the keywords “genetics + type 2 diabetes” using PubMed and Google Scholar as the main databases. Full articles were considered when the title and the abstract was found to be sufficiently related to the review's aim.
Results
Various genetic aspects of T2DM were summarised including a general understanding of the heritability and heterogeneity of T2DM. Furthermore, an explanation of the different genetic modalities that can be used to identify T2DM susceptible genes was provided.
Conclusion
In this day and era, researchers and healthcare professionals working in the field of metabolic disorders should have an understanding of T2DM genetics. The future lies in preventive and management action plans targeting the combination of genetics and environmental risk factors for a better health outcome."

Objective
To evaluate metabolic outcomes and quality of life (QoL) of children with T1DM trained in the use of the Freestyle Flash GM system adopting the ACDC guidelines.
Methods
Prospective study conducted at a single UK children's diabetes unit from 2017 to 2018.52 children with T1DM (age 5–18 yrs) were commenced on the Freestyle Flash GM system, received education and were followed up for 12 months. The Peds QL 3.2 diabetes questionnaire was used to assess QoL before and after the use of the system. HbA1c was measured at 3, 6 and 12 months pre and post use of Freestyle.
Results
52 children (33 M,19 F) with a mean age of 11.6 yrs (range 4 m–17.2 yrs) were evaluated. Mean HbA1c 3 months post Freestyle Flash GM showed a significant improvement when compared with HbA1c values at 12, 6 and 3 months pre Freestyle (p-value 0.040, 0.040, 0.012 respectively). This improvement was not sustained at 6 and 12 months (p-value 0.15, 0.50). The PedsQL3.2 diabetes scores demonstrated significant improvement in patient QoL, reduction of diabetes symptoms and treatment barriers following the use of the new technology (p-values 0.014; 0.018; 0.035 respectively).
Conclusions
Freestyle Flash GM technology associated with appropriate education and regular support by healthcare professionals improves patient quality of life measures in children with T1DM."

Various studies have evaluated the prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in patients with diabetes but few studies on prevalence of NAFLD in prediabetes have been performed so far. The present study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of NAFLD in prediabetics.
Material and methods
In this cross-sectional study, 100 diagnosed cases of Prediabetes were compared with 100 normoglycemic people after random selection from OPD for NAFLD by using various biochemical parameters and ultrasonography.
Results
Among 100 prediabetic cases, IFG was present in 28%, IGT in 26% and both were impaired in 46%. FPG, 2 Hour glucose post OGTT, diastolic blood pressure, weight, BMI, waist circumference, waist hip ratio, waist height ratio was significantly more in prediabetics as compared to controls. On USG, prevalence of NAFLD was more in prediabetics (59%) as compared to controls (26%) with p value =<0.001. Grade 1 fatty liver was present in 37% (n = 37) prediabetics as compare to 22% (n = 22) controls and Grade 2 fatty liver was present in 22% (n = 22) cases as compare to 4% (n = 4) controls with p value < 0.001. SGOT, SGPT, GGT, ALP, UA, TG were significantly higher in prediabetics as compared to controls. GGT and WC are best predictor of NAFLD in pre-diabetes with adjusted odd's ratio of 6.604 and 6.589 respectively.
Conclusion
To conclude with, prevalence of NAFLD is substantially more in prediabetic patients as compared to normoglycemic individuals and elevated WC and GGT were the best predictor of underlying NAFLD among prediabetic individuals."

abstract = "Aim
The global operation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has averted 30 million new infections and nearly 8 million deaths; however, it has an impact on metabolic syndrome (MS) acquisition. As a result, there is growing concern about MS; but strangely the magnitude of MS in HIV-infected cohort, and its differential contribution ART status in Ethiopia has yet to be abundantly studied. Hence, the aim of this study was to estimate and evaluate the difference of the overall magnitude of MS among ART exposed and ART naïve people living with HIV (PLWH).
Materials and methods
An institution based cross-sectional study was conducted at the randomly chosen two hospitals and health centers, in Gedio zone, southern Ethiopia between December 29th, 2017 and January 22nd, 2019. Data were collected using the WHO three step tools. The collected data were fed into Epidata version.3.1 and exported to SPSS version 22 for analysis. The descriptive complex sample analysis method was employed, and the prevalence and differences between groups were computed with a 95% CI.
Result
A total of 633 (n = 422 ART and n = 211 ART naive) PLWH was involved, with the response rate of 92.1%. Of whom, 22.0% (95% CI: 19.0–25.4) of PLWH had MS. It was slightly higher in the ART-exposed (22.5%, 95% CI: 18.7–26.8) than ART naïve (20.9%, 95% CI: 15.2–27.1) group.
Conclusion
The global magnitude of MS in the ART-exposed was relatively higher than ART naïve groups. This dictates the existence of HIV associated MS that necessitates immediate prevention and management strategies."

sustained virologic response (SVR) can be achieved in high percentage of HCV patients with the availability of direct acting antiviral agents DAAs. However, the effect of DAAs on insulin resistance and T2DM has yet to be clearly documented in spite of higher prevalence of T2DM in chronic HCV patients. This study tested the hypothesis that eradication of HCV is associated with either complete recovery or improvement of the symptoms of IR and T2DM.
Patients and methods
In our study 240 Chronic HCV patients candidate to centers of NCCVH with Coordination to departments of internal medicine and clinical pathology, Zagzig University for treatment with DAAs. Measurement of HbA1c, FPG and fasting insulin hormone and calculation of HOMA-IR before and 3 months after DDAs therapy is done. Statistical analysis was done for these data.
Results
After SVR; HbA1c decreased from 7.6 ± 0.69 to 6.7 ± 0.78 in diabetic group and from 5.8 ± 0.5 to 5.1 ± 0.3 in non-diabetic group, with decreased in the percentage of uncontrolled T2DM patients from 22.4% to 5.2% after treatment. HOMA-IR decreased in diabetic group from 4.9 ± 0.7 to 3.7 ± 0.75 and in non-diabetic group from 3.1 ± 0.56 to 2.3 ± 0.4 with complete improvement of IR to ≤2.5 in 20.7% of diabetic patients. 20% of diabetic patient needed to decrease oral hypoglycemic dose and 13.3% of them needed to decrease insulin dose.
Conclusions
This study shows that eradication of HCV by DAAs will result in a parallel decrease in IR and improve clinical outcomes in patients with established T2DM."

this study aimed to investigate stages of weight change in type 2 diabetics and its associations with diet knowledge and skills, diet decision making, diet and exercise barriers.
Materials and methods
This was a cross-sectional study of 1139 patients with type 2 diabetes aged>18 years in East Azerbaijan, Iran. Data were collected using the Personal Diabetes Questionnaire (PDQ) and were analyzed using SPSS software (version 22) and descriptive statistics, Chi-square and one-way ANOVA tests.
Results
48.1% of the patients were in the pre-contemplation stage. 7.5%, 14.6% and 29.8% of patients were in the stages of contemplation, preparation and action, respectively. Patients with a higher score in diet knowledge and skills and diet decision making were more likely to be involved in the action stage of weight loss process, while those who had more eating problems and exercise barriers were less likely to be involved in the action stage of weight loss.
Conclusion
The results of this study showed that a substantial percentage of patients are at the pre-contemplation stage, so proper measures are needed to inform patients about the consequences of obesity and overweight. It is also necessary to focus on people with poor incomes and education status and those living in rural areas. Improve diet knowledge and skills and diet decision making and the reduction of barriers to exercise can help patients to take action to lose weight."

Results
A predominant number (94.1%) knew what constitutes MS. However, merely more than a quarter of the participant (28%) knew correctly the serum LDL cutoff value for the diagnosis of MS according to IDF criteria. The aim of lipid lowering treatment was known by slightly more than three fourth (78%) of the participants. Two third also knew the target of antihypertensive therapy. More than two third (69.5%) were also aware that waist circumference is one of the criteria for diagnosis of Metabolic syndrome.
Conclusion
There is a need to increase the awareness of MS among the PHC Physicians. More training programs need to be planned. A better awareness among primary care physician is warranted for an early diagnosis and effective management of MS in Saudi Arabia."

CKD patients fail to increase insulin secretion in response to insulin resistance because of acidosis, 1,25 vitamin D deficiency, and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Hemodialysis causes further fluctuations in glycemic control due to alterations in insulin secretion, clearance and resistance. DKA is uncommon in hemodialysis patients because of the absence of glycosuria and osmotic diuresis which accounts for most of the fluid and electrolyte losses seen in DKA, anuric patients may be somewhat protected from dehydration and shock, although still subject to hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis. However, substantial volume loss can still occur due to a prolonged decrease in oral intake or increased insensible water losses related to tachypnoea and fever. There is no current guidelines for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis in anuric hemodialysis patients considering their differences than general population. In this review article we reviewed the literature and came with specific recommendations for management of Ketoacidosis in patients with CKD treated by hemodialysis."

abstract = "Background
Illness perceptions (IP) involve coping strategies and behavioural responses that can influence glycaemic control. Despite the importance of good glycaemic control, the majority of patients in Asia are not achieving glycaemic targets. An evaluation of IP in association with glycaemic control, medication adherence and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients (T2DM) was carried out in an outpatient setting in Malaysia
Method
A cross-sectional study was conducted using the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire in a purposive sample of 384 T2DM patients.
Results
There were 55.7% females, median age was 58.2 years and median duration of diabetes was 13 years. The majority (79.4%) of patients had poor diabetes control (HbA1c ≥ 7.0%) and 39.6% of patients had low medication adherence. Patients with good glycaemic control had a higher Timeline Acute/Chronic and Emotional Representations score, hence they held the correct belief that diabetes is chronic and experienced negative emotions. Highly adherent patients had a higher Illness Coherence (χ2 = 21.385, p < 0.001) score but a lower Consequences (χ2 = 17.592, p < 0.001) and Emotional Representations (χ2 = 16.849, p < 0.001) score indicating good understanding and less negative perceptions of disease burden. Patients in a more advanced stage of CKD had a significantly higher Timeline Cyclical score (χ2 = 18.718, p = 0.001), believing that diabetes was unpredictable.
Conclusion
Dimensions of IP have been shown to be significantly associated with the assessed variables, therefore intervention studies with education, support and counselling should be conducted in Asia with the ultimate aim of empowering patients through IP-targeted management."

Simple surrogate indices of insulin sensitivity have been conceived to deal with costly and complicated approaches, such as the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp; however, their use has not been widespread given their variabilities in different populations. In this paper, we present two simple surrogate indices, one that uses fasting glucose and insulin values and the other based on the values from the oral glucose tolerance test.
Materials and methods
The proposed methods integrate easy-to-obtain anthropometric measures. Evolutionary algorithms were used to optimize the proposed methods by maximizing its correlation with the Stumvoll MCR method.
Results and conclusion
When the proposed indices were applied to three study groups (control subjects, metabolic syndrome, marathon runners), a reduction in the intergroup variability of the insulin sensitivity was obtained. Moreover, the proposed index based on the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which considers the glucose metabolism process and the hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity, showed stronger correlations with the Stumvoll method and lower intergroup variability than the fasting one."

abstract = "Background and objective
Although obesity is a heterogeneous disease, little is known regarding chronic medical conditions (CMCs) that defines variability in obese populations. The characterization of obese populations using CMCs rather than categorization using BMI alone can advance understanding of obesity. The aims of this study are to phenotype obesity in a large representative sample of non-Hispanic White (NHW), non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and Mexican American (MA) obese adults using CMCs, and assess relationship between resulting phenotypes and self-rated health (SRH).
Methods
Sex-specific two-step cluster analysis was used to phenotype obese participants (n = 12,547) to CMC-based clusters. The prevalence of CMCs and lifestyle risk factors in each cluster was assessed. Sex and race/ethnic specific association between cluster membership and SRH was determined using odds ratio (OR) from logistic regression analysis.
Results
Distinct subgroups of obese men and women were observed: moderate dyslipidemic healthy young obese men, hypertensive-dyslipidemic middle-age obese men, hypertensive young obese men, hypertensive-dyslipidemic-asthmatic middle-age obese men, and syndemic elderly obese men, healthy young obese women, hypertensive-dyslipidemic middle-age obese women, dyslipidemic young adult obese women, syndemic middle-age obese women, and syndemic elderly obese women. Participants in the more CMCs symptomatic clusters reported high rates of behavioral risk factors and showed significantly greater odds of poor SRH than participants in the less symptomatic clusters. Compared to obese persons who are asymptomatic for CMCs, syndemic elderly obese and women men had much higher increased ORs for poor SRH with values of 3.88 [95% CI = 2.41–6.26], 3.96 [95% CI = 1.86–8.30] and 7.25 [95% CI = 2.41–9.6] for NHW, NHB and MA men, respectively. The corresponding ORs for women are 4.08 [95% CI = 2.71–6.14], 4.01 [95% CI = 2.40–6.69], and 2.62 [95% CI = 1.32–5.19], respectively.
Conclusion
Obesity treatment and intervention should consider heterogeneity within obese persons and pay greater attention to obesity related co-morbidities and metabolic manifestations."

Although there were data received in clinical studies, which confirmed a causative role of altered function of FGF-23/Klotho protein axis in manifestation of CV disease in prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the target therapy of these diseases directing on improvement of metabolic profiles, systemic and adipokine-relating inflammation by beneficial restoring of dysregulation in FGF-23/Klotho protein axis remain to be not fully clear. The aim of the review was to summarize findings regarding the role of impaired FGF-23/Klotho protein axis in developing CV complications in patients with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus. It has been elucidated that elevated levels of FGF-23 and deficiency of Klotho protein in peripheral blood are predictors of CV disease and CV outcomes in patients with (pre) diabetes, while predictive values of dynamic changes of the concentrations of these biomarkers require to be elucidated in detail in the future."

The costs of treatment of diabetes exists among the patients of all socioeconomic groups.A recent study showed that, in India, the total annual expenditure by patients on diabetes care was, on average, Rs. 10,000 in urban areas and Rs. 6260 in rural areas. The studies related to diabetes indicate that the direct and indirect cost implications of diabetes are multifold worldwide. The direct costs are related to the medical and non-medical cost of people with diabetes, mostly the burden on individual and at the family level. The indirect costs are related to the society and government, which are associated to loss of productivity. The review also finds that the annual direct and indirect medical costs per patient increase with the number of microvascular and macrovascular complications. A study in India during the years 2008 and 2009 found that total costs for patients without complications were Rs. 4493 compared to Rs. 14,692for patients with complications.The review reveals that it is imperative to work effectively towards implementing a holistic programme for diabetes prevention and reduce diabetic expenditure burden in the community."

Retrospective cohort study under real life conditions. Baseline and one-year follow-up variables of glycemic control, hypoglycemia and glycemic variability were compared.
Results
Fifty patients were included, 31 on prior treatment with SAPT with low-glucose suspend (LGS) feature and 19 on multiple dose insulin injections (MDI). Mean HbA1c decreased in the MDI group (8.24%–7.08%; p = 0.0001). HbA1c change was not significant in the SAPT-LGS group. Area under the curve (AUC) below 70 mg/dl improved in both SAPT-LGS and MDI groups while AUC, %time and events below 54 mg/dl decreased in SAPT-LGS group. Glycemic variability improved in the MDI group. Less patients presented severe hypoglycemia with SAPT-PLGM in both groups, however the change was non-significant.
Conclusions
Under real life conditions, SAPT-PLGM reduced metrics of hypoglycemia in patients previously treaded with MDI and SAPT-LGS without deteriorating glycemic control in SAPT-LGS patients, while improving it in patients treated with MDI."

Podocyte injury and subsequent excretion in urine play a crucial role in the pathogenesis and progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Quantification of messenger RNA expression in urinary sediment by real-time PCR is emerging as a noninvasive method of screening DN-associated biomarkers. We aimed to study the expression of podocyte-associated genes in urinary sediment and their relation to disease severity in type 2 diabetic Egyptian patients with diabetic nephropathy.
Method
ology: Sixty patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were recruited in addition to twenty non diabetic healthy volunteers. Relative mRNA abundance of nephrin, podocalyxin, and podocin were quantified, and correlations between target mRNAs and clinical parameters were examined.
Results
The urinary mRNA levels of all genes studied were significantly higher in diabetics compared with controls (p < 0.001), and mRNA levels increased with DN progression. Urinary mRNA levels of all target genes positively correlated with both UAE and HbA1c. The expression of nephrin, podocalyxin, and podocin mRNA correlated with serum creatinine {(r = 0.397, p value = 0.002), (r = 0.431, p value = 0.001), (r = 0.433, p value = 0.001) respectively}.
Conclusion
The urinary mRNA profiles of nephrin, podocalyxin, and podocin were found to increase with the progression of DN, which suggested that quantification of podocyte-associated molecules will be useful biomarkers of DN."

The objectives of this study were to assess the profile of lifestyle habits among children exposed (GDM+) or unexposed (GDM-) to GDM and to assess whether a healthy lifestyle profile is associated with lower adiposity values among these children.
Methods
A total of 105 GDM+ and 38 GDM- children aged 2–14 years were included. Vegetables and fruit intakes were collected using two 24-h dietary recalls. Physical activity and sedentary time were measured with accelerometers. Screen and sleep time were assessed using questionnaires. Weight, height and waist circumference were measured. Body composition was assessed by absorptiometry.
Results
GDM+ children had lower moderate-to-vigorous physical activity practice (p = 0.043) and fruit intake (p = 0.020) than GDM- children. Among children with an unhealthy lifestyle (meeting 0–2 lifestyle recommendations), GDM+ children had greater percentage of fat mass (p = 0.021) and android fat mass (p = 0.020) than GDM- children. Moreover, among GDM+ children, children with a healthy lifestyle (meeting 3–4 lifestyle recommendations) tended to have lower percentage of fat mass (p = 0.053) and android fat mass (p = 0.071) than those with an unhealthy lifestyle.
Conclusion
Improving lifestyle habits among GDM+ children could represent a promising approach to prevent deteriorated adiposity values."

Results
A total of (n = 22) publications comprising sixteen peer-reviewed studies and six professional-organisations (grey literature) were selected for review, as they listed the core competencies of DEs. The most common core competencies were related to knowledge and skills in diabetes self-management education, knowledge of pathophysiology and epidemiology, teaching skills, clinical skills and cultural competency. Evidently, an appropriate tool for assessing DEs’ competencies is currently unavailable.

abstract = "Introduction
Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is a peptide that shares sequence homology with insulin and has endocrine, paracrine and autocrine functions, acts on endothelial cells, and stimulates angiogenesis. IGF1 also affects renal hemodynamics both directly and indirectly by interacting with the renin-angiotensin system.
Objective
The study aimed at detecting a relation between age-adjusted IGF1 (AAIGF1) and cardiovascular risk score in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease.
Design
Patients were 90 females and 42 males with different stages of CKD ranging from 0 to 4. After taking a consent, serum IGF1 was recorded and adjusted for the age of the patient using the IGF1 score equation: {[(log IGF-1 + 0.00625xage)-2.555]/0.104}. Both univariate and multivariate regression analyses of AAIGF1 to different metabolic parameters and microvascular complications of type 2 DM were done. A ROC curve for CV risk score was issued.
Results
AAIGF1 showed a significant bidirectional change with the stage of CKD. Univariate analysis was done including cardiovascular parameters in relations to AAIGF1. A significant positive correlation was found between AAIGF1 and CV risk score (B = 0.036, p = 0.003), SBP (B = 0.030, P = 0.004) and DBP (B = 0.071, P = 0.000), with a reciprocal relation to EF (B = -0.050, P = 0.016). Multivariate regression showed a significant correlation between AAIGF1 and age, HOMAIR, HOMAB, Uric acid. A ROC curve with AUC of 0.675, P = 0.003, showed that AAIGF1 of approximately −1.7 is a cut off for intermediate CV risk (10 year risk score >7.5%).
Conclusion
AAIGF1 shows a bidirectional relation to the grade of chronic kidney disease in adults with type 2 DM. A cut off point for AAIGF1 was set to indicate intermediate CV risk score, which can encourage using AAIGF1 as a prognostic marker for higher CV risk score. Medications that modulate IGF1 level can affect CV risk."

Diabetes mellitus is a common chronic disease with increasing prevalence world wide; it leads to devastating human, social and economic impact.
Aims
this study were to determine the level of diabetes-related knowledge, attitude, and practice among adult diabetic patients in central region and finding correlation between knowledge, attitude and practice regarding diabetes.
Method
A descriptive study was conducted on 300 diabetic patients on internet using Monkey Survey from 7th to 24th April 2015. A questionnaire was filled out. SPSS version 22 was used for data analysis. Descriptive statistics were comprising percentages, and frequency in order to describe knowledge, attitude, and practice. Correlations between main outcomes variables were calculated by means of Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (r) that measures the linear relationship between two variables. P-value ≤0.05 were regarded as statistically significant.
Results
In the studied sample, 47% were age more than 45 years. About 71.4% of cases were females. The level of knowledge and attitude had ‘good’ in 73.6%, and 87.7% respectively but level of practice had poor in 45% of patients. There were good correlations between knowledge, attitude and practice. Significant positive linear correlation between knowledge and attitude (r = 0.503, P < 0.001), knowledge and practice (r = 0.337, P < 0.001), and statistically significant linear correlation between attitude and practice (r = 0.235, P < 0.001).

Recent studies demonstrate that complications of diabetes i.e. microvascular and macrovascular complications may manifest in some prediabetic subjects. This article reviews prediabetes-related risk factors and health issues. In addition, this article also highlights the interventions to prevent the development of diabetes in prediabetic subjects."

The study examined the prevalence of underweight and overweight or obesity and its correlates among in-school adolescents in five ASEAN countries (Indonesia, Laos, Philippines, Thailand and Timor-Leste) in 2015.
Methods
Cross-sectional data were analysed from 30145 school-going adolescents (median age 14 years, interquartile range = 2) from Indonesia, Laos, Philippines, Thailand and Timor-Leste that took part in the “Global School-Based Student Health Survey (GSHS)” in 2015. Body weight was examined by self-reported weight and height and the “international child body mass index standards”. Associations with underweight and overweight or obesity were assessed using multinomial logistic regression analyses.
Results
The prevalence of underweight was 8.7% and overweight or obesity 14.0%. In adjusted multinomial logistic regression analysis, students residing in Timor-Leste, older age, male sex, bullying victimization and parental supervision were positively associated with underweight, while residing in Laos, current alcohol use and peer support were negatively associated with underweight. Coming from the Philippines and Timor-Leste, older age, experiencing hunger, current alcohol use, and in a physical fight decreased the odds for overweight or obesity, while male sex, fruit consumption, sedentary behaviour, physically attacked and parental bonding increased the odds for overweight or obesity.
Conclusion
High prevalences of underweight and overweight/obesity were identified in ASEAN countries and several correlates were identified which can help to tailor interventions."

The present study analysed the regular salt and macronutrients consumption of South Indian population with diabetes, hypertension and renal dysfunction.
Methods
The cross sectional study was performed among 200 subjects, divided into four different groups consisted of control, subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) without any other complications, T2DM subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and T2DM subjects with hypertension (HTN). The dietary salt intake was estimated from 24-h urinary sodium excretion and the amount of macronutrients was calculated using 24-h dietary recall method.
Results
Out of 200 study subjects, only 28 (14%) were consuming salt as per the recommended levels by WHO (i.e., 5–6 g/day). Thirty-eight (19%) subjects were consuming more than 18 g of salt per day, 67 (33.5%) were consuming 12–18 g of salt per day and another 67 (33.5%) were found to be consuming salt in a range of 6–12 g/day. Calorie contribution from the carbohydrates was significantly high compared to the calories from the proteins. Fat consumption and its corresponding energy contribution were also high among HTN group subjects.
Conclusion
Observations of the study point out to the requirement of nationwide intensive and persistent efforts to enhance the public awareness on salt reduction."

A large percentage of gestational diabetes (GDM) are undiagnosed, and prevalence of postpartum type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is unknown, especially in developing countries. This study assessed barriers to GDM diagnosis and postpartum follow-up; to determine educational needs.
Materials and methods
This was a clinical observational study of records and procedures of antenatal services at two hospitals. Laboratory and medical records were reviewed for availability of data on anthropometrics, blood glucose, gestational age, urinalysis, and lipid profile for GDM register. Antenatal clinic protocol was observed for GDM diagnosis. BMI was derived and data were analyzed using SPSS version 20.
Results
Critical barriers attributable to health systems included lack of screening for blood sugar as part of routine antenatal protocol, and lack of GDM registers at both facilities. There was 6.5% registration of pregnancies in first trimester, 22% pre-pregnancy obesity, and 2.6% high blood pressure. Positive glucosuria cases were not followed-up for GDM diagnosis.
Conclusions
There is neither concerted effort to diagnose GDM, nor systematic records of screening and postpartum follow-up. The gap in diabetology knowledge and practice calls for re-training of antenatal healthcare professionals. GDM screening checklist needs to be established and positive results entered into GDM registers for proper management during and after delivery."

We aimed to investigate CTRP12, CTRP13, and inflammatory gene expressions in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from obese women who underwent bariatric surgery in comparison with the normal weight women. This case-control study included 20 obese [body mass index (BMI) > 35–40 kg/m2] candidates for bariatric surgery and 20 normal-weight women (BMI <25 kg/m2) as control group, who underwent elective surgeries. Real-time PCR was used to evaluate mRNA expression levels of CTRP12, CTRP13, and inflammatory genes in SAT and VAT from both groups. We observed significantly higher mRNA expression of CTRP12 in SAT (p = 0.048) and VAT (p = 0.046) from obese patients compared to the controls. There was significantly greater expression of IL-6 and MCP-1 inflammatory genes in SAT (p = 0.013 and p = 0.005 respectively) and VAT (p = 0.000 and p = 0.001 respectively) of obese patients compared to the control group. IL-1β (p = 0.015) and TNF-α (p = 0.014) expressions significantly increased in VAT from obese patients compared to the control group. Spearman correlation analysis showed that CTRP12 expression significantly correlated with obesity indices. Our findings showed that CTRP12 significantly increased in both VAT and SAT of obese group. More importantly, we observed a positive correlation between CTRP12 with inflammatory parameters. These results indicated that CTRP12 might be part of an intricate network for glucose metabolism and obesity-related inflammation processes."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of an inpatient diabetes care education during the first year of internal medicine residency training on inpatient glycemic control.
Methods
The program was comprised of 1-hr small group teaching per 4-week rotation and twice-a-week morning insulin round by an endocrinologist. Inpatient insulin management guideline leaflet was provided to all internal medicine residents. We retrospectively collected the point-of-care testing for glucose (POCT-glu) data in patients admitted to the general medicine wards and compared the mean of blood glucose (BG) before and after the education program. A total of 134438 POCT-glu values from 7055 patients were analyzed.
Results
After the initiation of the education program, mean BG levels significantly decreased during the first year and were lowest during the second year after education (Mean BG at baseline was 161.38 ± 64.10 mg/dL; 1st year, 159.48 ± 62.53 mg/dL and 2nd year, 155.60 ± 64.94 mg/dL, p-value < 0.0001). The reduction of BG levels was more pronounced in the patients with previously undiagnosed diabetes mellitus than patients with underlying diabetes mellitus. The rates of severe hypoglycemia (defined by BG < 40 mg/dL or 2.2 mmol/L) were not significantly different before and after education (baseline 0.12%, 1st year 0.14%, and 2nd year 0.14%, p-value = 0.632).
Conclusions
Lack of confidence and inadequate knowledge of insulin treatment in physicians were important barriers to glycemic management. Consistent education in internal medicine residents led to a significant improvement in inpatient glycemic control."

Methods
A cross sectional study included 100 patients with type 2 DM ≥ 18 y of both genders who were randomly selected from the medical units of Baghdad Teaching Hospital. After taking verbal consents; MPV was measured&correlated with aimed variables. Diabetics with HbA1c ≤ 7% were considered as having adequate control while those with (HbA1c) > 7% as having poor control. Albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) in urine was measured and classified into normal, moderately and severely increased. Odds ratios with 95% CI were calculated and P ≤ 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
Results
The mean MPV was 7.7 fl ± 1.2. Regarding ACR, 42% had normal level, 37% with moderately increased and 21% had severely increased level. Regarding HbA1c, 68% were having poorly controlled DM. Mean platelets’ count and MPV were higher in the uncontrolled group with a statistically significant association. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between MPV and albuminuria, duration of DM, HTN, IHD, Stroke, BMI, HbA1c, and platelets count.

Tukey's HSD post hoc tests were applied to illustrate ANOVA findings.
Results
59.3% of patients do not follow a diet plan to control their blood glucose. 44.7%, 5.5%, 13%, and 36.8% of patients, respectively, were in the stages of pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation and action. Patients who had shorter disease duration and those whose current treatment was lifestyle change were more likely within the action stage. Also, patients who had a higher score in diet knowledge and skills and diet decision making and those who had a lower score in diet barriers were more likely in the action stage of change.
Conclusion
Based on the results of this study, a considerable proportion of diabetic patients were in the pre-contemplation stage. Diet knowledge and skills, diet decision making and diet barriers were factors contributing to diet readiness to change. Therefore, taking necessary measures to increase diet knowledge, skills and diet decision-making and a reduction in diet barriers can help people with type 2 diabetes to change diet."

Blood analyses of lipid and glycemic profiles were carried out, and the gene expression was assessed by RT-qPCR. The systemic expression of IL6, TNFA and LEP genes were significantly higher in T2D, dyslipidemia and PD patients, while the PECAM1 gene showed the opposite. Higher RETN levels were found in patients with T2D independently of their glycemic control status. There were positive correlations between: TNFA, LEP and RETN with worse periodontal parameters; IL6, TNFA, ADIPOR1, LEP and RETN with waist-to-hip ratio; glycemic parameters with RETN; total cholesterol and triglycerides with LEP expression. We conclude that pro-inflammatory cytokines were related with worse lipid, glycemic and periodontal parameters, reinforcing that a hyper-inflammatory status connects systemic and oral inflammatory diseases."

The association of individuals’ anthropometric indices with their development of metabolic syndrome (MetS) has been investigated in several studies. Taking into account the ethnic differences, this study aimed to determine the most appropriate cut-off points of anthropometric indices in predicting the incidence of MetS and its components in Ahvaz.
Methods
This study is part of a cohort study conducted at the Diabetes Research Center of Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences on a population of over 20 in Ahvaz during 2009–2014. Of the 592 patients, 505 patients who were not diagnosed with MetS in 2009, were entered into this study. The data analyzed involved demographic information including age and sex, anthropometric information including height, weight, waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC) and the ratios between them, laboratory data including blood levels of Triglyceride (TG), Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and clinical data including systolic(S) and diastolic(D)blood pressure(BP). After 5 years, the subjects were re-evaluated for MetS based on the National Cholesterol Education Program – Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) criteria and the most appropriate cut-off points of anthropometric indices for the prediction of the incidence of MetS using the Receiver Operative Characteristic (ROC) curves were obtained.
Results
Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR) index with a cut-off point of 0.53 followed by WC with a cut-off point of 87.5 cm had the highest power to predict the incidence of MetS. The cut-off points of WC and Body mass index (BMI) were respectively 89.5 cm and 26 kg/m2 for men, and 83.5 cm and 27.5 kg/m2 for women. All anthropometric indices were able to predict the components of this syndrome (with the exception of low HDL-C). The cut-off point of WC in predicting High FBS, High TG and High BP was 84.5, 84.8, and 86.5 cm, respectively.
Conclusion
Overall, it seems that given its ease of measurement, the WC index is preferred to other indices for predicting the incidence of MetS and its components in clinical screening."

To assess serum vitamin D status and its relations to other biochemical parameters in type 2 diabetic patients from Gaza Strip.
Materials and methods
This case-control study included 58 type 2 diabetic patients as well as 58 non-diabetic controls. Patients and controls were matched for age and gender. Data were obtained from questionnaire interview, and biochemical analysis of blood samples.
Results
Serum vitamin D was significantly lower in diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic controls (25.9 ± 11.0 versus 34.6 ± 13.8 ng/dl, % difference = 28.8%, P < 0.001). The number of patients having vitamin D deficient, insufficient and sufficient were 6 (10.4%), 35 (60.3%) and 17 (29.3%) compared to controls of 3 (5.2%), 16 (27.6%) and 39 (67.2%), respectively (χ2 = 14.672, P < 0.001). Serum glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and triglycerides were significantly higher in patients than in controls whereas serum insulin, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and calcium were significantly lower in patients. Serum vitamin D showed significant negative correlations with HbA1c (r = − 0.186, P = 0.046), ALT (r = − 192, P = 0.040) and AST (r = − 0.188, P = 0.044) whereas significant positive correlations were found with HDL-C (r = 0.188, P = 0.044) and calcium (r = 0.239, P = 0.010).
Conclusion
The significant negative and positive correlations of vitamin D with HbA1c and calcium, respectively suggests that vitamin D supplementation would be of potential therapeutic value in clinical settings for controlling of type 2 diabetes and more importantly its complications. However, a well-designed clinical trials are needed to define the contribution of vitamin D status and therapy in the global diabetes problem."

Here, we hypothesized that biochemical analyses of blood serum in pregnant women with GDM will develop an insight on the pathogenesis of the disease and possibly uncover new biomarkers. In order to test our hypothesis, antenatal pregnant women (n = 300) were selected for blood samples including 176 with positive clinical/family history and 124 with negative clinical/family history of GDM during the early second trimester (14–18 weeks of gestation). All the subjects were followed up to the early third trimester (24–28 weeks of gestation) for second sampling until the onset of GDM. Lipid profile data shows that mean values of triglycerides, total cholesterol, low density lipids and very low density lipids were significantly higher (p < 0.05) and mean HDL was significantly lower in early second trimester in those patients who subsequently developed GDM during late third trimester when compared with those who didn't develop GDM. Inflammatory biomarker such as High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels were also found to be significantly higher by 69% increase in patients who developed GDM later in third trimester in comparison with those who didn't develop. About 32% patients who finally developed GDM belonged to positive clinical/family history group. The results of our study indicate that abnormal serum cholesterol; triglycerides, HDL, LDL, VLDL and hs-CRP play a vital in pathophysiology of gestational diabetes. Early diagnosis of GDM based on these biochemical markers will help decrease adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes."

This study evaluated the activity of xanthine oxidase in Nigerians with type 2 diabetic mellitus as well as its relationship with lipid peroxidation, inflammatory bio markers and glycemic control indices.
Methods
Two hundred and thirty seven (237) subjects, comprising of one hundred and fifty seven (157) DM subjects and eighty (80) aged matched controls participated in this study. Blood samples were collected from the participants for the estimations of xanthine oxidase activity, uric acid, malon diadehyde (MDA), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), high sensitive c – reactive protein (hs CRP), glucose, fructosamine and glycosylated hemoglobin by standard methods.
Results
The results of this study showed a significantly increased activity of xanthine oxidase in DM (0.044 ± 0.05μ/mg) compared with apparently healthy controls (0.028 ± 0.00 μ/mg). The mean plasma levels of MDA (42.40 ± 2.50μmol/l) and uric acid (7.22 ± 0.20 mg/dl) in DM were significantly higher (p ≤ 0.05) than healthy non DM group. The mean levels of hs CRP in DM (4.09 ± 0.91μg/ml) was significantly higher than controls (1.30 ± 0.50μg/ml, p = 0.009). While no association of xanthine oxidase was observed with glycemic control indices and hs CRP, a negative association of xanthine oxidase was observed with MDA (r = −0.514, p = 0.000).
Conclusion
Increased activity of xanthine oxidase in DM was associated with increased lipid peroxidation and could be a salient entity towards the onset on complications."

Recent epidemiological data have suggested that the prevalence of obesity is at an all-time high, growing to be one of the world's biggest problems. There are several mechanisms on how individuals develop obesity which includes genetic and environmental factors. Not only does obesity contribute to other health issues but it also greatly affects the quality of life, physical ability, mental strength and imposes a huge burden in terms of healthcare costs. Along with that, obesity is associated with the risk of mortality and has been shown to reduce the median survival rate. Obesity is basically when the body is not able to balance energy intake and output. When energy intake exceeds energy expenditure, excess calories will be stored as fat leading to weight gain and eventually obesity. The therapeutic market for treating obesity is composed of many different interventions from lifestyle intervention, surgical procedures to pharmacotherapeutic approaches. All of these interventions have their respective benefits and disadvantages and are specifically prescribed to a patient based on the severity of their obesity as well as the existence of other health conditions. This review discusses the genetic and environmental causes of obesity along with the recent developments in anti-obesity therapies."

abstract = "Aim
To assess the association between elevated waist circumference (WC) and high waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) with insulin resistance biomarkers.
Methods
We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study in normal-weight adults. Participants were divided in two groups according to WC or WHtR levels. We considered values of WC ≥ 90 in male participants and WC ≥ 80 in adult women as elevated, and values of WHtR≥0.50 as high, for both genders. Our outcomes were high triglycerides to HDL-cholesterol (TG/HDL-C) ratio and elevated triglycerides and glucose index (TGI). We considered values of TG/HDL-C ratio ≥ 3 as high and TGI values ≥ 8.37 as elevated. We elaborated crude and adjusted Poisson generalized linear models to evaluate the proposed associations and explored the gender interaction using stratified models. We reported the prevalence ratio (PR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).
Results
We analyzed 355 participants. The prevalence of elevated WC and high WHtR was 17.2% (n = 61) and 33.2% (n = 118), respectively, while the prevalence of high TG/HDL-C ratio and elevated TGI was 24.8% (n = 88) and 12.7% (n = 45), respectively. In the adjusted regression model, elevated WC was associated with high TG/HDL-C ratio only in female participants (aPR = 3.61; 95%CI: 1.59–8.20). Similarly, high WHtR was associated with high TG/HDL-C ratio in women (aPR = 2.54; 95%CI:1.08–5.97). We found an association with statistically marginal significance between elevated WC and elevated TGI in women (aPR = 1.54; 95%CI: 0.95–2.50); as well as for the association between high WHtR and elevated TGI in male participants (aPR = 1.87; 95%CI: 1.00–3.50).
Conclusion
Elevated WC and high WHtR were associated with a high TG/HDL-C ratio in women. It is necessary to perform prospective follow-up studies in the Peruvian population in order to corroborate our results."

Physicians need to play a proactive role to combat obesity and its associated comorbidities. The present survey was conducted to assess the awareness, knowledge, practice and attitude of the physicians in Bangladesh in the prevention and management of obesity.
Methods
Three hundred physicians were randomly selected from a medical university, a government medical college and a private medical college in Bangladesh to be included in this survey. All of them voluntarily participated in the survey upon the assurance of anonymity. All the selected physicians were provided with a questionnaire consisting of nine questions for assessing their awareness, knowledge, practice and attitude regarding obesity.
Results
Out of 300 participants, about 77% claimed that they know their own BMI and BMI cut-off points for overweight and obesity. But 38% physicians were unable to write the cut-off points correctly. Near about 50% physicians claimed that they know the BMI cut-off points for Asian population. However, only 7% were able to correctly write the BMI cut-off points for Asian population. About 47% physicians agreed that they do not calculate BMI or evaluate other measures of body fatness during clinical practice. However, 99% of the physicians considered that measuring BMI during consultation or clinical practice is important.
Conclusions
It may be concluded that Bangladeshi physicians’ have positive attitude for managing obesity but their practice is grossly inadequate. Most importantly, knowledge and awareness of the physicians about diagnosis of obesity is very poor."

Life threatening macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes can be minimized by effective glycaemic control. Self monitoring of blood glucose with glucometers is recognized as a cost effective strategy to improve glycaemic control. However accuracy and precision of glucometers will determine the effectiveness of this strategy. We aimed to evaluate accuracy and precision of commonly used glucometers in Sri Lanka.
Materials and methods
An observational study was conducted in a tertiary care setting including patients with diabetes and healthy volunteers. Eight commonly used glucometers were used. Blood glucose was measured in 50 participants (16 healthy volunteers, 34 patients with diabetes) in finger prick capillary blood using glucometers and venous blood using standard laboratory methods, and were compared to determine accuracy. Repeated measurements from same glucometer with a single finger prick were made and compared to determine precision.
Results
Only one glucometer showed insignificant difference to venous plasma glucose values. Only one glucometer met ADA recommended bias of <5%. None of the glucometers fell within the ISO recommendations for accuracy.
Conclusion
Majority of commonly used glucometers in Sri Lanka do not meet the ADA recommendations and ISO standards for accuracy and precision. However their variations are unlikely to make significant adverse impact on patient management."

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a composite heterogeneous condition with multifactorial etiology like genetic, environmental factors and oxidative stress. The exact pro-oxidant and antioxidant status in PCOS patients has not yet been fully established. We designed prospective study aimed to explore the association of PCOS and oxidative stress and examine the relationship of oxidative stress biomarkers with insulin parameters.
Methods
Two groups were included: study group including 85 women with PCOS and control group of 85 healthy volunteers. Biochemical, Hormonal and insulin parameters were measured. Vitamin C, vitamin E, nitric oxide and activities of antioxidant enzymes were estimated using spectrophotometric methods.
Results
Subjects with PCOS had poor antioxidant status as reflected by significantly low levels of glutathione, vitamin C & E and considerably increased activities of antioxidant enzymes like glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glutathione transferase as compared to those without PCOS. At the same time insulin levels were found to be significantly high and a positive correlation between oxidative stress and insulin parameters was observed in PCOS.
Conclusion
Low levels of antioxidants and increased oxidative stress with insulin resistance along with the observed correlation between these parameters suggest that women with PCOS are under oxidative stress which supports the concept that oxidative stress is involved in PCOS pathophysiology. Thus oxidative stress could be a contributory factor to future cardiovascular disease risk in these women in addition to known features like dyslipidemia, central obesity, etc."

out of the 300 diabetes patients recruited 42% of patients with type 2 diabetes had abnormal Creatinine Serum levels and 22.3% had abnormal glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Abnormal albumin urine levels were found in 28.3% and 11.3% had abnormal creatinine in urine. Abnormal Albumin: Creatinine Ratios (Alb/Cr), were found in 23%. Of the total, 77% (n = 231) had normal Alb: Cr Ratio, 20% had risk of nephropathy and 9% had nephropathy.
Conclusion
Current study revealed a high prevalence of abnormal renal parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes Mellitus. This necessitates the need for early and universal screening of renal functions. There is also an urgent demand for measures that target tight glycaemic, Vitamin D level and life style modifications is also required to all diabetic patients to achieve target value of HbA1C ≤ 7."

Insulin resistance (IR) in cases of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is connected to remarkable liver cell inflammation and cardiovascular complications. Given the prevalence of NAFLD and its association with potential sequels, there is a strong need for an accurate non-invasive tool to monitor the progression of NAFLD.
Methods
272 patients with NAFLD and cardio-metabolic risk factors were tested for HOMA-IR, mean platelet volume (MPV), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), uric acid, ferritin, lipid profile, liver stiffness measurement (LSM), controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) by fibroscan and carotid intima media thickness (CIMT). Liver biopsy was performed to validate the results.100 healthy controls were selected. A score was constructed and applied to a validation group (n = 61).
Results
Logistic regression revealed that significant fibrosis and cardiovascular risk in NAFLD were independently associated with AST/ALT ratio (p = 0.000), GGT (p = 0.000), CIMT (p = 0.001), uric acid (p = 0.000), VLDL (p = 0.000), HOMA-IR (p = 0.000), ferritin (p = 0.000) CAP (p = 0.000), LSM (p0.000). A non-invasive model was formulated by which a value > 15 was accurate in identification of advanced fibrosis and cardiovascular risk with a sensitivity of 97.3%, specificity 97%.
Conclusion
The score correlated well with the results of liver biopsy and can be repeated with great flexibility to assess severity of NAFLD."

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrinopathy with unknown pathophysiology among women of reproductive age. Several studies have been conducted to determine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) among PCOS patients. However, the results were contradictory. The present study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of MetS in PCOS patients using the related published data.
Method
The present systematic review was perfumed based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The search was done using MeSH keywords in databases of PubMed, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, and Google scholar search engine as well as the reference list of the retrieved papers without time limit until October 2018. We used Cochran's Q test and I2 Index to evaluate the heterogeneity among the studies and the random effects model was used to combine the results. Data analysis was performed using Stata ver. 11.1.
Results
Forty six studies including 8946 patients with PCOS were included in the final analysis. Total heterogeneity was high (I2: 91.43%, P < 0.001). The prevalence of MetS in PCOS patients was estimated to be 30% (95%CI: 27–33). Subgroup analysis based on MetS diagnostic criteria showed an estimated prevalence of 0.27% (95%CI: 0.18–0.37), 0.30% (95%CI: 0.27–0.34), 0.32 (95%CI: 0.25–0.39), 0.32 (95%CI: 0.27–0.37) and 0.24 (95%CI: 0.14–0.34) for IDF, NECP-ATPIII, AHA NHLBI, CDS, and unknown criteria, respectively.
Conclusion
Considering the prevalence of MetS in PCOS patients, diagnosis of MetS in PCOS patients is necessary to reduce the mortality and morbidity rates."

Hyperlipidemia can be caused by abnormal elevation of lipids and lipoproteins in the blood. This increased can lead to heart disease. Risks which can be controlled include alcohol intake, physical activity, smoking, high blood pressure and genetic factors. Markers of increased cardiovascular risk appear to be lower in regular blood donor compared with single time donors as reflected by significantly lower total cholesterol and LDL levels. And it has been thought that there will be a direct relationship between lower risks of Heart diseases with repeated blood donation.
Aim
The aim of the present study is to determine the effect of blood donation on single time and repeat donors by assessing their lipid levels and their family history of heart diseases.
Material & methods
This cross-sectional study was carried out on (n = 80) random blood donors from the department of Transfusion Medicine KGMU.
Results
A significant correlation was found amongst hyperlipidemic level in single time donor & repeat donors and in donors with family history of heart diseases (p < 0.05). A positive association was found between hyperlipidemia with donor's weight (p < 0.05).
Conclusion
Screening random donor platelets for hyperlipidemia and correlating the condition with other donor criteria like family history of heart diseases, types of donors, donors weight age and gender will help in making the patients safe as well as the donor deferral criteria more stringent to improve the quality of blood supply and will enable blood bankers to supply safe blood and improve the guidelines for blood safety."

Dyslipidemia is an established marker for endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular risk in diabetes. So we aimed to explore the prevalence of dyslipidemia in patients with type2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and to determine the association between dyslipidemia and other health care and biochemical indicators.
Materials and methods
A cross-sectional study was carried out at private health care center. A total of 291 diabetic patients aged 18 years and above attended the clinic from August 2017 through April 2018 were included. Socio-demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were obtained from the medical records of patients. Statistical analysis was carried out using (SPSS, version 23).
Results
out of the 291 diabetes patients recruited 22.3% had hypercholesterolemia (TC ≥ 200) and 61.9% had hypertriglyceridemia. Abnormal LDL-C levels (≥130) were found in 8.9% of patients and HDL-C was less than 40 mg/dl in 54.3%. There was a statistically significant difference (P = 0.048) in abnormal HDL levels (˂ 40 mg/dl) among females (59.3%) and males (47.6). Patients with HbA1c values ≥ 7.0%had significantly higher values of total cholesterol (TC) and abnormal LDL-C compared with the patients who had HbA1c ˂ 7.0%.
Conclusion
dyslipidemia is highly prevalent among diabetic population particularly in those with poorly controlled diabetes. This calls for early and universal screening of lipid profile. There is also an urgent demand for measures that target tight glycemic, optimal lipid profile control and life style modifications is also required to all diabetic patients to achieve target value of HbA1C ≤ 7."

However, the question of whether school interventions, especially school education exert significant impact on childhood obesity or not, is left with mixing results. This article aims to holistically review the relationship between school education and childhood obesity. Various factors are covered, including health education, nutrition education, school nutrition, physical education, teachers’ awareness, teaching practice and school stress, In all, school education is not the answer to childhood obesity but just part of it.

Diabetes mellitus is a public health burden requiring a multi-sectorial approach including adequate population awareness to tackle this epidemic. The study was aimed to determine the level of diabetes awareness among a high-risk dysglycaemic population in relation to socio-demographic, lifestyle and family history of diabetes as well as to body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure measurements. Furthermore, the authors strived to explore any relationships between diabetes awareness and an oral glucose tolerance test dysglycaemia diagnosis.
Method
Participants obtaining impaired fasting blood glucose in a representative health examination survey were invited to undergo an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). During the OGTT session, participants were invited to take part in a diabetes awareness questionnaire as well as have their weight, height and blood pressure measured. Association between awareness scores and different parameters (age, gender, education, residential district, smoking, alcohol habit, family history, BMI and blood pressure) were explored.
Results
Being a female, ageing, non-smoker and having a family history of diabetes had a positive association with adequate diabetes awareness. Even though generally good awareness was present, the majority of the participants were obese, with an elevated blood pressure and obtained a dysglycaemic status post OGTT.
Conclusion
Diabetes awareness solely does not appear to engage individuals in preventive initiatives. Behavioural changes are required but these are only established after the motivational action gap has been overcome. Empowering community diabetes mellitus screening programs targeting the environment, social gradients and cultural norms while engaging in preventive interventions are recommended."

abstract = "Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) plays an essential role in overall glycemic management. Less focus is given on managing postmeal hyperglycemia despite the facts that, it is a common feature of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). The purpose of this narrative review is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the existing literature on the nutritional approaches to improve postmeal hyperglycemia in patients with T2D. We searched multiple databases for the studies examining the nutritional approaches to manage postmeal glucose in patients with T2D. We included studies that involve human trials that were published in English for the past 10 years. Our review of the current literature indicates that the postmeal hyperglycemia can be improved with four nutritional approaches. These approaches include (i) utilizing the appropriate amount and selecting the right type of carbohydrates, (ii) using specific types of dietary protein, (iii) manipulating the meal timing and orders and (iv) others (promoting postmeal physical activity, incorporating diabetes-specific formula and certain functional foods). The potential mechanisms underlying these approaches are discussed and the identified gaps warranted further research. This array of nutritional strategies provide a set of options for healthcare professionals to facilitate patients with T2D in achieving the optimal level of postmeal glucose."

abstract = "Background
Besides of dietary fat and carbohydrate, amino acids(AAs), as constituent components of dietary protein have been related with serum lipid levels. This study aims to examine the association between dietary AAs and prospective changes in serum lipid profile in adults.
Methods
Analyses were conducted on 3881 participants aged, 18–75 years of Tehran lipid and Glucose study, at baseline (2008–2011) and were followed for 3 years (2011–2014) to ascertain serum lipid profile changes. Dietary intakes of AAs were collected at baseline using food frequency questionnaire. Multiple linear regression adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, physical activity, smoking and daily intakes of energy, total fat, and fiber were used.
Results
The median(IQR) changes in triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were 6.0(-19.0, −35.5), 9.0(7.0, −24.0), 1.0(-3.0, −6.0), and 5.2(-8.0, −18.6) mg/dl, respectively. Higher intakes of isoleucine, lysine, tyrosine, alanine, threonine, methionine, valine, histidine, aspartic acid, and branched chain, alkaline, and alcoholic AAs were positively associated with TGs-changes in the final adjusted model, whereas tryptophan, glutamic acid, and acidic AAs were negatively related to TG-changes. Alanine and tryptophan were associated with higher and lower LDL-C-changes, respectively. Lysine, alanine, methionine, aspartic acid, and alkaline AAs showed positive association with changes in TC, whereas tryptophan and glutamic acid had a negative association with TC-changes.
Conclusion
Our findings showed that some dietary amino acids have the potential to increase or decrease serum lipid profile."

The present study aimed to evaluate the correlation between glycemic status and the inflammation biomarkers; leukocytes, platelets indices and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients regarding diabetic complications.
Methods
Study was conducted on 158 patients allocated as normal healthy subjects (50) and 108 patients diagnosed as T2DM. The diabetic patients were subdivided into six groups according to metformin administration as mono-or dual therapies.
Results
The current results exhibited a significant elevation in systolic blood pressure, total and LDL-cholesterol levels and IFN-γ as well as a noticeable decrease in HDL-cholesterol and anti-atherogenic factor values compared to the healthy patients. Leukocytes and neutrophils count, main platelets volume (MPV) and platelet distribution width (PDW) values revealed noticeable elevations in most treated T2DM groups, while a marked depletion was recorded in platelets count compared to healthy subjects. Glycemic control, most treated diabetic patients with metformin mono- and dual therapies showed an ameliorative effect in HbA1c, IFN-γ, MPV, and PDW values compared to recent diabetic ones.
Conclusion
Diabetes was correlated significantly with dyslipidemia and atherogenic risk in parallel with an increase in IFN-γ production and hematological inflammatory biomarkers; leukocytes, neutrophil/lymphocyte and platelet/lymphocyte ratios, MPV and PDW values. The amelioration in inflammatory biomarkers was associated with improvement in glycemic control."

Diabetes patients with renal impairment commonly have a degree of hematological abnormalities than those non-diabetics with chronic kidney disease. The present study aimed to clarify the association between oxidative stress and hematological abnormalities with the progression of diabetic nephropathy.
Methods
A total of 20 healthy subjects and 100 patients were enrolled in the study. Eligible renal dysfunction patients were classified according to biochemical markers into five groups (20 patients); diabetic patients, pre-renal failure patients, diabetic pre-renal failure patients, renal failure patients, and diabetic renal failure patients.
Results
Erythrocytes and platelets count, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels revealed a significant decrease in all renal dysfunction groups, while leukocytes count, red cell distribution width, platelet distribution width, and mean platelet volume showed significant increases in diabetic and renal dysfunction groups as compared to the healthy control. Nitric oxide level increased significantly, while reduced glutathione showed a marked decrease in diabetic and all renal dysfunction groups compared to the healthy control.
Conclusion
Nitric oxide and reduced glutathione were associated with the inflammatory status in diabetic renal dysfunction patients which reflected by elevation in leukocytes and neutrophils count, red cell distribution width as well as the reduction in values of erythrocytes, platelets count, hemoglobin and hematocrit. Therefore, hematological indices can play a role in predict the progression of diabetic nephropathy."

A search on combined diet and exercise interventions during pregnancy in women with GDM was performed in 3 electronic databases: PubMed (NCBI), ScienceDierct, and the Cochrane Library. Evaluated outcomes were fasting blood glucose levels, postprandial blood glucose levels, glycated hemoglobin percentages, total weight gain during pregnancy, proportion of caesarean delivery, proportion of patients needing insulin, neonatal birth weight, proportion of macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycemia, and preterm birth. This systematic review identified eight randomized, controlled trials involving 592 pregnant women and 350 infants. The risk of bias of the included trials ranged from high to low. The combined diet and exercise interventions reduced fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels when compared to dietary interventions. No significant differences were reported in the selected trials regarding total weight gain during pregnancy, cesarean section, neonatal birth weight, macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycemia, and preterm birth between diet plus exercise and diet groups. The combination of diet and exercise interventions help to control postprandial blood glucose concentration in women diagnosed with GDM, but did not change either maternal or newborn outcomes.

Epidemiological evidence suggests that melatonin has some effects on the serum lipid. However, these results are controversial. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to examine the effect of melatonin supplement on dyslipidemia and anthropometric indices.
Methods
We searched electronic databases including Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane Library up to Des 2018 without any language restriction. To compare the effects of melatonin with placebo, differences in standardized means difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were pooled using random effects model.
Results
Twelve trials including 641 participants included in meta-analysis finally. The dose of melatonin was reported at 0.8–30 mg. Comparing with the control group, melatonin may improve low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (−0.31 mmol/L, 95% CI (−0.61, 0.01), P = 0.049, I2 = 42%) and triglyceride (TG) level (SMD = −0.45 mmol/L; 95% CI, −0.77, −0.13, P = 0.006, I2 = 47%). No significant effect of melatonin on high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and anthropometric indices was found.
Conclusions
The results of our systematic review and Meta-analyzes showed that supplementation of melatonin could be effective in improving lipid parameters and should be considered in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, although the effect of this supplement on anthropometric indices needs further investigation."

Metabolic syndrome is a collection of physiological and biochemical abnormalities about 20–25% of adult population in developing countries is suffering from metabolic syndrome. Previous research demonstrated that adipose tissue plays an important role in energy regulation via endocrine, paracrine and autocrine signals as results of obesity due to accumulation of adipose tissue to excess that by time affects negatively both physical and psychological health and well being, it has been found that adipose tissues produces a variety of factors known as “adipokines” which play a key role in the development and progression of the disease and also hypothesized that adipokines are a possible link between obesity and the other risk components of the Metabolic syndrome. Many of the adipokines exert multiple actions in a variety of cellular processes leading to a complex array of abnormal characteristic of Metabolic syndrome. Abnormal production of these adipokines by expanded visceral fat during Adiposity contributes to a pro-inflammatory state. Increasing evidence suggests that aberrant production/release of adipokine from adipocyte i.e. adiponectin, leptin and resistin etc, may contribute to the health problems associated with Adiposity such as dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and atherosclerosis. This study conclusively have shown a significant role of adipokines secreted by adipose tissue and various metabolic risk markers play a important role in the development of Metabolic syndrome."

Diabetes mellitus type 2 (DMT2) is a major chronic condition that also common in older people, and associated with an increased risk of falling. This study aimed to determine the risk factor of fall in elderly with DMT2.
Methods
In this cross-sectional study, 220 elderly diabetic patients who had referred to diabetes center in Kerman were chosen via convenience sampling method. To collect data, Semi-structured Fall Risk questionnaire and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used.
Findings
The mean age was estimated to be 69.82 (SD: 9.9) years. Among the participants, 38.5% suffered falls in the past one year. Good sleep quality (OR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.1–0.85) and appropriate environment (OR = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.1–0.77) were significantly associated with a lesser odd of having recurrent falls.

Methods
This is a descriptive study conducted between January and March 2019 in Divinópolis, in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. Patients aged 18 years or older with CKD, DM and/or SAH were followed up at the municipal nephrology outpatient clinic. An interview was conducted using a structured questionnaire to assess care, which was categorized as adequate or inadequate, based on the health care recommendations of the national guidelines for care of patients with CKD.
Results
42 participants with CKD participated in the study. All participants had SAH and 42.9% (n = 18) also had DM. It was evidenced that 81.0% (n = 34) of the individuals with CKD had adequate health care, especially among patients in earlier stages (3A and 3B) and those who progressed to renal replacement therapy. However, 80.0% (n = 8) of the participants in the intermediate stage (stage 4) were inadequately followed up by the nephrologist and multidisciplinary team.

abstract = "For more than a century, the high occurrences of coronary and peripheral artery diseases in diabetes mellitus patients has been well recognised; despite that, the ability to improve CV event rates by optimizing glycaemic control has remained elusive. Nevertheless, the last decade has seen several cardiovascular outcome clinical trials (CVOTs) of many antihyperglycemic agents that reported promising results for cardiovascular and renal outcomes. This leads to a hot debate on the ideal drug choice for first-line treatment in T2DM. The purpose of this paper is to review the evidence supporting the use of metformin, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and incretin-based therapies for the management of individuals with T2DM and, discuss the rationale for selection."

abstract = "Background
In Indonesia, most of diabetic patients had periodontitis and 75.3% of them had severe periodontitis. Previous study found that hyperglycemia and or local inflammation (such as periodontitis) modulated systemic pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines.
Aims
This study aimed to investigate the effect of DM and or periodontitis on systemic cytokines and adipocytokines levels.
Methods and materials
A total of 57 participants with age of 29–71 years were recruited for this study. We divided them into three groups; DM-periodontitis (n = 22), periodontitis without DM (n = 16) and control (n = 19). All participants underwent physical examinations (BMI, WC, periodontal status examination) and laboratory examinations (FBG, fasting insulin, CRP, adiponektin, leptin, TNF-α and IL-10).
Results
The proportion of severe periodontitis were higher in DM-periodontitis group compared to periodontitis without DM (77.3% vs 6.2%). DM-periodontitis group had lower adiponectin levels than that of periodontitis without DM group [5860.78 ± 4182.40 vs 9553.13 ± 6794.73; p = 0.046]. TNF-α/IL-10 ratio was significantly higher in the periodontitis without DM compared to control group [1.96 (1.68–2.32) vs 1.55 (1.27–1.85); p = 0.015].
Conclusion
Local inflammation such as periodontitis, elevated systemic inflammatory markers (TNF-α/IL-10 ratio). Meanwhile chronic hyperglycemia alter adipocytokines level. The changes of systemic inflammation among diabetic group had not been shown yet in this study since some antidiabetic and antilipid drugs possess anti-inflammtory effect. Age, WC and FBG correlated with severe periodontitis. Adiponectin, leptin, TNF-α and IL-10 levels did not correlated with severe periodontitis."

abstract = "Background
Coronary artery disease (CAD), is one of the leading causes of death globally. CAD risk factors, such as smoking, dyslipidemia, and obesity, are mainly associated with increased oxidative stress. Heat Shock Protein-27 (HSP27) has a protective role in conditions of oxidative stress. The aim of the current study was to investigate the relationship between HSP27 mRNA copy numbers in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) and the degree of CAD progression.
Methods
A total of 103 subjects aged 49–71 years were recruited; Patients with CAD were categorized into two groups: patients having <50% stenosis (Angio−) and ≥50% stenosis (Angio+). The mRNA copy numbers of HSP-27 in PBMCs, anthropometric-parameters, fasting blood glucose (FBG), and the fasted serum lipid profile were evaluated.
Results
Angio+ patients had a significantly higher level of TC and LDL-C values compared with Angio− patients and the control group (p < 0.05). The HSP27 expression in PBMCs was significantly increased in Angio+ and Angio− subjects, compared to the control group. Moreover, there was a significant association between the FBG, TC, LDL-C and TG among the groups (p < 0.05).
Conclusion
It was shown that the increased expression of HSP27 in PBMCs of CAD patients is significantly correlated with CAD severity in Angio+ subjects, which can be used as an early prognostic biomarker, indicating the degree of overall oxidative stress in patients. In order to verify this statement, it is suggested to measure Pro-oxidant- Antioxidant Balance (PAB) test by the same design in subsequent studies."

To investigate the association of obesity phenotypes with non-obese components of metabolic syndrome (MetS) by considering the presence of general adiposity and central obesity.
Methods
We analyzed the data of population-based cross-sectional study of 981 adults’ individuals who were community dwelling in urban population of Babol, the north of Iran. The demographic characteristics and anthropometric measures and hypertension were collected with standard method by trained nurses. The fasting blood sugar, CHL, TG, HDL-C and LDL-C were measured by enzymatic method. The presence of cardiometabolic risk factors were analyzed according to the combination of obesity phenotypes either overweight/obese or central obese. The logistic regression model was used to calculate the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of obesity phenotypes in compared with normal weight not central obese in association of presence of metabolic abnormality.
Results
The 394 (40.6%) individuals were both overweight/obese and central obese and 295 (30.1%) persons were “normal weight not central obese” and the minority 28(2.9%) were normal weight but central obese and the remainder 260 (26.5%) were “overweight/obese not central obese”. Overweight/obese not central obese increased significantly the odds of presence of ≥2 non-obese components of metabolic abnormality by 2.17 times (95%CI OR: 1.51, 3.13) but the OR was elevated for the joint phenotypes of overweight/obese and central obese (OR = 4.16 (95%CI: 2.85, 6.06) as compare with normal weight not central obese.
Conclusions
Overweight/obese alone increased the risk of cardiometabolic abnormality but being overweight/obese and central obese a further elevated the risk compared with “normal weight not central obese”."

Diabetes is associated with Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) activation. Protective role of Angiotensin (1-7) has been recently identified. The study aims to identify associations between imbalance in RAAS components with vascular endothelial dysfunction and inflammation in diabetics with newly diagnosed hypertension.
Methods
Brachial Flow-mediated-dilation (FMD), Carotid Intima-media-thickness (CIMT), pulse-wave-velocity (PWV), Serum E-selectin, Vascular-Cell-Adhesion-Molecule-1 (VCAM-1), high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP), Interleukin-10 (IL-10), Renin, AngiotensinII, Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Angiotensin1-7 were measured in 60 diabetic patients with newly diagnosed hypertension. Patients with AngiotensinII/Angiotensin1-7 ratio <1 were classified as Favourable-Axis (FA) group (n = 22) and those with ratio >1 were classified as Unfavourable-Axis (UA) group (n = 38).
Results
hsCRP was higher [9.52 (4.64–16.19) vs 3.62 (1.77–13.09) (mg/l), p = 0.04], IL-10 was lower [2.26 (1.34–12.05) vs 10.98 (4.44–17.78) (pg/ml),p = 0.006], %FMD was lower [(5.51 ± 2.97) vs (7.66 ± 3.38) (%), p = 0.01] and CIMT was higher in UA compared to FA group [0.7 (0.55–0.79) vs 0.51 (0.49–0.65) (mm), p = 0.001].

Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations in fasting and postprandial reflect the metabolism of glucose by the human body and are useful in the diagnosis of metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and insulin resistance. In this work, these concentrations are jointly analyzed in Venezuelan women and 28 classes that better specify each metabolic condition are generated.
Materials and methods
Each class comprises a combination of fasting and postprandial ranges of glucose and insulin concentrations defined in the literature as normal, impaired and diabetic. A hypothesis test was used to find statistically significant differences between the classes, and confidence intervals for age and glucose and insulin concentrations were defined for each class.
Results and conclusion
The process of deterioration of glucose metabolism advances with the age of the subject, more than half of the prediabetics have impaired glucose levels in fasting but normal in postprandial and normal insulin levels in fasting and postprandial, and one third of diabetics have diabetic glucose levels in fasting and postprandial and normal insulin levels in fasting and postprandial. This categorization of subjects would allow the application of a more specific treatment and the possibility of predicting the progress of the metabolic disorder."

A cross-sectional study was conducted among 214 individuals using purposive sampling method. Somatometric measurements were taken using the ISAK protocol. Correlation analysis and odds ratio were calculated to determine the best predictor of hypertension.
Results
41% of males and 42.1% of females were found to be in Stage-II hypertension. BMI and WC were found to have the highest correlation with SBP among males and females, respectively. WHR followed by WC and BMI, was found to be the strongest predictor of hypertension in males. In the case of females, WHtR Followed by, BMI and WHR were found to be the strongest predictors of hypertension.
Conclusion
Among the presently studied Muslim population of Lucknow, a high prevalence of hypertension was found among both males and females. Also, WHR among males and WC among females were found to be better predictors of hypertension. Thus, for better prediction of risk of hypertension, sex and ethnicity-specific adiposity indicator should be used in clinical practice."

Trehalose is a naturally occurring disaccharide which is not synthesized in human but is widely used in food industries. Some studies have provided evidence indicating that it can potentially modulate glucose metabolism and help to stabilize glucose homeostasis in patients with diabetes. Studies have shown that trehalose can significantly modulate insulin sensitivity via at least 7 molecular pathways leading to better control of hyperglycemia.

Diabetes increases the odds of depression and depression is often associated with poor glycemic control and complications of diabetes. Vitamin D is also believed to improve glycemic control and ameliorate depressive symptoms. Therefore, we examined effects of vitamin D monotherapy (without antidepressant drugs) on depressive symptoms in Type 2 diabetic patients with mild to moderate depressive symptoms.
Methods
We conducted 12 weeks, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial on 68 subjects with T2DM and mild to moderate depressive symptoms. Subjects received 100 μg (4000 IU) vitamin D (n = 32) or placebo (n = 34) daily. Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI–II–PERSIAN) was applied for assessment of the severity of depression. Depression scores and metabolic profiles were measured at the beginning and end of trail.
Results
after 3 months of vitamin D supplementation, mean values of 25(OH) D increased from 15.5 ± 8.8 to 32.2 ± 8.9 ng/ml (p-value <0.001) in the vitamin D group. Moreover, BDI-II scores decreased from 15.2 ± 9.6 to 9.8 ± 7.2 (p-value <0.001) in the vitamin D group and 15.5 ± 11.2 to 13.7 ± 11.5 (p-value = 0.03) in placebo group. This decrease in BDI-II scores were significant (27.6% vs 10.8%) compared with placebo (p-value = 0.02). In term of metabolic profiles, mean change in level of Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), insulin and triglycerides (TG) were significantly higher in response to the treatment with vitamin D compared to placebo (p-value <0.02).
Conclusions
In conclusion, supplementation of vitamin D in T2DM patients may protect these patients against the onset of major depressive disorder (MDD), with noticeable favorable effects on measures of metabolic profiles.

No studies have evaluated the contribution of major dietary patterns to Sarcopenic Obesity (SO) in obese and overweight people based on quintile of skeletal muscle mass (SMM) and fat mass (FM). This study was conducted to examine the association between major dietary patterns and SO.
Method and material
A total of 301 overweight and obese women were included in the cross-sectional study. Body composition was measured by body composition analyzer. Resting metabolic rate was measured by indirect calorimetry. The usual food intake was evaluated by a semi-quantitative FFQ. Serum HDL-c, LDL-c, TG, FBS, total cholesterol and hs-CRP were measured.

Methods
In this descriptive, cross-sectional study, 255 diabetic patients and 255 non-diabetic subjects were recruited. Participants were randomly selected. The questionnaire recorded GI symptoms among the study population.
Results
GI symptoms were reported in 91.4% of diabetic patients, and 42.1% of them were male. The common GI symptoms in diabetic patients were flatulence (33.0%), followed by retrosternal pain (14.9%), belching (13.7%), postprandial fullness (12.5%), and constipation (11.4%). Retrosternal pain, constipation, flatulence, loss of appetite, and abdominal distention were more prevalent in diabetic women than men.
Conclusions
DM is associated with high prevalence rate of upper and lower GI symptoms. This effect may be linked to gender and poor glycemic control in diabetic patients, but not to type and duration of diabetes."

To determine whether or not adiponectin levels or basal metabolic rate (BMR) could predict worse risk stratification in patients with insulin resistance (IR) among metabolically healthy and unhealthy obese (MUHO) elderly females with Metabolic syndrome (MetS).
Methods
A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 109 elderly females in geriatric nursing home with MetS. The participants were reclassified according to adiponectin levels and IR.
Results
Group (1) (with IR, n = 41) compared to group (2) (without IR, n = 45) had lower squared adiponectin level and higher fat mass and fat percent (p value = 0.037, 0.030, and 0.035 respectively).

Insulin resistance is one of risk factors for sarcopenia and there is no specific equation for the measurement of muscle mass. The present study aimed to evaluate muscle mass in the patients with obesity, prediabetes (PDM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) by different equations for the measurement of muscle mass.
Methods
Obese patients aged 18–65 years old, who presented between 2013 and 2015 were reviewed and they were separated into three groups as obese, prediabetes (PDM) and diabetes mellitus (DM). Height, body weight, body mass index (BMI), sum of the appendicular lean masses (ALM) were measured in all participants. Body muscle mass ratio was calculated as the total muscle mass divided by the body weight, and skeletal muscle index was calculated as the total muscle mass divided by the square of the height. In addition, ALM/weight, ALM/height2 and ALM/BMI ratios were also evaluated.
Results
A total of 1107 participants, of whom 666 (60.2%) were female, were enrolled into the study. Of the participants, 288 (%26.02) had obesity, 524 (%47.33) had PDM and 295 (26.65%) had DM. There was a significant difference in ALM/BMI ratio between the three groups for both genders (p = 0.003 for female and p = 0.003 for male). ALM/weight ratio and body muscle mass ratio were decreased between groups in female, whereas it was no difference in male (p = 0.003, p < 0.001 for females, respectively; p = 0.802, p = 0.840 for males, respectively).
Conclusions
ALM/BMI may be more accurate for the evaluation of muscle mass in middle-aged obese, PDM and DM subjects."

PCOS is associated with various immediate and long term health complications. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of serum fasting insulin concentration with cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.
Methods
A total of 349 women, 249 women with polycystic ovary syndrome and 100 age-matched healthy controls, were recruited in this case-control study. Fasting insulin and various other biochemical, hormonal and clinical parameters were measured in all participants. The correlation of insulin with cardiometabolic risk factors was evaluated in PCOS women with normal and high serum insulin concentration.
Results
Fasting Insulin, BMI, WHR, FAI, LH: FSH, HOMA, QUICKI were significantly higher in PCOS women compared with healthy controls (p < 0.01). Fasting insulin showed a positive correlation with more cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors in PCOS compared to controls. The BMI, BAI, LAP, HOMA IR, QUICKI and FAI were significantly higher (all p < 0.05) in PCOS patients with higher insulin levels than with PCOS women with normal levels.

With limited resources and capability for HbA1c testing in most primary-care providers, this study explored patterns of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) tests for proper timing of HbA1c test would increase value of the money spent.
Methods
A retrospective review of laboratory findings of 4906 type-2 diabetic outpatients in two university hospitals in Thailand was conducted. Percentages of discordant results between the indexed FPG and HbA1c tests were compared between the patient groups with different FPG patterns before HbA1c testing and the control group of randomly selected cases.
Results
Having HbA1c tested after two and three consecutively normal FPG tests (OO and OOO patterns) were found to have significantly less discordance than the control group (−9.6% and −15.7%). HbA1c testing after two abnormal and one normal consecutive FPG tests (XXO pattern) gained the discordant results by 24.8%.
Conclusions
Some FPG patterns were more predictive of HbA1c findings than focusing on one-time FPG results. Reviewing and recognizing certain patterns of FPGs prior to taking HbA1c tests can lead to better HbA1c testing decision than randomly prescribing the tests."

The main of this study was to investigate the association between the rs566442 (V1119V) coding polymorphism of Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) with obesity and basal metabolic rate in Iranian postmenopausal women.
Methods
This cross-sectional study was performed on 350 postmenopausal women with a mean age of 57.8 years (SD ± 6.14). Body composition was analyzed by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) resistance. Obesity was defined based on Body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2. To determine the genotype of SNP (rs556442), PCR-RFLP assay was performed and confirmed by sequencing. DNA samples from participants were genotyped using the RFLP-PCR method.
Results
Among the study population 37.1% (130) were obese. G allele had minor-allele frequency of 0.38% in our population. The frequency of genotypes in our study population was 12.9% (45 person) GG, 35.7% (125 person) AA and 51.4% (180) GA. After adjusting age and menopausal age, only basal metabolic rate showed significantly higher in GG group compare to other groups (p = 0.02). Our data showed basal metabolic rate was higher in obese women with GG genotype in comparison to obese women with AG and AA genotypes.
Discussion
The findings of this study suggest that the GG genotype of SNP (rs556442) could protective role in obese women through the association with BMR."

Although, insulin plays a vital role in the treatment of diabetes, conventional basal insulins have certain limitations, which have led to the development of more stable and peak less analogues.
Objectives
To analyze the efficacy and safety of second generation vs. first generation basal insulins, and the efficacy and safety of second generation vs. second generation basal insulins, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, from the evidence provided by head-to-head randomized controlled trials.
Methods
The following electronic databases were searched: PubMed and MEDLINE, Scopus, BIOSIS, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, Google Scholar, and Springer Online Archives Collection, from January 1966 to October 2018. Articles resulting from these searches and relevant references cited in those articles were examined.
Results
The efficacy among insulins evaluated was similar, however, second generation insulins cause a lower risk of hypoglycemia compared to first generation insulins. A single study showed similar metabolic control with subtle differences in the risk of hypoglycemia among second generation insulins.
Conclusions
The second-generation basal insulins result in metabolic control similar to first generation insulins, with lower risk of hypoglycemia. Second-generation insulins have comparable efficacy, with some differences in the risk of hypoglycemia."

cross section control study enrolled 90 control group and 105 patients with PCOS and they were stratified according to their body mass index (BMI) to; underweight (n = 9, BMI ˂19), normal weight (n = 25, BMI = 19.1–25), over weight (n = 34,BMI = 25.1–30), obese grade I (n = 12, BMI = 30.1–35) , obese grade II (n = 13, BMI 35.1–40) and obese grade III (n = 12, BMI˃40).Circulating KISS levels were measured using ELISA.
Results
Our results revealed that, KISS levels were higher in PCOS patients compared to controls. Among PCOS group, there were significant lower level of KISS levels in underweight, overweight and obese compared to normal weight group. Even more importantly, KISS levels decreased with increasing of BMI as the following, grade I, grade II and grade III. Moreover, it was negatively correlated to anthropometric measures, glycemic, lipid profile and positively correlated the phenotype characteristics of PCOS. Linear regression test observed that hirsutism score, HOMA-IR and LH were the main predictors of KISS levels in PCOS.

Traditional journal level metrics, as the impact factor or Scimago journal ranking indicator (SJR) measure the impact of research on other researchers, but fail to assess the reach of these publications among wider audiences. This study aims to assess the correlation between SJR and metrics of presence on social networks of endocrinology journals.
Materials and methods
Journals within the area of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism were identified from the electronic portal Scimago Journal and Country Rank, and their metrics based on the number of citation collected. Different metrics of the presence on social networks, such as the number of followers and number of tweets, were assessed. The correlation between both metrics was evaluated by calculating the Spearman correlation coefficient.
Results
Of the 232 journals evaluated, 28 (12.1%) had social networks. The median SJR (1.53 vs 0.60, p < 0.01), and H index (58.5 vs 22, p < 0.01) were significantly higher among journals with social networks. The correlation between the number of followers on twitter and the SJR was moderate (r = 0.60, p < 0.05), and it was better in journals with more than 500 publications in the last 3 years (r = 0.85, p < 0.05). The number of tweets also had a moderate correlation with the SJR (r = 0.59, p < 0.05)
Conclusions
Our results suggest that the dissemination of research on social networks is moderately related to the traditional metrics of impact. Both types of metrics offer complementary information: while metrics based on social media may not perfectly predict the impact a scientific journal, it does have the advantage of immediacy."

Physical activities of daily living (ADL) constitutes one of diabetes management options. This study aimed to assess the extent that ADL and BMI are evaluated among diabetes patients in hospital practice.
Method
This was a clinical observational baseline study in two hospitals. Audit of medical files was performed to assess if BMI and occupations were recorded (N = 112). Afterwards, ‘N = 38’ who consented to participate in prospective study were conveniently sampled to assess ADL in relation to accessible metabolic syndrome tests. A validated questionnaire was used to collect data, which were analysed using SPSS version 20.
Results
Audit shows 55/112 of clients’ occupation were taken, of which 31% has BMI record. Those with lipid profile results are without blood pressure and vice versa. In the cross-sectional assessment, 74% are in physically demanding ADL occupations, but affirmed inactivity is 98% on leisure exercise. Further, 47% have BMI >25 kg/m2 and were consistently less active on all leisure ADL relative to those with BMI <25 kg/m2 (p < 0.02).
Conclusion
This report highlights oversight in clinical practice, whereby accessible metabolic syndrome parameters and occupation of clients living with diabetes are being assessed inconsistently. This implies an unmet need in the integration BMI and occupational information to improve diabetes self-management."

Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a major health problem worldwide. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of lifestyle modification regarding MS components among adult females.
Methods
An intervention study performed on 120 adult females with MS (60 intervention and 60 controls) selected randomly from Zagazig University outpatient clinics. Intervention group received patient education program while controls received traditional management. MS components were compared with three months interval representing Pre-Post follow up results.
Results
Two groups showed significant improvement in all MS components but mean change was significantly higher in intervention group. Three months follow up demonstrated that 63.4% of intervention group had reversal of their MS versus 15% of control group.
Conclusion
Patient education improved all MS components and considered significantly more effective than traditionally adopted management. So, we recommend its application on all MS patients."

Using Medical Subject Headings terms, Emtree, and related equal Persian key words, international databases including PubMed, ISI/WOS, Scopus, Iran Medex, SID, Magiran, Irandoc, Medlib, domestic databases were searched from January 1990 till January 2018 reporting prevalence of any complications of type 2 diabetes in Iran. All the keywords were searched electronically by two Boolean operators through the explained search strategy, separately. Relevant additional articles were identified from the lists of the retrieved articles. Random and fixed effect meta-analysis was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of complications in Iranian patients with T2DM. Through searching steps, among 1238 publications retrieved from literature search, finally 45 studies met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis, with number of 30679 participants. According to random effect, the estimated pooled prevalence of diabetic foot ulcer, cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy in Iranian patients with T2DM were 3%(95% CI: 1–5%), 33%(95% CI: 16–49%), 36%(95% CI: 27–45%), 38% (95% CI: 14–63%), and 43% (95% CI: 27–60%), respectively. This updated meta-analysis shows that prevalence of major microvascular complications of T2DM in Iran is high. Our findings provide practical evidence for better planning and clinical decision making."

Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease that manifested as hyperglycemia due to the defect in secretion or function of insulin. This study aimed was to survey about frequency type I and II diabetes in newly diagnosed diabetic patients base on c-peptide and anti-glutamate acid decarboxylase (GAD) tests.
Materials & methods
This study was conducted as a prospective study on 70 diabetic patients aged 15–45 years old who referred to diabetes clinics in Ahvaz city during 2012–2014 and their diabetes was diagnosed for the first time, but their type of diabetes was not clinically definitive. Patients with anti-GAD positive and fasting C-peptide level of less than 0.65 were diagnosed as type I diabetes. Patients with anti-GAD negative fasting C-peptide level of greater than or equal to 0.65 were considered as type II diabetes.
Results
Eighty two patients (49 males and 33 females) with a mean age of 21.64 ± 4.36 years (range 15–34) and a mean BMI of 22.05 ± 4.41 kg/m2 (range 14–18) were studied. Twenty three patients (28.5%) had type I diabetes and 59 patients (71.95%) had type II diabetes. In patients with type I diabetes, the mean BMI was 24.86 ± 2.36 kg/m2 and the number of patients with family history (56.22%) was higher. In type II diabetic patients, the number of women (62.71%) was higher than that of men.
Conclusion
Anti-GAD test can be used as a predictive test for early diagnosis of disease and screening of people with a diagnosis of diabetes based on the type of diabetes."

Despite the critical status of obesity as an epidemic chronic illness in the United States contributing toward diabetic and cardiovascular disease as well as early preventable death, treatment approaches in primary care remain in conflict; providers lack evidence-based guidelines toward impactful disease management, particularly from dietary approaches. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of initiation of a 5–10% low-carbohydrate, 75–85% high-fat diet on specific clinical indicators of obesity, a metabolic disease associated with increased morbidity and mortality, at baseline and six months in an adult population.
Materials and methods
Utilizing a retrospective electronic medical record data collection protocol, one hundred patients with obesity in a wellness clinic in the Southwestern United States between 2017 and 2018 prescribed a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet were selected via simple random sampling. Measurements of body mass index, hemoglobin A1C, and lipid levels were extracted at baseline and six months after initiation.
Results
Mean differences of each biomarker at baseline and six months were analyzed utilizing paired samples t-testing in SPSS and demonstrated statistically-significant improvement across each category. Body mass index decreased, hemoglobin A1C decreased, and each of three clinically-relevant lipid level measurements moved numerically toward normal-value ranges.
Conclusion
Data from this sample of 100 patients with obesity suggest body weight, diabetic, and cardiovascular status improvement from a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet over six months, affording a prescriptive nutrition option for primary care providers to consider prior to or as a complement to pharmacologic management."

There has been an increasing number of reports regarding the correlation between obesity and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Visceral fat thickness is thought to be a risk factor for GERD and its severity. Several studies have conflicting results, so this study aimed to determine visceral fat thickness difference between erosive and non-erosive reflux disease.
Methods
A cross-sectional study of 56 adult subjects with GERD symptoms was held at Cipto Mangunkusumo National General Hospital between April and November 2018. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Questionnaires (GERDQ) were utilized to determine the presence of GERD. Ultrasonography was used to determine visceral fat thickness. Esophageal erosions were diagnosed using upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The difference in visceral fat thickness between esophagitis and non-esophagitis group was analysed using T-test.
Results
From 56 total subjects, 55.4% have erosive reflux disease (ERD), in which were dominated by subjects with grade A esophagitis (64.5%) based on Los Angeles Classification of Esophagitis (LA classifications). There was no significant difference of visceral fat thickness between non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) and ERD (p = 0,831). There was, however, an increasing trend of visceral fat thickness with the advancing severity of esophagitis, although statistical significance was not reached.
Conclusion
Visceral fat thickness as measured by ultrasonography has no significant difference between NERD and ERD."

To investigate which of two indexes (TyG or TG/HDL) are the best predictors for insulin resistance (IR) and to evaluate the magnitude of each cardiometabolic risk factor in Mexican schoolchildren of 5–9 years with overweight-obesity and normal weight.
Material and methods
We realized a comparative cross-sectional prospective study in accordance of STARD guidelines. Setting was Family Medicine Unit (FMU) No. 80 of Mexican Institute of Social Security(IMSS) of Morelia, Michoacán, Mexico. Children between 5 and 9 years, both genders, 104 with normal weight(NW), 97 with Overweight-Obesity(OO Group) were included. Once the informed consent was signed we obtained the BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure(BP) and 5 mL of blood collected for glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, uric acid and insulin. As main outcome measures TyG or TG/HDL, HOMA-IR, and Receiving Operating Curves(ROC), sensitivity, specificity by ROC were obtained.
Results
Cutoff point TyG: 8.5 by ROC had an area under curve (AUC):0.802 IC95% 0.77to0.893, P = 0.0001; diagnostic accuracy of 73%. TG/HDL: 2.22; AUC:0.729 IC95% 0.622to0.837, P = 0.014; diagnostic accuracy of 52%. TyG can identify cardiometabolic alterations more than HOMA and TG/HDL. Cardiometabolic alterations in the OO group were hypertriglyceridemia:49.5%, low HDL:63.9%, IR:39.2% and in NW group were hypertriglyceridemia:30.8%, low HDL:60.6%, IR:9.6%.
Conclusions
We reported high frequency of hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL in Mexican children. TyG and TG/HDL are good predictors for IR. TyG has a better diagnostic accuracy. We need implementing TyG for identifying alterations and intervening in a timely manner to delay the onset of chronic diseases in children."

Empagliflozin is a potent SGLT2 inhibitor used to improve glycemic control in adults with T2DM. It has the highest SGLT2 specificity among all the clinically used or currently tested SGLT2 inhibitors. Low risk of hypoglycemia, absence of weight gain and demonstrated cardiovascular risk reduction support its consideration as a first line medication in addition to metformin for patients with T2DM and cardiovascular disease.

Data to support the use of risk scores in screening programs to detect people with prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes in low- and middle-income countries are limited. We evaluated a targeted screening program involving a diabetes risk score in a community setting in India in terms of its uptake, yield, and costs.
Methods
In the Kerala Diabetes Prevention Program, 2586 individuals (age 30–60 years) without known diabetes were screened using a two-step procedure. Step 1: screening with the Indian Diabetes Risk Score at participants’ homes by trained non-medical staff. Step 2: oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) among those with IDRS score ≥60 (“screen-positive”) at community-based clinics. Screening costs were expressed in 2013 US dollars.
Results
96.3% of those invited for the IDRS screening consented and 79.1% of screen-positives attended clinics for an OGTT. Older age and male gender were associated with higher IDRS uptake. Female gender, higher monthly household expenditure, and higher IDRS score were associated with higher OGTT uptake. The number needed to screen (yield) to detect one person with prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes was two and six, respectively. The average screening cost of identifying one person with prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes was $33.8 and $116.5, respectively.
Conclusion
This targeted screening program had a high uptake and high yield for prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes in a community setting in India. Alternative strategies are likely required to enhance the uptake of screening in certain groups."

Serum uric acid (SUA) has been shown to be a predictor of renal disease progression in most but not all studies. This study aims to test whether renal function-normalized SUA {i.e, SUA/creatinine (Cr) ratio} is a predictor of decreased renal function among diabetic patients.
Methods
The subjects comprised 185 men aged 72 ± 11 (mean ± standard deviation) years and 175 women aged 77 ± 10 years from a rural hospital. We examined the relationship between SUA/creatinine (Cr) ratio and renal function evaluated by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study Group equation.
Results
Annual eGFR decline rate was significantly increased with increased tertile of baseline SUA/Cr ratio (p = 0.011), and prevalence of the rapid progression types (≥3.0 ml/min/1.73 m2/year) was significantly higher in the second and third tertile (≥7,21) of baseline SUA/Cr ratio than the first tertile (<5.86) (p = 0.032). Pearson‘s correlation coefficient showed that baseline SUA/Cr ratio (r = 0.136, p = 0.012) as well as systolic blood pressure (SBP) and SUA were significantly correlated with annual eGFR decline rate. Multiple regression analysis using annual eGFR decline rate as an objective variable, adjusted for confounding factors as explanatory variables, showed that baseline SUA/Cr ratio (β = 0.334, p < 0.001) as well as gender and SBP were significantly and independently associated with annual eGFR decline rate. The multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) (95% confidence interval) of the baseline tertile of the SUA/Cr ratio for rapid progression of annual eGFR decline rate were 1.0, 3.15 (1.66–5.95) and 3.19 (1.57–6.51), respectively.

Our data demonstrated that baseline SUA/Cr ratio was independently and significantly associated with future renal function decline among diabetic patients."

Intervention was provided by pharmaceutics students, and accompanied by an academic course. We further examined the effect of the pedagogical format by which students were taught on HbA1c levels of the patients. The format of the academic course varied: the simultaneous format included theoretical, clinical, and practical themes taught within each lesson; whereas in the non-simultaneous format, theoretical themes were taught during the first several lessons, followed by practical skills taught in the following ones. T2DM patients (n = 171) were recruited through 10 primary care clinics. The inclusion criterion was patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (HbA1c > 7%). Patients were randomly allocated to a training or control group. Pharmaceutics students (n = 85) in their fourth year participated in an academic course and were randomly allocated to a simultaneous vs. non-simultaneous pedagogical format. The interaction effect between intervention type and pedagogical format was significant. Only patients who participated in the training group consisting of students who participated in the simultaneous course format showed improvement on their HbA1c levels. Implications on patients' outcome and suggestions for future studies are discussed."

Diabetes in Sudan is real health challenge for health authorities especially optimum glycemic control and complications in particular diabetic septic foot. This is study aimed to assess knowledge of individuals with diabetes about self-foot care.
Methods
This is descriptive cross sectional, health facility-based study conducted in diabetes center in Khartoum, Sudan. The study recruited 150 individuals with diabetes. Data was collected using a standardized pretested questionnaire.
Results
Among the participants 64.7% were females and 35.3% were males, 36% of the participants were between the age of 51–60 years old. Good glycemic control (HbA1c) were achieved by 41.3% only. The participants who had good knowledge about diabetic foot self-care were 46.7%, poor knowledge 29.3% and moderate knowledge 24%. Good self-practice toward diabetic foot self-care was reported by 42.6%, moderate by 36.7% and poor practice by 20.7%. The awareness and practices significantly correlated with an increase in ages (≥51 years), higher level of education, medium income, unemployment, longer duration of diabetes > 10years, family history, controlled diabetes mellitus and education about diabetes complications and diabetic foot care (P value < 0.05).
Conclusions
Only (46.7%) of participants address good awareness and practices about self-foot care. Accordingly, there is a great need to provide continuous health education to the patients about diabetic foot self-care and this knowledge-application gap must be narrowed down."

abstract = "Aim of the study
Bariatric surgery causes profound improvement in metabolic parameters by increasing plasma glucagon like peptide - 1 (GLP-1) level even few weeks after surgery. GLP-1 analogues can cause calcitonin secreting medullary thyroid carcinoma in animals. The studies relating to the mechanisms that underlie these changes are few. The objectives of the study were to measure the change in insulin resistance, beta cell function, GLP-1 and calcitonin levels before and 2 weeks after bariatric surgery.
Methods
Patients above 18 years of age who underwent either laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy or Roux-en Y gastric bypass were recruited into the study. Measured indices were homeostatic model assessment 2 for insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR), an index for hepatic insulin resistance; Matsuda index, an index of whole body insulin sensitivity; and insulin secretion and sensitivity index (ISSI-2), a marker of beta cell secretion.
Results
Twenty eight patients completed the study. HOMA2-IR was lower (2.72 ± 1.28 vs. 2.04 ± 0.9; P = 0.001) and ISSI-2 was higher (0.80 (0.51–1.26) vs. 1.04 (0.56–1.38); P = 0.019) at 2 weeks after surgery compared to baseline. Matsuda index also improved after surgery but was not statistically significant (2.02 (1.1–2.94) vs. 2.84 (1.56–4.12); P = 0.078). Fasting GLP-1 and calcitonin levels did not change while both peak GLP-1, and area under curve for GLP-1 were higher after surgery.
Conclusions
At 2 weeks following bariatric surgery, hepatic insulin resistance decreased while beta cell function improved due to increase in postprandial GLP-1 level without any change in fasting calcitonin levels."

Asymptomatic patients with diabetes show structural and functional vascular damage that includes impaired vasodilation, arterial stiffness, increased intima-media thickness and calcification of the arterial wall. Subclinical vascular injury associated with diabetes predicts subsequent manifestations of cardiovascular disease, such as ischemic heart disease, peripheral artery disease and stroke. Noninvasive detection of subclinical vascular disease is commonly used to estimate cardiovascular risk associated to diabetes. Longitudinal studies in normotensive subjects show that arterial stiffness at baseline is associated with a greater risk for future hypertension independently of established risk factors. In patients with type 2 diabetes, vascular disease begins to develop during the latent phase of insulin resistance, long before the clinical diagnosis of diabetes. In contrast, patients with type 1 diabetes do not manifest vascular injury when they are first diagnosed due to insulin deficiency, as they lack the preceding period of insulin resistance. These findings suggest that insulin resistance plays an important role in the development of early vascular disease associated with diabetes. Cross-sectional and prospective studies confirm that insulin resistance is associated with subclinical vascular injury in patients with diabetes, independently of standard cardiovascular risk factors. Asymptomatic vascular disease associated with diabetes begins to occur early in life having been documented in children and adolescents. Insulin resistance should be considered a therapeutic target in order to prevent the vascular complications associated with diabetes."

Adipolin and cathepsin S are intricately involved in pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and prediabetes (PreDM).
Aims & methods
This cross-sectional study aimed to compare and correlate between these metabolic biomarkers as well as between them and adiposity, atherogenicity and hematological indices in MetS patients. Our cross-sectional study involved recruiting 29 normoglycemic MetS, 30 newly diagnosed drug naïve PreDM-MetS patients versus 29 lean, healthy and normoglycemic controls.
Results
Adipolin and cathepsin S plasma levels were significantly higher in both MetS (normoglycemic and PreDM) groups vs. healthy controls. Evidently proportional adipolin-cathepsin S association was markedly signified in 59 MetS participants (normoglycemic and PreDM). Distinctively unlike adipolin, inverse cathepsin S-diastolic blood pressure (DBP) but direct cathepsin S-monocyte count and its monocyte -to- lymphocyte ratio cross-correlated were marked. Notably unlike cathepsin S, adipolin was positively associated with each of FPG, A1C and TG, visceral adiposity index, lipid accumulation product and atherogenic index of plsama in the MetS pool of participants (N = 59).
Conclusions
Given the intergroup discrepancies in adiposity, atherogenicity indices and their correlations (as well as hematological indices) with biomarkers; this cross-sectional study cannot rule out either biomarker as an associative predictor or as a surrogate indicator and putative prognostic tool for the prediction/prevention and treatment of metabolism dysregularities."

Obesity and overweight which are consequence of some interaction factor such as genetics and behavioral habit. Obesity as a metabolic disorder and chronic inflammation is a trigger to countless disease. The main goal of this study is to investigate the interaction of herbal diet on the levels of liver enzymes, inflammatory factors and adipocytes profile.
Materials and methods
A total of 240 adult women range of 18–48 years were included in the current comparative cross-sectional study. Body composition and dietary intake (using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) were assessed in all participants. In determining a plant based diet index (PDI), vegetarian foods were taken positive score and reverse points for animal foods. For determining a healthful plant based diet index (hPDI), healthy plant foods received positive scores, while less healthy plant foods and animal foods received reverse scores. To create an unhealthful plant-based diet index (uPDI), positive scores were assigned to less healthy plant foods and reverse scores to healthy plant foods and animal foods. For the measurement of serum liver enzymes and inflammatory factors, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method was used.
Results
Healthy diet like whole grains, fruits, vegetables, cereals, and beverages such as tea and coffee, based on dietary guidelines, significantly reduced the amount of hs-CRP and TGF-β (P < 0.0001). Higher adhering to hPDI may as a result in higher intake of fiber intake, antioxidants, unsaturated fats, micronutrients, could reduce saturated fats and iron content, and finally weight loss, and reduce inflammation in the body.
Conclusion
Base on our finding, in those people who intake higher amounts of healthy plant foods, (vegetable types), instead of unhealthy herbal foods (sweets and desserts), might be useful to reduce inflammation factor like TGF-β and hs-CRP. Women with a higher compliance score in uPDI group (juices, refined grains, starches sweetened with sugar, sweets, and desserts) did not have significantly increase in inflammatory factors levels."

The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is responsible for an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and is associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Economic and social vulnerability is not an easy concept to grasp, but some studies investigate the association between MetS and socioeconomic and demographic factors, deprivation (more often correlations rather than causal one due to data). This work aims to assess the association between MetS and socio-economic gradient (SEG) in the literature by performing a meta-analysis.
Design
The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement for systematic reviews were followed.
Setting
The raw list of studies extracted from PubMed as regard to the inclusion/exclusion criteria was imported in Word. Studies were filed with regard to our three definitions of SEG and their title.
Participants
Subgroup analysis were performed considering several definitions of Mets: NCEP-ATPIII and IDF2006.
Results
The overall multivariable-adjusted OR showed that the risk of MetS was significantly increased in association with SEG The results of the subgroup analysis showed an increased risk of MetS in association with SEG when IDF definition was considered.
Conclusions
Targeted interventions must be implemented in a specific way as prevention campaigns aimed at the general population are generally not adapted to this particular vulnerable population."

Many studies have been conducted on the treatment of NAFLD; nevertheless, there is still no approved drug treatment for this disease. Although the pathogenesis of NAFLD is not fully understood, but inflammation, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, obesity and dyslipidemia are among the main causes. Epidemiological studies have shown that hypovitaminosis D is associated with these factors causing NAFLD. In addition, rate of Vitamin D deficiency has been shown to be directly related to the severity of NAFLD. Accordingly, it is believed that vitamin D may help to treatment of NAFLD by improving the above-mentioned risk factors. The purpose of this review is to survey the recent advances in the field of Vitamin D efficacy on risk factors and the severity of NAFLD based on existing evidence, especially the clinical efficiency of vitamin D supplementation in patients with NAFLD."

GLP-1 analogues decrease food intake and have great promise for the fight against obesity. Little is known about their effects on food hedonic sensations and taste perception in poor controlled patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
Materials and methods
Eighteen T2D patients with BMI ≥25 kg/m2 and poor controlled glycemia were studied before and after 3 months of treatment with Liraglutide. Detection thresholds for salty, sweet and bitter tastes, optimal preferences, olfactory liking, wanting and recalled liking for several food items were assessed. Subjects also answered questionnaires to measure their attitudes to food.
Results
T2D patients had a significant decrease in bodyweight and HbA1c after treatment with Liraglutide. Liraglutide improved gustative detection threshold of sweet flavors, and decreased wanting for sweet foods and recalled liking for fatty foods. It also led to a decrease in feelings of hunger.
Conclusions
Liraglutide increases sensitivity to sweet tastes and decreases pleasure responses for fatty foods in poor controlled T2D patients, and is of particular interest in the understanding of the mechanisms of weight loss.

Obesity is a major contributor to preventable disease and death across the globe. Obesity is complex. Although its risk factors are myriad and compounding, there is an urgent need for a deeper understanding of the way risk factors interact with each other. Leptin is a peptide regulates food intake and body weight. However, the notion of leptin as an anti-obesity hormone was called into question because obesity is typically associated with high leptin levels and not leptin deficiency thus, we aimed to measure leptin levels in obese female in correlation to anthropometric measures and to evaluate the impact of weight loss on its level and metabolic parameters.
Subject and methods
case-control study enrolled 40 control groups, 50 obese women. We measured anthropometric measures BMI, Waist/hip ratio (WHR). Fat mass index (FMI%) and free fat mass index (FFMI%) were assessed by dual energy X-Ray absorptiometry (DEXA) The serum levels of leptin were measured by ELISA.
Results
Our results revealed that serum leptin levels were higher in obese women compared to controls. Moreover, it was positively correlated to anthropometric measures, glycemic and lipid profile. Linear regression analysis revealed that BMI was the main independent studied parameters associated with serum leptin level among other clinical and laboratory biomarkers. Interestingly, after 12 weeks of following the Mediterranean diet (MD)–based weight loss program, serum leptin levels were decreased. Logistic regression analysis was performed to detect the main predictors' biomarkers associated with weight loss among obese women. We found that serum leptin and FMI% were an independent predictor of response with odds ratios of 1.69 and 1.64 respectively (P < 0.001), Receiver operating characteristic analyses revealed that the AUC of serum leptin in discriminating obese women from lean ones was 0.893 (95% CI = 0.815–0.917) with sensitivity = 90%, specificity = 96%, and the cutoff values was 36.32 ng/ml.
Conclusion
Serum leptin could be a valuable diagnostic marker of obesity and its comorbidities. Moreover, significant weight loss leads to decrease serum leptin levels and improvement of glycemic and lipid profiles."

Glucose tolerance abnormalities are frequently observed in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD). Insulin resistance (IR) has been suggested to be a major factor responsible for these abnormalities in CLD. However studies relating IR with severity of CLD are scarce in Nigeria. This study assessed insulin resistance and glucose tolerance abnormalities in CLD and their relationship with the severity of CLD in a tertiary hospital in South-West, Nigeria.
Methods
This cross sectional study involved 100 subjects with CLD. Ethical clearance was obtained and informed consent was granted by participants. Participants were interviewed using a structured proforma; physical examination and relevant investigations were performed. Insulin resistance was measured using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) Data was analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 20.0 and p value of <0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Mean age of the study participants was 51.9 ± 11.9 years, and mean duration of CLD was 15.9 ± 5.8 months. Glucose tolerance abnormalities were present in 66 subjects (66%) and increased from 16.1% in Child Pugh's class A to 90.0% in class C. HOMA-IR positively correlated with age, body mass index, serum blood glucose, duration and severity of CLD. Increasing age, presence of hepatocellular carcinoma, Child Pugh's class B and class C were associated with glucose tolerance abnormalities.
Conclusion
Glucose tolerance abnormalities and insulin resistance were highly prevalent among chronic liver disease subjects studied and seemed to parallel the severity of CLD, determined by the Child Pugh's score."

Observational study with cross sectional approach conducted on 102 outpatient subjects at Dr. RSUP Wahidin Sudirohusodo (RSWS) hospital and Hasanuddin University Hospital in the period of July–September 2018.
Results
Subjects with IR were found to be significantly higher for having MetS (88.23% vs. 11.77% p = 0,000). In subjects with IR, the average serum uric acid level was higher compared to non-IR subjects, but this difference was not significant (6.63 vs 6.42 mg/dL; P = 0.325). In subjects with MetS, the average serum uric acid level was higher compared to subjects with non-MetS but this difference was not significant (6.62 vs. 6.28 mg/dL; P = 0.556). No significant relationship was found between IR and MetS with serum uric acid level.
Conclusion
Insulin resistance is related to the incidence of MetS and in both of these circumstances an independent tendency is found to increase uric acid levels. The role of insulin resistance in the relationship between metabolic syndrome and uric acid levels was not proven in this study."

Type 2 diabetes has a high spread and growing process. Using appropriate food diets is among therapeutic approaches has been applied for diabetic patients. Soya utilization has shown effective results in controlling metabolic abnormalities of these patients. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of soy nut on glycemic conditions, blood pressure, lipid profile, antioxidant effects and vascular endothelial function of these patients.
Methods
70 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly divided into two groups of the test (35 people) and control (35 people). The patients in the intervention group were subjected to 60 g soy nut diet as a part of daily protein for 8 weeks and the control group under the usual diet of diabetes. The fasting glucose, blood pressure, lipid profile, brachial blood flow, the level of serum E-Selectin and total antioxidant capacity in control and test group were assessed before and after diet.
Results
Consuming 60 g soy nut for 8 weeks significantly decreased the fasting blood glucose (P = 0.03), total serum cholesterol (P < 0.01), LDL-c (P = 0.01), and E-Selectin (P < 0.01) and increased the capacity of serum total antioxidants (P < 0.01), brachial blood flow (P < 0.01) but didn't have any significant effect on systolic/diastolic blood pressure, HDL-c, and TG.
Conclusion
Soy nut utilization in the patients with type-2 diabetes can significantly improve the glycemic condition, increase brachial blood flow, decrease E-selectin (improvement of endothelial function), increase serum total antioxidants and lipid profile but has no significant effect on blood pressure and HDL-c."

To compare the acute and chronic effects of high-intensity intermittent training (HIIT) and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) on indices of cardio-metabolic health: (HDL-c, total cholesterol, triglycerides, heart ratio, and phase angle/PhA) in physically active men.
Methods
Twenty active men were randomly allocated to HIIT (n = 10), or MICT (n = 10) for 5 weeks, three times per week. HIIT consisted of running 5 km with 1-min at 100% of maximal aerobic speed interspersed by 1-min passive recovery while subjects in MICT group ran continuously the same 5 km at 70% of maximal aerobic speed. Blood samples were collected at different moments during the first and last exercise session. Before and after 5 weeks of both exercise training protocols, heart ratio (during exercise session) and PhA were measured pre and post-exercise training.
Results
Fasting HDL-c levels did not change after 5 weeks of HIIT or MICT. Perceptual variation of HDL pre and post training (fed state) tended to differ between HIIT and MICT (p = 0.09). All lipoproteins parameters (HDL-c, total cholesterol, triglycerides and non-HDL) were increased in post-acute exercise session compared to pre-exercise during the first and last training session, these being observed after both training protocols. PhA and heart rate measured at different times during the first and last training session were not affected in both training protocols.
Conclusion
These results indicate that HIIT and MICT modify the post-exercise lipoprotein profile acutely. On the other hand, only HIIT tended to increase HDL-c levels chronically."

The aim of this study was to study the effects of metformin therapy on serum chemerin levels in some phenotypes of polycystic ovarian syndrome cases, and to correlate chemerin levels with insulin resistance parameters and with hormonal profile.
Material and methods
This study was carried on 100 polycystic ovary cases and 70 control women. These cases were further subdivided into obese and normal weight cases. Fasting serum chemerin was measured by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay method. Data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows 7.
Results
Before metformin therapy, the serum chemerin were significantly increased in PCOS cases as compared with the control cases. Also, a significantly higher chemerin levels were found in obese polycystic ovarian syndrome cases as compared with normal weight cases with polycystic ovarian syndrome. The serum chemerin levels were significantly positively correlated with glucose levels, insulin levels, and HOMA-IR in polycystic ovarian syndrome cases. After three months of metformin therapy, the serum chemerin, insulin, and HOMA-IR concentrations were significantly decreased in polycystic ovarian syndrome cases as compared with the levels before therapy.
Conclusion
The serum chemerin levels were significantly higher in cases of PCOS cases as compared with the controls. Metformin therapy resulted in a significant decrease in chemerin levels in polycystic ovarian syndrome cases. The analysis of Receiver Operation Characteristic curves of serum chemerin suggested that serum chemerin levels may be of value to evaluate the polycystic ovarian syndrome cases under various methods of treatments."

Periodontitis is the most common cause of chronic inflammation in diabetic patient. Both periodontitis and diabetes have detrimental effect on each other in terms of alveolar bone destruction and poor metabolic control, by continuous inflammatory mediator activation. Defect of bacteria elimination ability and monocyte hyper-responsiveness in diabetic patients leads to persistent elevation of systemic inflammatory mediators.

Diabetes mellitus is a commonly encountered diagnosis in hospitalised patients that is associated with prolonged admissions and mortality. One in six hospital beds in the UK are occupied by diabetes patients. Therefore, healthcare providers need to have a sound knowledge in managing in-patients with diabetes. Thus the aim of this clinical survey was to assess the diabetes-related knowledge of healthcare professionals in a district general hospital.
Methods
A 24-item questionnaire, based on the ‘Think Check Act (TCA)’ diabetes modules implemented by the Healthcare Improvement Scotland was issued to the medical and nursing staff. Simple statistics were used for data collation and analysis.
Results
30 questionnaires were completed by 10 doctors at varying stages of training, 17 nurses, 1 physician associate and 2 healthcare assistants. The mean percentage score of the participants were 57.4%. 22 (73.3%) correctly defined hypoglycaemia and 27 (90%) knew the location of hypo box and 7 (23.3%) were aware of TCA. Responses to other management related to diabetes emergencies were average. The responses between doctors and nurses were insignificant except for hypo box location (p = 0.0413).

Conventional therapies to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) complications are only partially effective. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches leading to additional risk reduction are required. While many anti-diabetic medications have been prescribed world-wide for controlling T2DM over the past half-century, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are relatively new. In addition to their plasma glucose lowering effect, SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to reduce considerably cardiovascular mortality rate in patients with T2DM.
Aim
Since, a risk and benefit analysis of co-administration of SGLT2 inhibitors and other anti-diabetic agents in patients who suffer from hypertension, heart failure or renal deficiency is currently lacking, the main objective of this article is to review the recent literature and provide the health care professionals with evidence-based opinions on the subject.
Conclusion
SGLT2 inhibitors have relatively safe profiles and can efficiently decrease HbA1c as well as fasting and postprandial glucose levels. Furthermore, SGLT2 inhibitors administrations are not associated with significant hypoglycemic episodes or weight gain. Thus, combination of SGLT2 inhibitors and other less harmful anti-diabetic medicines could be considered if there is no any contraindication."

Due to the loss of the function of the insulin, the metabolism is disturbed. . It is needed to consider the effects of inflammation aging and the oxidative stress on the diabetes mellitus. Therefore this review has dealt with this particular issue in great detail. The predominant aim of this review was to evaluate the effects of inflammation aging and oxidative stress on the T2DM. It was achieved through correlating and comparing the studies of different researchers. This review article has reviewed this topic in great detail considering the different researches related to the inflammation aging, oxidative stress and their impact on the diabetes mellitus."

abstract = "Diabetes is a common metabolic disorder associated to elevated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality that is not explained by hyperglycemia or traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking or hypercholesterolemia. Intensive glycemic control with insulin that achieves near-normal glycemia does not reduce significantly macrovascular complications compared with conventional glycemic control. Cardiovascular disease continues to develop in patients with diabetes despite adequate glycemic control. In contrast, intensive control with metformin (leading to insulin resistance improvement) reduces diabetes complications, including cardiovascular events, suggesting that enhancement of insulin sensitivity rather than plasma glucose level has a major role improving diabetes outcomes. Accordingly, insulin resistance estimated by glucose tolerance tests is better predictor of future cardiovascular events than fasting glucose level in nondiabetic individuals. Insulin resistance precedes for decades the clinical onset of type 2 diabetes and deteriorates metabolic control of type 1 diabetes. Numerous investigations including cross-sectional and prospective studies, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews provide compelling evidence that insulin resistance by itself is a cardiovascular risk factor in a variety of population groups, including the general population and patients with diabetes. Several estimations of insulin resistance have been consistently associated with elevated rate of cardiovascular events independently of other cardiovascular risk factors and diabetes status. The clinical expression of insulin resistance (the metabolic syndrome or any of its components including obesity, hyperinsulinemia, hypertension, and dyslipemia) has been related to cardiovascular disease as well. An estimation conducted by the Archimedes model confirms that insulin resistance is the most important single cause of coronary artery disease."

abstract = "Aim
The two-way relationship between diabetes mellitus and periodontitis has been extensively studied with various interconnected biomarkers sharing a link. Soluble Tumour Necrosis Factor-like Weak inducer of apoptosis (sTWEAK) is gaining attention as an important mediator in chronic inflammatory diseases. Thus, the aim of this study was to detect, estimate and compare the levels of sTWEAK in the serum of health, chronic periodontitis (CP), and CP with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Materials and methods
Forty-five participants between 18 and 65 years were divided into groups of 15 each as Group 1: healthy, Group 2: CP, and Group 3: CP + T2DM. Clinical periodontal parameters and glycemic status were assessed. sTWEAK in serum was estimated using a commercially available ELISA kit. The data was statistically analyzed.
Results
sTWEAK was detected in all participants. Significant differences were observed between the groups for sTWEAK; highest in health, lower in CP and lowest in CP + T2DM. In the diseased groups, the clinical and glycemic parameters correlated positively with each other, whereas sTWEAK correlated negatively with each of the parameters.
Conclusion
The literature reports lower concentrations of systemic sTWEAK in T2DM which may be comparable to our observations in CP + T2DM when compared to health and its negative correlation with all the parameters suggesting an association with both clinical periodontal parameters and glycemic levels. However, serum sTWEAK levels may not be necessarily elevated in periodontitis as previously reported, and hence has the potential to be studied extensively for clarification with its association with T2DM."

Therefore, the study aims to identify the microbiological profile and the potential risk factors among diabetic and non-diabetic foot ulcer patients. A prospective cross sectional study was carried out among 183 ulcer patients from diabetic foot clinic and wound dressing clinic at the public health hospital, Guyana. A total of 254 bacteria were isolated from the study with an average of 1.4 organism per lesion. Gram negative bacteria (63.0%) were prevalent than gram positive bacteria (37.0%) in this study. Among DF patients, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.8%) was the most common isolate followed by Escherichia coli (13.9%) among gram negative group. Were as MRSA (12.1%) followed by MSSA (7.9%) dominated among gram positive group in diabetic foot patients. Almost 42.1% (95% CI 34.8–49.6) of the infections were caused by poly-microbial. Interestingly, a stepwise logistic regression model determined increasing age and lack of health education as independent risk factor identified for acquiring an MDR wound infection (OR = 1.1; p ≥ 0.05; 95% CI 1.0–1.1). Mild, moderate and severe infection among MDR and NMDR patients were recorded as 45.3% (95% CI 32.8–58.3), 26.5% (95% CI 16.3–39.1), 28.1% (95% CI 17.6–40.8) and 51.3% (95% CI 41.9–60.5), 32.8% (95% CI 24.4–42.0), 16.0% (95% CI 9.9–23.8).

Current monitoring practices fail to diagnose patients with post-transplant hyperglycaemia and tend to delay initiation of treatment, which potentially results in adverse graft and morbidity outcomes. This real-world study set out to assess the impact on insulin resistance indices of a new clinical pathway for diagnosis and treatment of hyperglycaemia following renal transplantation.
Methods
A hundred and forty-seven adult renal transplant recipients, without pre-existing diabetes, from a single centre were included. Patients transplanted between January 2008 to September 2015 formed the historical cohort. Patients transplanted between October 2015 and February 2018 were subject to a new clinical pathway - if they had fasting blood sugar levels more than 7 mmol/L or random blood glucose levels more than 11.1 mmol/L, they had early introduction of oral therapy, using the DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin.
Results
In the historical cohort, 19.8% were diagnosed with PTDM, compared to 46.3% in the protocol cohort. Amongst patients with PTDM, there was a significant difference in HOMA-IR (p = 0.02) between the historical cohort (median HOMA-IR 3.33) and the protocol cohort (median HOMA-IR 2.21). There was a significant difference at each time point (0,1,2-h measurements) of blood glucose levels form oral glucose tolerance testing between patients with and without PTDM in the historical cohort (p < 0.001), but no difference between patients in the protocol cohort.
Conclusion
Detection of PTDM was higher with the new clinical pathway. Early treatment of hyperglycaemia resulted in better insulin resistance scores. Larger prospective controlled studies focussing on early detection and management of PTDM with linagliptin are warranted."

Diet has an important role in the management of chronic diseases. This study aimed to investigate the association of adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components.
Methods
This cross-sectional study was performed on 396 Iranian adults, aged ≥18 years. A 147-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to assess dietary intakes of participants. Fasting blood sample was obtained to quantify glycemic indicators and lipid profile. Metabolic syndrome was defined based on the guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III).
Results
Mean age of study participants was 38.22 ± 9.58 years. A significant inverse association was observed between adherence to DASH diet and odds of MetS (OR: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.14, 0.54); such that after adjusting for energy intake, socioeconomic status and body mass index (BMI), participants in the highest tertile of DASH diet scores were 49% less likely to have MetS (OR: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.14–0.54). Furthermore, adherence to DASH diet was inversely associated with elevated blood pressure (OR: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.05–0.29), high serum triglyceride (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.28–1.00) and low serum HDL-C (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.25–1.01). However, this association was marginally significant for triglyceride and HDL-C. No significant association was found between adherence to DASH diet and abdominal obesity.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of death among people with diabetes, however, despite the increasing incidence of CVD, there are few tools for evaluating Cardiovascular Risk (CVR) in the population of patients with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), with the existing ones diverging in the stratification of risk and in the suggestions for therapeutic conduct.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was carried out with 104 participants diagnosed with T1D, aged 18–40, attending specialized services. The Steno Type 1 Risk Engine and the Cardiovascular Risk Stratification Calculator (CRSC) were used to assess the risk of a cardiovascular event over a 10-year period.
Findings
Of the total sample selected, 62% were female, with a median age of 32 years (IQ 24; 43). There was a large difference between the stratification of CVR between the calculators, and 65.82% of the patients classified as low risk for CVD according to the Steno were identified as intermediate (30, 38.00%) and high risk (35.44%) by the CRSC. The analysis also highlighted a great difference in eligibility for statin use according to the risk stratification of the tools.
Conclusion
The CRSC and Steno tools evaluated and stratified the CVR of the same population with T1D, with there being divergence of the results. It was found that the CRSC tool classified the majority of the sample as high risk. Due to this result, the eligibility to use statins, which is one of the applications of these tools, showed great differences, with the Steno tool presenting less aggressive provisions regarding the prescription of statins in patients with type 1 DM."

The present study aimed to compare the clinical characteristics of patients with fibrocalculous pancreatic diabetes (FCPD) and those with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to identify the characteristics distinctive of FCPD.
Methods
A total of 133 patients with FCPD were compared with 665 patients with T2DM matched for duration of diabetes. Biochemical parameters and microvascular and macrovascular complications were assessed in all patients. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to study the determinants of microvascular and macrovascular complications in both groups.
Results
The mean duration of diabetes was 4.42 ± 5.65 years in the FCPD group and 4.51 ± 3.88 years in the T2DM group. FCPD participants were significantly younger at diagnosis and leaner than patients with T2DM. The FCPD group had higher fasting and postprandial glucose and HbA1c levels than the T2DM group. The FCPD group had significantly lower triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, serum total calcium, hemoglobin, and serum creatinine values than the T2DM group. The prevalence of coronary artery disease, stroke, and retinopathy was significantly higher in the T2DM patients while the prevalence of distal symmetric polyneuropathy was significantly lower. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, duration of diabetes and HbA1c (OR = 1.17, P = 0 0.04) in FCPD patients and age (OR = 1.04, P < 0 0.001), duration of diabetes (OR = 1.17, P < 0 0.001) and HbA1c (OR = 1.28, P < 0.001) in T2DM patients were associated with microvascular complications.

abstract = "Aims.
Several epidemiological studies have indicated that elevated blood pressure (BP) is associated with the surfeit of body weight. Body fat accumulation is considered as be a significant factor contributing to the nexus between obesity and hypertension. Two of the most common indicators used to characterize the associations of BP are body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC). This study was aimed to describe the differences in some characteristics among people aged 20 and above in three communes of a district in Vietnam and analyze the correlation between BMI and WC, and BP.
Materials and methods
We conducted a survey with a cross-sectional design of 734 subjects in three communes in Chiem Hoa district of the Vietnam northern mountainous region.
Results
It was found that except for BMI, there were significant differences in some physical characteristics between genders (p < 0.05). Particularly, the effects on Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) or Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) of WC were more significant than that of BMI in genders. The impacts of WC on SBP as well as DBP were also stronger than that of BMI in age groups with the cut-off point 60 than BMI.
Conclusions
This study provides the science evidence in support of public and preventive health interventions to the locals residing in studied area. We recommend the existing correlations in subjects belonging to different ethnicities and continents."

Diabetes and periodontitis are non-transmissible chronic disorders that exhibit a mutual relationship. A study was made to evaluate the risk of prediabetes and periodontal disease, and to explore the association between them.
Methods
A descriptive cross-sectional study was made of 186 individuals over 18 years of age, without prediabetes or diabetes, or cognitive impairment. Subjects undergoing dental treatment and pregnant women were excluded. Prediabetes risk was assessed based on the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC), and the individual risk of development and/or progression of periodontal disease was explored with a periodontal disease risk questionnaire.
Results
A total of 135 gingival risk questionnaires and 142 FINDRISC questionnaires were correctly completed. The proportion of subjects with a low, moderate and high risk of periodontal disease was 60.36%, 38.74% and 0.9%, respectively. With regard to the FINDRISC, the proportion of individuals with low, slightly increased, moderately increased and high risk of prediabetes was 54.4%, 32.8%, 8%, and 4.8%, respectively. A significant linear correlation between the two scores was observed (r = 0.3659, p < 0.0005). The variables associated with a slightly increased risk of prediabetes were age, overweight and smoking, while the variables associated with a moderately increased or high risk were age 40–65 years, tooth loss, overweight and smoking.
Conclusions
These questionnaires may be of benefit to patients and can contribute to develop a chronic care model characterized by collaboration among different healthcare professionals."

The present study aimed to determine the status of diabetes distress and its clinical determinants in type II diabetes patients.
Methods
This descriptive-analytical study was performed on 220 patients with t diabetes referred to Diabetes Clinic of Imam Khomeini Hospital in Ardabil, Iran. The samples were selected using convenience sampling method. Data collection tools included demographic and disease form and Diabetes Mellitus Scale (DDS). Data analysis was performed using SPSS software version 22 via descriptive (frequency, mean, standard deviation) and inferential statistics (compare means, Pearson correlation coefficient and stepwise multiple regression).
Results
The average duration of diabetes was 7.64 (SD = 4.68) years. 63.7% of the patients had moderate to severe diabetes-related distress. Emotional burden dimension had the highest score among the subscales of diabetes distress. In addition, there was a correlation between positive family history (p = 0.017), duration of diabetes (p = 0.028) and type of treatment (p = 0.47) and diabetes distress. HemoglobinA1C levels, body mass index and triglyceride were the major predictors of diabetes distress.
Conclusions
Considering the high prevalence of diabetes distress in patients with type II diabetes, it seems that paying attention to clinical predictors of distress and screening of patients with diabetes is a reasonable and accessible method for health care providers and patients to improve their disease management."

Psoriasis is an immune-mediated chronic inflammatory skin disease with unknown etiology. Current findings demonstrate that psoriatic patients are at higher risk of other systemic disorders such as diabetes mellitus. The present study was conducted to evaluate the association between psoriasis and diabetes mellitus.
Method
The current study was conducted based on preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Using MeSH keywords we searched online databases of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EBSCO and Google scholar search engine and the reference list of the retrieved articles until June 2018. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using Cochran's Q test and I2 index and the random effects model was used to estimate Odds Ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Data were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software version 2.
Results
Analysis of 38 eligible studies involving 922870 cases and 12808071 controls suggested the estimated OR to be 1.69 (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.51–1.89; P < 0.001).

abstract = "Background
Diabetes is rising at an alarming rate in India and the national capital forms a significant part of the nation's diabetic population. The metabolic disorder is no more a disease specific to the rich countries but has also markedly spread its roots in middle-income countries.
Objective
To ascertain the prevalence of associated co-morbidities in the diabetic population of Delhi, a metropolitan city in India. Moreover, this study was conducted to help with adding information to the limited shreds of evidence of diabetes prevalence in Delhi along with the usually preferred therapies.
Materials and methods
A cross-sectional, observational, survey-based study was conducted on people (n = 798) of different age groups (18 years and above) belonging to different regions of Delhi. All subjects were enrolled after obtaining oral consent. Detailed information about clinical, demographic and metabolic profiles was obtained with the help of a pre-structured, open-ended questionnaire. The data were analyzed, and the correlation between diabetes and several other fields was drawn.
Results
Out of the 798 diabetic patients 458 (57.39%) were males and 340 (42.60%) were females. The presence of diabetes was higher in the age group of 50–60 years irrespective of the gender.
Co-morbidities
54.13% of patients suffered with additional co-morbidities which is significantly high. The associated co-morbidities found in the survey included Hypertension, Hypothyroidism, Dyslipidemia, Obesity, Coronary Artery Diseases etc. About 30.57% of patients suffered from hypertension making it the most commonly associated co-morbidity. The other diseases included hypothyroidism (11.52%), Dyslipidemia (10.27%), Obesity (9.27%) etc.
Medication
Majority of patients i.e about 60.65% received oral hypoglycemic agents (including patients receiving both insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents). About 19.92% of patients were prescribed with insulin. 14.16% of patients were found to be following diet control and yoga with about 3.13% more females the males. A small percentage of patients (5.25%) were also following alternative systems (Ayurvedic/Unani/Homeopathic) of treatment. Overall, amongst oral hypoglycemic agents, the combination of metformin and DPP4 inhibitors (Vildagliptin, Sitagliptin) was being prescribed majorly i.e 16.41%.
Conclusion
The number of diabetic population is high in Delhi. It was evident that a significant percentage of diabetic patients suffered from additional diseases that may lead to worsening of the health conditions. Thus, there is an urgent need to educate and spread awareness amongst the masses about the potential benefits of lifestyle modifications like the incorporation of a healthy diet and physical activities. Additionally, continuous and regular tests should be taken to avoid further complications."

Design
and Setting: Case control study including 82 participants (41 cases and 41 controls) from Family Medicine Clinic, Cairo University Hospitals.
Method
Participants fulfilling the inclusion criteria were allocated into two groups, diabetes and control groups. History was taken, examination was done, and blood sample was withdrawn for analysis of Vitamin D levels and HBA1C. From the diabetic group only, serum creatinine was assessed and urine sample was collected for microalbuminuria. The results were analyzed using SPSS program version 21.
Results
Vitamin D level was lower in the diabetic group compared to control (65.5% and 56.1%). Vitamin D level was inversely proportionate to HbA1c levels in the diabetic patients (p value 0.000 & r −0.482), as well as to the A/C ratio (p value 0.01 & r −0.396).

Dyslipidemia is linked to chronic inflammation, which in return leads to a set of chronic disorders. Omega-3 fatty acids have been reported to reduce inflammation. Furthermore, Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin which has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Vitamin E and omega-3 fatty acids co-supplementations may be more effective than the single supplementation in control dyslipidemia. Therefore, we designed and conducted the current systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effect of co-supplementation of vitamin E and omega-3 fatty acids on the lipid profile.
Methods
A comprehensive search for studies published between January 1990 and July 2018 was performed. The initial search extracted 3015 potentially relevant articles. After studying these publications, 9 RCTs were potentially eligible and retrieved in full text.
Results
The meta-analysis indicate that on total cholesterol, HDL, LDL and triglyceride individually did not show any significant difference between intervention and control groups, but vitamin E an omega-3 fatty acids co-supplementations significantly reduce VLDL levels.
Conclusions
Based on the available evidence, omega-3 fatty acid and vitamin E co-supplementation can reduce VLDL, although its effect on other lipid profile parameters requires more well-designed studies."

Fasting lipid profile does not necessarily illustrate the exact lipid dynamic in 24 h as human spends most of their time in postprandial state. Postprandial triglyceride (TG) has been reported to have advantages compared to fasting TG in terms of practicality and ability to predict cardiovascular events. This study aims to assess the determinant of postprandial TG in healthy young adults.
Methods
This is a quasy-experimental study that involved 200 healthy young adults. This study compared fasting with postprandial TG and analyzed the relationship between postprandial TG with various demographic and metabolic parameters after ingestion of standardized high fat liquid meal.
Result
There was an upward trend from fasting TG to 2 h postprandial TG and 4 h postprandial TG. There was strong correlation between fasting TG and 2 h postprandial TG with 4 h postprandial TG (r = 0.731; p < 0.0001 dan r = 0.669; p < 0.0001, respectively). Whereas body mass index (BMI) and age showed weak correlation with 4 h postprandial TG (r = 0.141; p < 0.0001 dan r = 0.0747; p < 0.0001), fasting TG was the strongest predictor of 4 h postprandial TG (r = 0.669, B = 1.722 (95% CI 1.552 to 1.892), p < 0.0001).
Conclusion
Fasting TG was the strongest determinant of 4 h postprandial TG in healthy young adults. We also observed strong correlation between 4 h postprandial TG and fasting TG. Hence, 4 h postprandial TG might potentially replaced fasting TG when measurement of fasting TG is not feasible."

The aim was to estimate the burden of macro- and micro-vascular complications on hospitalisation and healthcare cost among people with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Bangladesh.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was carried out in 2017. A total of 1253 patients were recruited from six hospitals. Information related to cost and complications of type 2 diabetes were collected. Multiple logistic and non-parametric regression analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of complications on hospitalisation and average annual cost.
Results
Overall, 63.4% of the participants had complications of which 14.8% and 20.7% had macro- and micro-vascular complications respectively and 27.9% had both. Use of insulin, presence of both hypertension and dyslipidaemia, coronary artery diseases, stroke, nephropathy, and retinopathy were significantly associated with hospitalisation. Further, use of oral hypoglycaemic agent with a combination of insulin, presence of coronary artery diseases, stroke, nephropathy, and retinopathy increased the average annual cost.
Conclusion
The prevalence of macro- and micro-vascular complications were very high in Bangladesh and majority of them are key drivers for hospitalisation and increased healthcare cost. An improvement of primary prevention strategy for complications is urgently needed which in turn will reduce the long-term healthcare cost for type 2 diabetes in Bangladesh."

We identified 47 articles overall. Telemedicine impact was reported as positive in articles addressing the following components of patient self-management: adherence to blood glucose monitoring, day-to-day decision-making related to self-care, and adherence with medications. The most commonly reported clinical outcome was HbA1c level. Few or no studies evaluated impact on long term clinical outcomes such as blindness, amputation, cardiovascular events, development of chronic kidney disease, or mortality.
Discussion
This scoping review provides important information about studies conducted in the United States evaluating the impact of telemedicine on patient self-management and on clinical outcomes in patients with DM.
Conclusions
Results suggest that telemedicine has a positive impact on self-management processes and on HbA1c levels. However, future evaluative reviews are necessary to confirm and quantitate the impact of telemedicine on self-management processes and primary studies are necessary to evaluate its impact on long term clinical outcomes."

This study has been conducted with the aim of determining the relationship between health literacy, knowledge and self-care behaviors to take care of the diabetic foot in low-income individuals, based on the extended parallel process model (EPPM).
Methods
This cross-sectional study was conducted on 400 patients with type II diabetes referred to the Diabetes Clinic, using a random sampling method and using standard questionnaires. In this study, the constructs of knowledge, EPPM (perceived sensitivity, perceived severity, response efficacy, self-efficacy), and health literacy were significantly related to self-care behaviors (p < 0.05).
Results
Based on the linear regression results, the constructs of knowledge, health literacy, and constructs of EPPM were able to account for 43% of the variance to perform diabetic foot self-care behaviors. The maximum impact was related to the constructs of health literacy and self-efficacy (p < 0.001).
Conclusion
Based on these results, levels of knowledge and health literacy of patients were very poor overall, and the self-care behaviors were not appropriate. On the other hand, considering the great impact of health literacy in performing self-care behaviors, it is suggested that educational courses be held in this regard and proper strategies are employed to enhance the health literacy of diabetic patients."

Adipokines are associated with several oxidative stress-related diseases and pathologic conditions. We aimed to assess the association between antioxidants and adipokines in obese adults.
Methods and Materials
In this cross-sectional study, a total of 160 obese women were included. Body composition and anthropometric characteristics were measured. Dietary intakes were assessed by 3-day, 24-h dietary recall. Blood samples were obtained following an overnight fasting. Serum concentrations of adipokines including progranulin, retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) and Angiopoietin-related growth factor 6 (ANGPTL6) was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. ANCOVA and the linear regression model analysis was performed to assess the relationship between Progranulin, RBP4, AnGPTL6, and antioxidants.
Results
Mean age of included women was 39.31 ± 12.10. Mean and standard deviation for BMI was 35.05 ± 4.26 in this obese population. There was a positive significant association between ANGPTL6 and vitamin D intake (p < 0.001). Also, there was a marginal association between RBP4 and vitamin A (p = 0.063) intake, but after adjustment age, and fat mass, we found a significant association (p = 0.008). However, the associations between dietary antioxidants, progranulin, and ANGPTL6 were not statistically significant.
Conclusions
ANGPTL6 and RBP4 levels directly associated with dietary vitamins D and A intake, respectively. But, according to the results, the association between ANGPTL6 and vitamin D was bidirectional. The suggested associations probably can be useful in the development of interventional studies for management of chronic diseases."

Alteration in the metabolism of magnesium have an influence on different metabolic and signaling pathways involved in development of diabetes and its progression. Reduced magnesium level was associated with diabetes related complications. The aim of this study is to determine the serum levels of magnesium in diabetic patients having different complications and the association of magnesium with status of glycemic control.
Materials and methods
This study was conducted among 88 type 2 diabetic patients, subdivided into two groups according to diabetic complications (with complications n = 55; without complications n = 33) and biochemical variables were measured.
Results
The serum magnesium level was decreased in diabetic patients having any complications (P = 0.039) or independent complication (nephropathy, P = 0.437; retinopathy, P = 0.038; neuropathy, P = 0.012 and macrovascular complication, P = 0.039), also decrease with increase in number of diabetic complications.

Method
Study was designed as cross-sectional and conducted in a tertiary Hospital diabetes unit. 296 type diabetic patients and 151 healthy controls was included to the study. Venous samples were collected into plain tubes after overnight fasting. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was measured by radioimmunoassay technique. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 15.0.
Results
25-Hydroxyvitamin D levels were similar between patients with type 1 diabetes (22, 9 ± 17, 4 ng/ml) and controls (24, 5 ± 19, 3 ng/ml) (p = 0,382). Most of the participants have 25-Hydroxyvitamin D deficiency. As shown in Table 2 serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D level was not associated with most of the biochemical or anthropometric parameters.
Conclusion
As a result there were no difference between type 1 diabetics and healthy controls according to their vitamin D levels. Further studies with a larger sample of patients will improve our understanding of the relation of vitamin D and diabetes."

To assess the ability of leptin, adiponectin and leptin: adiponectin ratio (LAR) to discriminate apparently healthy subjects with metabolic syndrome in Southwest Nigeria.
Methods
One hundred and twenty three subjects with metabolic syndrome (cases) were age matched with 123 subjects without metabolic syndrome. The serum adiponectin and leptin levels were measured using standard procedures. The ability of serum adiponectin, leptin and LAR to discriminate metabolic syndrome and its components were determined using the receiver operating curve and linear regression.
Results
The median age of the cases (49 IQR 42, 56 years) was not significantly different from the controls (48 IQR 39, 56 years) p = 0.252. The adiponectin levels was reduced with increasing number of the components of metabolic syndrome from 11.6 (IQR 9.6, 13.5) among subjects without any component of metabolic syndrome to 6.5 (IQR 5.7, 7.7) in subjects with more than three components of metabolic syndrome. For leptin and LAR, the values increased with increasing components (p < 0.001). LAR (AUC 0.960) discriminated metabolic syndrome better than adiponectin (AUC 0.865) and leptin (AUC = 0.918) in males and females (LAR AUC = 0.966, adiponectin AUC = 0.888, leptin AUC = 0.929).

To identify the demographic and clinical characteristics of Dominican adults admitted to a diabetic foot clinic and compare these characteristics by sex to better characterize and understand the severity of diabetes in the Dominican Republic.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective medical chart review of Dominican adults admitted to the National Institute of Diabetes, Endocrinology, and Nutrition's (INDEN) diabetic foot clinic between January 1st, 2015 and December 31st, 2015. We generated descriptive statistics and compared results by sex.
Results
We assessed 447 medical charts of patients admitted in 2015. More men visited the clinic than women (65% vs. 35%). The average duration of diabetes was 14.4 ± 8.9 years. Abscess was the most common foot problem (74% in men, 68% in women, p = 0.164). A slightly smaller proportion of men received amputations than women (46% vs. 51%, p = 0.390). Women were older (p < 0.001), less educated (p = 0.004), and less likely to be married (p < 0.001).

Conclusion
Implementation of diabetes education programs, introduction of proper foot care, and improved resources for lifestyle management are needed to increase awareness and subsequently decrease diabetes and its negative impact on the health and economy of the Dominican Republic. Our findings suggest that various risk factors and comorbidities important to the development of diabetes may be disproportionately affecting women.

S100A8 and S100A9 are myeloid-related damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) primarily involved in the modulation of innate immune response to cellular injury. This study evaluated the correlation between circulating concentrations of S100A8 and S100A9 proteins with the severity of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).
Methods
T2DM patients with HbA1c levels >7%, fasting blood glucose >126 mg/dl and history of diabetes were included in this study. DR severity was graded based on ETDRS and Gloucestershire classifications. Plasma samples were evaluated for S100A8 and S100A9 levels using ELISA.
Results
In this comparative study, DR patients (n = 89) had increased plasma S100A8 and S100A9 proteins compared to age-matched T2DM controls (n = 28), which was directly related to the severity of DR. Female DR subjects had increased S100A8 expression compared to their male counterparts. Substantial retention of S100A8 and S100A9 production was seen in DR patients above 50 years of age. Duration of T2DM was not found to affect protein levels, however T2DM onset at >50 years old significantly increased S100A8 and S100A9 concentrations.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that systemic circulation levels of S100A8 and S100A9 are correlated with the progression of DR in T2DM patients, indicating their potential role in DR pathogenesis."

Several methods/medicines namely diet control, energy balance, environmental changes, genetic and stem cell therapies, new drugs/chemicals have been extensively studied to enhance the ability to control bodyweight and prevent obesity. Of all the aforementioned methods, green tea, used as a daily beverage, has shown beneficial impacts for the health, especially its anti-obesity effects. Available evidence shows that green tea can interrupt lipid emulsification, reduce adipocyte differentiation, increase thermogenesis, and reduce food intake, thus green tea improves the systemic metabolism and decreases fat mass.

In addition, the mean body mass index (BMI) was 27.47 (95% CI: 25.46–29.48) and the mean waist circumference was 87.94 (95% CI: 84.28–91.60). According the meta-regression results, there were no significant associations between the prevalence of MetS and sample size, year of publication, waist circumference, BMI, and age. One-fourth of Iranian women with PCOS have MetS. Given the overlap between anthropometric and metabolic abnormalities in PCOS and the features of MetS, accurate identification of patients with MetS is important to ensure early diagnosis and subsequent interventions to effectively manage the condition."

This study aims to determine the association between depression with glycemic control (HbA1c) and its complications.
Materials and methods
This was a cross-sectional study that included 514 diabetic patients. The patients were randomly selected from among all type 2 diabetes patients referred to health and medical centers in Khorramabad town (Iran). Two questionnaires used for data collection. The first questionnaire included demographic information, diabetes and its complications and the second questionnaire was Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) which was used to assess depression. The stata software version 14 was used for data analysis. Then, for evaluate the association between depression with glycemic contol and its complications, Univariate and multiple logistic regression analysis were employed.
Results
The prevalence of depression in diabetic patients under study was 46.3% and for female and male was 49.6 and 36.8%; respectively. The results showed that 48.6% of diabetic patients did not have appropriate glycemic control status (HbA1c > 8). There was no significant association between glycemic control expressed as HbA1c levels and depression (OR: 1.11, 95% CI: 0.87–1.57). By contrast, sex (OR: 2.03, CI 95%: 1.03–3.99), residence (OR: 1.92, 95% CI: 1.28–2.91) and sexual complications (OR: 5.54, 95% CI: 1.07–27.87) have a significant statistical association with depression.

the present work was carried on 400 patients with T2DM. History taking, physical examination, laboratory investigations (with special emphasis on glycemic profile and lipid profile parameters) were done for every patient. Assessment of anxiety and depression using the HADS score and assessment of mild cognitive impairment using MoCA score were done.
Results
76% of studied patients had depression of varying degrees while 56.8% of studied patients had MCI. Decreased level of HDL-cholesterol and increased HADS anxiety score were significant predictors of depression. On the other hand, increased level of total cholesterol, decreased level of HDL-cholesterol, increased HADS depression score and decreased MoCA score were significant predictors of anxiety. HDL-cholesterol HADS anxiety score, FBG, and duration of DM were the significant predictors of MCI.
Conclusion
Increased level of total cholesterol, decreased level of HDL-cholesterol, increased HADS depression score and decreased MoCA score were significant predictors of anxiety. HDL-cholesterol, HADS anxiety score, FBG, and duration of DM were the significant predictors of MCI."

To assess serum leptin in diabetic nephropathy male patients from Gaza Strip.
Materials and methods
This case-control study comprised 132 type 2 diabetic patients and 44 non-diabetic controls. The diabetic patients were classified into three groups; 44 normoalbuminurics, 44 microalbuminurics and 44 macroalbuminurics. Data were obtained from questionnaire interview, and biochemical analysis of blood and urine samples. Patients and controls were matched for age and body mass index (BMI).
Results
Serum leptin was significantly higher in micro- and macro-albuminuric patients (14.6 ± 11.7 and 15.6 ± 13.5 ng/ml) than controls and normoalbuminurics (5.9 ± 4.0 and 8.1 ± 7.6 ng/ml) with P < 0.05. In general, serum glucose, urea, createnine, cholesterol, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), urinary albumin and albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) were increased in diabetic groups compared to non-diabetics, and reaching their maximum increase in macroalbuminurics whereas high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), urinary creatinine and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were decreased reaching its maximum decrease in macroalbuminurics. Serum leptin showed significant positive correlations with diabetes duration (r = 0.188, P = 0.020), glucose (r = 0.298, P < 0.001), cholesterol (r = 0.323, P < 0.001), triglycerides (r = 0.361, P < 0.001), LDL-C (r = 0.248, P = 0.001) and urinary albumin (r = 0.256, P = 0.001) whereas negative significant correlations were found with HDL-C (r = −0.313, P < 0.001) and urinary creatinine (r = −0.202, P = 0.007).
Conclusion
The comitant raise of serum leptin with urinary albumin combined with decrease in GFR makes leptin eligible candidate as a biomarker for progression towards diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetes."

Recently, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics have been emphasized in dealing with chronic diseases of which Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one. This present study was conducted to correlate the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of out-patient type 2 diabetic adults with their body mass index (BMI).
Methodology
This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Out-patients Diabetic clinic of University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital Ituku-Ozalla, Enugu Nigeria. A total of 370 subjects were purposively selected from the 2888 annual average attendances and examined with questionnaire and anthropometry. Information on their demographic and socioeconomic characteristics was correlated with their body mass index.
Result
The results indicated that there were more (59%) urban diabetics than rural (25.7%) diabetics, many (65.7%) were within the age range of 41–60years, more (64.9%) females than males (35.1%), mainly (86.2%) married and of Christian religion (94.1%) and Igbo ethnicity (95.9%). The majority (91.1%) were of a monogamous family type with 55.4% from average sized (4-6persons) families. More than 1/3 (34.1%) had tertiary education, mainly (43%) civil servants, and 45.1% earning above 137.21 US Dollar per month. Most (69%) of the diabetics were over-weight, a trend of both under-nutrition (1.1%), and over-nutrition (68.7%) with mean BMI value of 27.19 kg/m2 was also observed. BMI had slight negative association with age, sex, and occupation and positive association with religion, ethnicity, marital status and level of education.

Prolactin plays a significant role in lactation and prolactin levels are increasing physiologically in pregnancy and breastfeeding period. There might be different mechanisms during breastfeeding between prolactin and insülin levels. In order to highlighten this mechanisms we compared the plasma levels of glucose, insülin, prolactin, C-peptid in basal situations and after taking 75 gr carbonhydrate, 20 gr protein, 23 gr fat in breastfeeding and in non lactating women.
Material and methods
Participiants and measurements: The study population included 12 breastfeeding women and 11 healthy non lactating women as a control group. We collected information on age, history of gestational diabetes mellitus, family history of diabetes mellitus, natality, the symptoms of hypoglycemia. Weight, height and waist circumference were measured and body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m2).
Results
Prolactin was inversely correlated with HbA1c and 2. hour C peptide (p=0.005, r=−0.564; p=0.008, r=−0.539). Prolactin was not significantly correlated with HOMA-IR, HOMA-IS, AUC-I or AUC-G. Prolactin levels were higher in breastfeeding women (median:34.98 μg/L) than in non lactating women (median:12.21 μg/L, p<0.001). There was a significant association between age and fasting glucose (p=0.018, r=−0.665), 2. hour glucose (p=0.049, r=0.578) in breastfeeding women.
Discussion
In our study, we displayed prolactin was inversely correlated with HbA1c and 2. hour C peptide. Some studies in the past demonstrated that higher prolactin levels had importantly lower prevelance of type 2 diabetes. Our findings supported this situation."

Albuminuria is an established marker for endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular risk in diabetes and prediabetes. So we aimed to explore the prevalence of albuminuria (microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria) in patients with type2 diabetes mellitus (DM) in the Palestinian community and to determine the association between albuminuria and other health care and biochemical indicators.
Materials and methods
A cross-sectional study was carried out at private health care center. A total of 550 diabetic patients aged 35 years and above with type 2 diabetes mellitus who attended the clinic from May 2017 through February 2018 were included. Socio-demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were obtained from the medical records of patients. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, version 23).
Results
Out of the 550 patients recruited, the mean age and duration of diabetes were 57.8 years and 9.5 years, respectively. Approximately 62% were being managed by oral hypoglycemic agents alone, 4.3% by insulin alone, 31.7% were on a combination of oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin and slightly less than 2% were on dietary measures alone. The mean value for HbA1c was 7.71%. The overall prevalence of albuminuria among participants was found to be 34.6%; microalbuminuria (29.3%) and macroalbuminuria (5.3%).
Conclusion
Albuminuria is highly prevalent among Palestinian population with type 2 diabetes. This calls for early and universal screening of urinary albumin. There is also an urgent need for measures that target tight glycemic and optimal blood pressure control and the use of renin-angiotensin system blockade."

Obesity is associated with metabolic dysfunction and over nutrition. Increased body mass index and obesity are strongly amalgamated with changes in the physiological function of adipose tissue, leading to altered secretion of adipocytokines, inflammatory mediators release as well as chronic inflammation and insulin resistance. The purposes of this study were to review the evidence of how obesity and inflammation may lead to insulin resistance and cancer.
Summary
Recent findings suggested that increased level of inflammatory mediators in obesity, plays an introductory and cabalistic role in the development of different types of inflammatory disorders including type 2 diabetes mellitus. Link between elevated body mass index and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Several of the factors−such as increased levels of leptin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, decreased levels of adiponectin, insulin resistance, chronic inflammation etc. consequently result in carcinogenesis and carcinogenic progression too.
Conclusion
This review summarizes how cytokine production in adipose tissue of obese subject creates a chronic inflammatory environment that favors tumor cell motility and invasion to enhance the metastatic potential of tumor cells. High levels of cytokine in the circulation of affected individuals have been associated with a significantly worse outcome. This article also reconnoiters the mechanisms that link obesity to numerous disorders such as inflammation, diabetes, cancers and most specifically combine these processes in a single image. Understanding these mechanisms may assist to understand the consequences of obesity."

abstract = "Background
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin (Ang-2) systems have a central role in vasculogenesis and neoangiogenesis during glomerular development. disruption, their levels are associated with alterations in the glomerular filtration barrier and proteinuria as in diabetic nephropathy. Aim of this study to assess the validity of blood Ang-2 and VEGF as biomarkers for early detection of diabetic nephropathy as well as to study the relation between them and inflammation in diabetic nephropathy patients.
Subjects and methods
Cross-sectional study included 180 diabetic nephropathy patients. Patients were classified to non-albuminuric, microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria patients. Patients with macroalbuminuria complicated to renal impairment and ESRD on top of diabetic nephropathy. Ang-2 and VEGF were measured beside urinary albumin creatinine ratio (UACR).
Results
Significant increase of Ang-2 and VEGF levels among patients with normoalbuminuric state compared to control but there is no significant difference of UACR between both groups. Ang-2 and VEGF concentrations were significantly higher in patients with microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria compared to healthy. Ang-2 and VEGF levels increase with the progression of albuminuria. There were significant positive correlation between CRP and Ang-2 in addition to VEGF. Significant negative correlation between eGFR, Ang-2 and VEGF.
Conclusion
VEGF and Ang-2 were significantly elevated in diabetic nephropathy patients without albuminuria, their levels steadily increase with the progress of albuminuria, So can use them as markers for diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy onset and progression specially in patients without an increase in albumin excretion."

Vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D or 25OHD) has a key role in the pathogenesis of several chronic disorders. Vitamin D deficiency is a common global public health problem. We aimed to evaluate the risk factors associated with vitamin D deficiency using a decision tree algorithm.
Methods
A total of 988 adolescent girls, aged 12–18 years old, were recruited to the study. Demographic characteristics, serum biochemical factors, all blood count parameters and trace elements such as Zinc, Copper, Calcium and SOD were measured. Serum levels of vitamin D below 20 ng/ml were considered to be deficiency. 70% of these girls (618 cases) were randomly allocated to a training dataset for the constructing of the decision-tree. The remaining 30% (285 cases) were used as the testing dataset to evaluate the performance of decision-tree. In this model, 14 input variables were included: age, academic attainment of their father, waist circumference, waist to hip ratio, zinc, copper, calcium, SOD, FBG, HDL-C, RBC, MCV, MCHC, HCT. The validation of the model was assessed by constructing a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
Results
The results showed that serum Zn concentration was the most important associated risk factor for vitamin D deficiency. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) values were 79.3%, 64%, 77.8% and 0.72 respectively using the testing dataset.
Conclusions
The results suggest that the serum levels of Zn is an important associated risk factor for identifying subjects with vitamin D deficiency among Iranian adolescent girls."

The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of DKA among type 1 and type 2 patients with diabetes mellitus, who were hospitalized in our Clinic due to DKA, as well as to determine the etiology beyond DKA.
Patients and methods
A cohort of 109 patients with DKA, 17–86 years of age, who were hospitalized in the Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism of our hospital between 2015 and 2017, were included in the study.
Results
Among the 109 patients, 50 (45.9%) had mild DKA, 48 (44.1%) had moderate DKA, whereas 11 patients (10%) had severe DKA. Sixty-five patients (60%) developed DKA as the first manifestation of T1DM, 30 patients (27%) developed DKA in the context of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), mainly due to the co-existence of serious infections, 11 patients (10%) had T1DM, but had omitted their insulin dosages, and 3 patients (3%) developed DKA due to unknown reasons.
Conclusions
Most patients with DKA presented with mild and moderate DKA and only a minority presented with the severe form of the disease. The etiology of DKA was mainly T1DM and less frequent uncontrolled T2DM, usually due to the co-existence of severe infections, while only in a tiny minority, the causes remained unidentifiable."

The primary goal of this study was to determine the best anthropometric predictors for pediatric MetS. For this purpose, 988 high school girls were recruited. Anthropometric indices and biochemical parameters were measured using standard procedures. The adapted MetS for pediatrics, including the IDF, NCEP, and two modified-NCEPs (Cook's and DeFerranti's) were used to establish a diagnosis of MetS. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS and MedCalc softwares. Except for body frame size (r), the values for anthropometric indices were significantly lower in an individual without MetS. Waist to height (WHtR), BMI and hip circumference (HiC) showed the strongest association with the different MetS definitions. For the IDF definition, the highest sensitivity and specificity were observed for HiC (100.0, 85.2) and WHtR (100.0, 84.7); while for the NCEP definition, the r index showed the highest sensitivity (85.0); but low specificity made it inapplicable. For the Cook's definition of MetS, wrist circumference (WrC), HiC, WHtR, BMI and SR had similar sensitivity values with WC (92.9%), and HiC (85.3%) have the highest specificity. WHtR (86.05, 80.5), SR (86.05, 82.7) and HiC (76.7, 87.0) sensitivity and specificity were the best indexes for DeFerranti's criteria. Based on this date, we concluded that HiC and WHtR might be helpful as auxiliary indexes for pediatric MetS definition; however, further studies are required in both genders."

The aim of this study was to describe the frequency of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia, obesity and polycystic ovaries syndrome (PCOS).
Methods
In a cross-sectional study, 333 patients who had one of the certain diagnosis of DM, hyperlipidemia, obesity or PCOS were enrolled. Information about demographics, anthropometric, nutritional habitude, smoking history, medical history and physical activity were recorded. Liver ultrasound examination and routine biochemistry analysis were performed.
Results
Among 333 patients with one of the four above-mentioned diseases. 199 patients (59.8%) had NAFLD. Male were more likely to have NAFLD than female (72.8% vs. 50.8% respectively, P < 0.001). About, 80.7% of patients through 41–50 years age had NAFLD. The frequency of abnormal fasting blood glucose, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), triglyceride, and total cholesterol were significantly higher in patients with NAFLD (P < 0.05). Subjects with NAFLD had a higher body mass index than non-NAFLD (33.6 ± 7.9 kg/m2 vs. 31.1 ± 5.0 kg/m2 respectively, P = 0.002). Patients with DM, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and hypothyroidism were more likely to have NAFLD (P < 0.05). Patients with consumption of supper, high-fat diet, enjoy of eating and smoking were more likely to have NAFLD and patients with fruit and vegetable uptake and physical activity were less likely to have NAFLD (P < 0.05).
Conclusions
As most patients with NAFLD are asymptomatic, employed individuals with higher education levels, with a history of smoking and unhealthy diet along with DM, hyperlipidemia, PCOS and obesity seriously have to be followed and educated for lifestyle modification."

The hepatic ABCA1 is involved in regulation of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) production by affecting the apolipoprotein B trafficking and lipidation of VLDL particles. This protein is involved in protecting the function of pancreatic β-cells and insulin secretion by cholesterol homeostasis. Adipose tissue lipolysis is associated with ABCA1 activity. This transporter is involved in controlling obesity and insulin sensitivity by regulating triglyceride (TG) lipolysis and influencing on adiponectin, visfatin, leptin, and GLUT4 genes expression. The ABCA1 of skeletal muscle cells play a role in increasing the glucose uptake by enhancing the Akt phosphorylation and transferring GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. Abnormal status of ABCA1-regulated phenotypes is observed in metabolic syndrome. This syndrome is associated with the occurrence of many diseases.

Many cases of Poly-Cystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) are overweight and presenting with insulin resistance.
Main objective
was to evaluate the effects of ovarian drilling on the serum levels of Irisin in women with polycystic ovaries.
Study design and setting
Serum Irisin levels were investigated in 100 cases with PCOS before ovarian drilling and 3 months after drilling, and in 80 control cases. Serum Irisin, hormonal profile and HOMA-IR were estimated in PCOS cases before and after ovarian drilling. Statistical analysis was performed by using Statistical Package for Social Scientists (SPSS).
Results
The serum irisin levels in overweight and in normal weight PCOS cases before ovarian drilling were significantly higher as compared with the corresponding control cases. Fasting serum Irisin levels were found to be significantly elevated in PCOS patients before ovarian drilling as compared to the levels after drilling. The serum irisin levels in overweight and in normal weight PCOS cases before ovarian drilling were found to be significantly positively correlated with BMI, insulin levels, and HOMA-IR.
Conclusion
Elevated serum Irisin levels in PCOS may contribute to the development of insulin resistance. Ovarian drilling for polycystic ovaries results in a significant decrease in the serum Irisin levels. The analysis of ROC curves may suggest that serum Irisin may be a valuable biomarker for diagnosis and for monitoring cases with PCOS during treatment."

Diabetes prevalence in HIV is not well characterized for India, despite the high burden of both individual diseases. Epidemiology of insulin resistance (IR): a precursor to diabetes, and its associated risk factors are also poorly understood in Asian Indian people living with HIV (PLHIV). We assessed the prevalence of diabetes and IR in Pune, India and the associated risk factors for IR.
Methods
Cross-sectional analysis of adult (≥18 years) PLHIV receiving care at Byramjee Jeejeebhoy Government Medical College and Sassoon General Hospitals, Pune, India (BJGMC- SGH). Proportions and medians of PLHIV characteristics by diabetes status and IR were described. Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA) index value ≥2 was used to define IR. Line of least squares assessed the relationship between IR and hyperinsulinemia. Association between sociodemographic, clinical factors with IR was determined using logistic regression.
Results
Of 485 enrollees, 47% were men, median age was 40 years (IQR: 35–46), median CD4 counts were 389 cells/mm3 (246–609). Thirty-five percent were centrally obese, 75% were adherent to WHO recommended physical activity guidelines. Prevalence of diabetes, prediabetes, IR were 9%, 16% and 38%, respectively. Twenty-nine percent non-diabetics had IR and it occurred much prior to the threshold for hyperinsulinemia. IR was associated with the use of ART drugs (OR: 6.6, 95% CI: 2.9–15.2 and 5.4, 95% CI: 2.2–13.6 for first- and second line ART respectively) and central obesity (OR:1.9, 95% CI: 1.1–3.4).
Conclusions
One fourth of the study population was diabetic or prediabetic and more than a third had IR. Better understanding of diabetes disease progression in relation to IR and the effect of physical activity on central obesity among Asian Indian PLHIV is mandated."

abstract = "Background
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing recently due to increasing the prevalence of obesity. Insulin resistance (IR) is the mutual pathological cause for both T2DM and NAFLD. Vitamin D acts against IR by its anti-inflammatory and regulation of insulin secretion as pancreatic beta cells express vitamin D receptor (VDR).
Aim
Assessment of relationship between Total vitamin D level and NAFLD a sample of Egyptian patients with and without T2DM.
Methods
The current study included 110 Egyptian subjects. They divided into 4 groups: Group 1: 30 diabetic patients with NAFLD Group 2: 30 diabetic patients without NAFLD Group 3: 30 NAFLD patients without diabetes Group 4: 20 healthy controls. Vitamin D level assessment, AST, ALT, GGT, total cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides, fasting and 2 h post prandial plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, albumin and creatinine calculation of FLI were assessed.
Result
There was a statistical significant decrease in total vitamin D level in T2DM patients with NAFLD than either T2DM or NAFLD only patients.(15.5 ± 7.46 vs 24.4 ± 8.19 and 22.86 ± 9.58 ng/ml respectively) also Total vitamin D level is negatively correlated with age, weight, BMI, WC, total cholesterol, LDL, TG, FPG, HbA1c and FLI.
Conclusion
There is a decrease in total vitamin D in T2DM patients with NAFLD."

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of VDD in Saudi Arabia, revealing the lifestyle and nutritional habits; and assesses the association between VDD, Diabetes Mellitus, and obesity.
Methods
A descriptive, cross-sectional, and correlational design was used in this study. A convenience sampling method of 350 participants participated in the study.
Results
The results revealed that the probability of having vitamin D Deficiency was higher among females (OR = 2.06, p > .05); younger age-whereby with each one year decrease in age there was about 0.03 probability of having Vitamin D Deficiency (B = −0.03; p > .05); individuals with higher incomes (OR = 1.44, p > .05); smokers (OR = 0.08, p > .05); and a lack of exposure to the sun (OR = 8.50; p > .05). In addition, exercise is also a predictor of Vitamin D deficiency (OR = 3.8; p > .05). Moreover, less Vitamin D intake (OR 9.7; p > .05), less intake of Calcium (OR = 12.2, p > .05); In addition increase one unit in the BMI, cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and FBS increased the log odd of having liability of Vitamin D deficiency by 3.2; 1.9, 1.8, 1.0, and 2.4 (p > .05).
Conclusion
Vitamin D Deficiency was prevalent in both males and females across different age groups in the citizens of Saudi. Because of the connection between Vitamin D Deficiency and main chronic disease, it is necessary to emphasize the need to recognize Vitamin D Deficiency screening for risk factors. It may be reasonable for the nutritionists, nurses, and physicians, to encourage the community on approaches to enhance dietary Vitamin D or suggest supplementation."

Besides the traditional risk factors, hematological changes may be involved in the development of arterial hypertension and in its pathogenesis.
Methods
The study, conducted on a sample of 545 subjects, 215 with hypertension and 330 witnesses, were evaluated for peripheral blood parameters in western Algeria; Logistic regression analysis was used to predict hypertension with hematological parameters.
Results
The characters studied related significantly; lower red blood cell levels have a three-and-a-half-fold risk of developing hypertension compared to those who have normal red blood cell counts (OR = 3.64, 95% CI = 1.37–9.65, p < 0.05). Subjects who have mean corpuscular volume rate below 80 fl are more exposed to hypertension (OR = 13.58, 95% CI = 4.68–39.41, p = 0.000). The mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration reveals that subjects who have a lower than normal (<27 pg) are once less exposed to hypertension (OR = 0.04, 95% CI = 0.01–0.13, p = 0.000). Subjects who have lower platelet count than normal are twelve times more exposed to hypertension (OR = 12.13, 95% CI = 1.45–101.18, P = 0.021). Finally, the increase in sedimentation rate at one hour increases the risk of hypertension by 56.63 times compared to subjects with normal sedimentation rate (OR = 56.63, 95% CI = 3.37–597.33, P = 0.001).
Conclusions
Hematological profile associated with essential hypertension retained Red blood cells ratio, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, platelet ratio, and sedimentation rate at one hour."

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is related to the increased risk of major cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The link between high serum total bilirubin (TBL) is cross-sectionally related to MetS and its components. However, whether serum TBL predicts incidence of MetS and its components remains inconclusive.
Methods
The present study included 893 women aged 70 ± 9 years from a rural village. We examined the relationship between serum TBL and MetS based on the modified criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP-ATP) III report in a cross-sectional (N = 893) and cohort (N = 288) data.
Results
In the cross-sectional study, serum TBL (β = 0.536, p < 0.001) as well as age, alcohol consumption, exercise habits, history of CVD, SUA, GGT, and ALT was significantly and dependently associated with number of MetS components, but in the cohort study serum TBL was not associated with number of MetS components. Compared with the 1st tertile of serum TBL (0.20–0.55 mg/dL), multivariate-adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for the 2nd -3rd tertiles of serum TBL (0.54–2.00 mg/dL) was 0.70 (0.51–0.95) in the cross-sectional study and 0.41 (0.21–0.81) in the cohort study.
Conclusions
Our data demonstrated an independently negative association between serum TBL and MetS in Japanese community-dwelling women."

According to American Heart Association, PAD is defined as, “a narrowing of peripheral arteries to the legs, stomach, arms and the head-most commonly the arteries of leg.” The global prevalence for PAD with age adjusted prevalence is approximately 12%, and it affects relatively 8 to 12 million British people. The prevalence of PAD is 2–3 times higher in person with v/s without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Various subjective and objective methods are available to diagnose PAD, which includes questionnaires for pain and quality of life as subjective and Ankle Brachial Index (ABI), toe brachial index (TBI), arterial doppler for objective. ABI is one of the most reliable and easy to carry out method in clinical setups to diagnose PAD. The normal range for ABI is 0.9–1.29, 0.91 to 0.99 are considered as borderline, 0.41 to 0.91 are considered as mild to moderate diseased and below 0.4 is severe PAD. The objective of the study is to estimate the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease with type 2 diabetes mellitus in coastal Karnataka.
Methodology
A total of 317 participants were recruited for the study based on inclusion criteria. Ethical clearance was taken from the Institutional Ethics Committee. Participants were explained about the study and informed consent was obtained from the participants. Inclusion criteria was any individual with T2DM on medication. A subjective questionnaire specific to PAD was administered to the participants. Along with this the objective measure, ABI was done on the individuals.

Self-care support provided by healthcare providers (HCPs) is critical to diabetes self-care. However, a number of barriers prevent HCPs from providing self-care support to people with diabetes. We explored attitudes towards, barriers and facilitators of the provision of diabetes self-care support among Ghanaian HCPs.
Methods
Fourteen semi-structured interviews were conducted among HCPs recruited from three diabetes clinics in Tamale, Ghana. All interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were coded and analysed thematically.
Results
HCPs reported a sense of responsibility and urgency to provide self-care education to diabetes patients; while believing it was the patients' responsibility to self-care for their diabetes condition. Accordingly, HCPs perceived their role to be limited to information sharing rather than behaviour change interventions. Facilitators to the provision of self-care support included patients’ motivation, and team work among healthcare professionals. Barriers that hindered self-care support included language barriers and poor inter-professional collaboration. Furthermore, HCPs discussed that they felt inadequately trained to provide self-care support. Healthcare-system-related barriers were inadequate office space, lack of professional development programmes, high patient numbers, inadequate staff numbers, inadequate health insurance and a lack of sufficient supplies and equipment in the hospital.
Conclusion
HCPs attitudes were generally favourable towards supporting self-care, albeit with a focus on information provision rather than behaviour change. Training in effective strategies for providing self-care support are needed, and better use of the resources that are available."

The previous studies have revealed that there is a link between dietary glycemic index and lipid profile in overweight and obesity. The aim of study was to investigate whether the glycemic index is associated with liver enzymes.
Method
Anthropometric and biochemical parameters were measured in 265 participants. Dietary glycemic index (GI) was assessed by using a validated food-frequency questionnaire. With adjusting confounder variable, Binary logistic regression was also used to predict the relationship between liver enzymes and quartile of intake.
Results
There was a significant difference between low and high GI diet for BMR (P = 0.01), FFM (P = 0.03), TG (P = 0.02), HDL (P = 0.002). The association between HDL and glycemic index remained significant after adjustment of sex and age (P = 0.03). Using the regression model following adjustment revealed that for each 1% increase in the degree of the GI, there was 11% elevation in liver enzyme abnormalities. In both groups of men and women, enzyme abnormalities positively correlated with GI, while only men showed remarkable correlation in all models (crude model: β = 0.07, OR = 1.07, CI = 0.98to 1.16). Additionally, an increase in the degree of GI caused an elevation in enzyme abnormalities by 7%. With adjusting sex, age, BMI, and Physical activity, a significance correlation was found between GI and Enzyme abnormalities (p-value = 0.03, OR = 1.115).
Conclusion
Our study indicated that high glycemic index diet led to the elevated levels of the liver enzymes, while being significant only in men."

In addition, other tools such as transient elastography are limited to specialized research centers. To assess the usefulness of CK-18 as a non-invasive biomarker for detecting therapeutic responses in patients with liver fibrosis.
Materials and methods
Sixty overweight and obese patients with liver fibrosis were evaluated by a dietitian and given a weight-reducing diet with a calorie deficit of 500–1000 kcal/day over a 6-month period. Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) both were performed at the beginning and at the end of the trial to determine liver steatosis and liver fibrosis, respectively. Serum CK-18 levels were measured by enzyme linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) at baseline and at 3 and 6 months after intervention.
Results
Patients experienced a rapid weight loss of −7.6 kg (8.5%) during the trial. Among all participants, liver steatosis decreased from 76.5 ± 12.2% to 51.8 ± 24.4% (baseline to end-point) (p < 0.001) and fibrosis score decreased from 9.9 ± 3.7 to 7.2 ± 2.4 (p < 0.001) (a 27.2% decrease). Serum CK-18 levels decreased from 290.2 ± 98.1 U/L to 217.6 ± 64.8 U/L (p < 0.001) (a 25.0% decrease). ΔCK-18 was found to be significantly associated with delta fibrosis score (r = 0.25, p = 0.05)
Conclusions
This trial showed a significant positive association between changes in CK-18 levels and changes in liver fibrosis over a 6-month dietary intervention"

In recent times, evidences point to the link between thyroid hormones andT2DM in particular. Several lines of evidences suggest an array of biochemical and molecular events. Gene polymorphism, disturbances in gene expression and regulation, enhanced and bizarre absorption of dietary glucose from intestine, decreased utilization of glucose by tissues and aberrations in hepatic handling of glucose with the onus on Gluconeogenesis are some of the projected mechanisms. Insulin resistance, a progressive condition is the hallmark in T2DM. Hypothyroidism as well as hyperthyroidism have been associated with insulin resistance which are synonymous with impaired glucose metabolism in T2DM. A multitude of basic, clinical and molecular studies provide an insight into thyroid comorbidity in T2DM, though there are a few instances to suggest equivocal link denoting cause-effect relationship. In biochemical pharmacology, as fortified by pharmacogenomics, modalities have now been proposed, through drug trials, to underline the utility of specifically designed thyroid hormone analogues in addressing metabolic syndrome, DM and associated cardiovascular pathology. A thorough understanding of the physiological, biochemical and molecular mechanisms would certainly open newer vistas in the perspectives of T2DM with special reference to alterations in thyroid status."

Peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes mellitus. This study was set to assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation on peripheral neuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).
Materials and methods
This study was a quasi-experimental trial in Yazd diabetic research center. Sixty T2DM subjects (30–65 years old) with painful diabetic neuropathy enrolled in this study from March 2017 till April 2018. Patients received weekly 50000 IU of vitamin D3 for 12 weeks orally. Evaluation of diabetic neuropathy was performed by using Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI) before and after trial. Also fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, calcium and vitamin D checked before and after the trial. SPSS version 20 software was used for statistical analysis. P ≤ 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
Results
Among 60 T2DM patients, 58 completed the study. Most of them (53.4%) were male. At the end of study, HbA1c, vitamin D, MNSI (both questionnaire and physical examination) improved that is statistically significant (p-value: <0.001).
Conclusion
Oral supplementation of vitamin D 3 (50,000 IU) once weekly for 12 weeks was associated with improvement in the serum level of vitamin D and significant decrease in the symptoms and sign of diabetic neuropathy. So serum vitamin D level should be checked in persons with diabetic neuropathy and low levels of it should be corrected in order to reducing neuropathy severity."

Essential hypertension is an important risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. Important candidate genes such as NOS3 gene have been widely studied and reported to be associated with essential hypertension (HTN) in human populations.
Aim
We aim in this study to analyze the relationship between NOS3 -786T/C, a common genetic variant and HTN in a sample of the Algerian population of the Oran city.
Methods
A case-control study has been performed in 154 subjects including 77 hypertensives and 77 normotensives. The recruitment of these subjects was done in local Health Centers of the city of Oran, West Algeria. HTN was defined as elevated systolic blood pressure SBD≥140  mmHg and or sustained diastolic blood pressure DBP≥90  mmHg, measured using an Omron® Automatic BP Monitor - M-3W machine. Consents were obtained from all participants. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined with restrictive fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was used to genotype the NOS -786T/C variant.
Results
The distribution of the allelic frequencies did not differ between cases and controls (OR = 1.48; 95%CI [0.94–2.32], P = 0.09). However, after adjustment with the age, sex, and body mass index, we observed significant association between NOS -786C allele and HTN status (OR = 2.08; 95%CI [1.18–3.66], P = 0.01).
Conclusion
Our results indicate that the C allele of the NOS3 gene is associated with increased risk of essential hypertension in this sample of the Algerian population of the Oran city. Further validation in larger samples is needed to confirm this finding."

abstract = "Background
Diabetic nephropathy may be a common complication of diabetes mellitus. Endoglin is glycoprotein located on cell surfaces of endothelial cells and is part of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF- β) receptor. Endoglin expression is enhanced in endothelial cells during injury and inflammation. The aim of this study was to estimate the plasma level of soluble endoglin (sEng) in type 2 diabetic patients (with and without nephropathy). Also to explore its availability as marker for disease progression.
Methods
In this study, sixty eight patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were included; the patients were sub-grouped to normoalbuminuria without nephropathy and moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria) with nephropathy groups with 13 individuals as control group. Plasma soluble endoglin level was determined using ELISA technique. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid profile, and creatinine were determined using colorimetric assay, whereas glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated.
Results
The plasma level of sEng of both normoalbuminuria group 1 and microalbuminuria group 2 were significantly higher when compared to control group. While, the plasma level of sEng in microalbuminuria group 2 was nonsignificant lower when compared to normoalbuminuria group 1. Also, there was a significant positive association between plasma level of sEng and HbA1c, HDL-C and urinary albumin concentration in normoalbuminuria group.
Conclusion
Plasma level of soluble Endoglin is markedly increase prior to alteration in endothelial function, and increases to lesser extent with the developing of diabetic nephropathy which indicated disease progression and development of vascular abnormalities."

The role of dietary patterns in metabolic syndrome has not been investigated sufficiently among Iranian population. The aim of this study is to investigate the association of major dietary patterns with the risk of metabolic syndrome and its components among healthy individuals of Iran.
Methods
This is a cross-sectional study that was performed on 5895 men and women who participated in MASHAD study project. Factor analysis was employed to determine major dietary patterns with regard to a validated 65-item food frequency questionnaire. Metabolic syndrome was diagnosed using international diabetes federation (IDF). Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between dietary patterns and metabolic syndrome risk to generate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).
Results
Three major dietary patterns (Balanced, Western and high carbohydrate) were identified. The Western pattern showed a positive association with metabolic syndrome (OR [95%CI] for highest vs. lowest tertile: 1.58 [1.21–2.06]; p value = 0.001). The high carbohydrate dietary pattern was associated with higher metabolic syndrome risk (OR [95%CI] for highest vs. lowest tertile: 1.17 [1.02–1.33]; P value = 0.022). The Balanced dietary pattern was unrelated to metabolic syndrome, but was related to some individual risk factors for metabolic syndrome.

Previous studies have explored the relation of metabolic syndrome (MetS), its components and the risk of albuminuria/proteinuria but their results are inconsistent. Then, we aimed to conduct a meta-analysis in order to resolve these controversies.
Method
PubMed and Scopus were systematically searched from their inception to 1 march 2018. Risk estimates and their 95% confidence intervals were extracted and pooled using the random-effects approach.
Result
A total of 57 studies, 44 studies on albuminuria and 13 studies on proteinuria, with a total sample size of 10,603,067 participants, were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, MetS was contributed to higher risks of proteinuria (OR = 2.08, 95%CI = 1.85–2.34) and albuminuria (OR = 1.92, 95%CI = 1.71–2.15), independent of diabetes status; although, this relationship was more noticeable in studies that used the WHO definition of MetS and in non-East Asian populations. Also, the relationship between MetS and proteinuria was sex independent, while, for albuminuria was significant only in men. MetS components such as obesity, impaired fasting glucose, elevated blood pressure and hypertriglyceridemia were associated with significant increases in proteinuria and albuminuria risk, while lower HDL-Cholesterol was only linked to greater risk of proteinuria. Moreover, the total impact of MetS on proteinuria was more remarkable than each component of the syndrome and an escalating dose-response association was found between the number of MetS components and albuminuria risk.
Conclusion
MetS and its components are potential risk factors for albuminuria and proteinuria."

Methods
platelet gels were obtained from homologous platelet concentrates that were aliquoted and freezed, being then activated with calcium gluconate and applied in the ulcer after cleaning and debridement. We evaluated patient's comorbidities, wound characteristics (size, tissue, inflammatory signs, pain), number and time of treatment as well as outcome (classified as complete epithelialization; partial improvement- 50% reduction in wound size or pain relief; no evolution).
Results
Fifty-two patients (42 males, 10 females), with a median age of 65 years (range 43–85) were proposed for platelet gel. The following associated comorbidities were observed: hypertension (n = 41), dyslipidemia (n = 29), polyneuropathy (n = 30), peripheral arteriopathy (n = 32), retinopathy (n = 21), nephropathy (n = 15), cardiac ischemic disease (n = 14), obesity (n = 9). Thirty-eight patients presented with 3 or more associated comorbidities. The more frequent ulcer locations were sole of the foot (n = 13) and heel (n = 10). The median number of applications was 16, during 8.5 weeks. Nineteen patients (44%) achieved complete healing, 3 patients (7%) had a partial response and 21 (49%) had no progression. We did not observe a statistically significant relationship between patient age and response nor between number of comorbidities and response. We observed a more favorable evolution in patients with good compliance and good glycemic control.

abstract = "Aims
Recent studies have implicated possible contribution of adipocytokines in development and progression of microvascular complications in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). The aim of our study was to investigate relationship between adipocytokines, namely leptin, resistin, adiponectin and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) activity, with albuminuria in T1DM.
Methods
This study included 202 T1DM without or with incipient microvascular complications. Urinary albumin excretion rate (UAE) was measured from at least two 24-h urine samples. Serum DPP-4 activity was measured by a colorimetric assay, and the level of adiponectin, leptin, and resistin was determined by the ELISA method.
Results
Serum DPP-4 activity and adiponectin were significantly higher in patients with normoalbuminuria compared to patients with microalbuminuria (47 vs 36 U/L, and 10.9 vs 7.3 μg/mL, respectively, p ≤ 0.02). In multivariate logistic regression analysis adiponectin and serum DPP-4 activity were significantly associated with risk of microalbuminuria in our subjects (p ≤ 0.04), with odds ratios of 0.72–0.99. However, after adjustment for age, sex, HbA1c, duration of diabetes and BMI, only serum DPP-4 activity was significantly associated with risk of microalbuminuria (p = 0.008).
Conclusion
The results of our study suggest that serum DPP-4 activity is lower in T1DM with microalbuminuria. Prospective studies are warranted to evaluate the relationship between serum DPP-4 activity and progression and development of albuminuria and nephropathy in T1DM."

Visceral Adiposity Index (VAI) is a formula to estimate visceral fat accumulation which has been reported to have a better prediction for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Caucasian population. This systematic review is proposed to inquire whether VAI can be used as a predictor of T2DM in Asian population with different body composition compared to the Caucasian.
Methods
All studies performed in Asia and published in English on VAI prediction on the incidence of T2DM were included. The search keywords used in Pubmed and Cochrane database were visceral adiposity index, VAI and T2DM.
Results
Seven included studies, of which six studies were conducted in China and one in Iran. Four studies were prospective cohorts and the other three were cross-sectional. The largest study population were 7639 subjects, while the longest observation period was 15 years. This study found that VAI can be used as a predictor of T2DM in Asian population with better prediction values compared to Caucasian population. The reported odds ratio or hazard ratio ranged from 1.2 to 3.6.
Conclusions
VAI is a practical formula used to estimate the accumulation of visceral fat which can be used as a predictor for T2DM in Asian population."

abstract = "Diabetes is a common metabolic disorder associated to elevated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality that is not explained by hyperglycemia or traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking or hypercholesterolemia. Intensive glycemic control with insulin that achieves near-normal glycemia does not reduce significantly macrovascular complications compared with conventional glycemic control. Cardiovascular disease continues to develop in patients with diabetes despite adequate glycemic control. In contrast, intensive control with metformin (leading to insulin resistance improvement) reduces diabetes complications, including cardiovascular events, suggesting that enhancement of insulin sensitivity rather than plasma glucose level has a major role improving diabetes outcomes. Accordingly, insulin resistance estimated by glucose tolerance tests is better predictor of future cardiovascular events than fasting glucose level in nondiabetic individuals. Insulin resistance precedes for decades the clinical onset of type 2 diabetes and deteriorates metabolic control of type 1 diabetes. Numerous investigations including cross-sectional and prospective studies, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews provide compelling evidence that insulin resistance by itself is a cardiovascular risk factor in a variety of population groups, including the general population and patients with diabetes. Several estimations of insulin resistance have been consistently associated with elevated rate of cardiovascular events independently of other cardiovascular risk factors and diabetes status. The clinical expression of insulin resistance (the metabolic syndrome or any of its components including obesity, hyperinsulinemia, hypertension, and dyslipemia) has been related to cardiovascular disease as well. An estimation conducted by the Archimedes model confirms that insulin resistance is the most important single cause of coronary artery disease."

Obesity is an emerging public health concern in Bangladesh. This study aimed to find the levels of the serum malondialdehyde (MDA), non-enzymatic antioxidants (vitamin A, C and E), trace elements (zinc and iron) and macro-minerals (calcium, potassium and sodium) in obesity and its action in disease advancement.
Methods
Level of lipid peroxidation was estimated by measurement of the serum concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA). Vitamin A and E concentration was found by RP-HPLC method and vitamin C was assessed for serum ascorbic acid by UV spectrophotometric method. Serum trace elements (Zn and Fe) and macro-minerals (Na, K and Ca) were estimated by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS).
Results
Our study observed significantly elevated concentrations of MDA (p < 0.001) and depleted concentrations of antioxidants (vitamin A, E and C) (p < 0.05) in the patient than control group. Analysis of serum trace elements (Zn and Fe) and macro-minerals (Na, K and Ca) and found that the mean values of Zn, Fe, Na, K and Ca were 0.39 ± 0.02 and 0.43 ± 0.03, 3284.81 ± 34.51, 162.18 ± 3.72, 44.62 ± 2.13 mg/L for the patient and 0.91 ± 0.13, 0.88 ± 0.06, 2562.74 ± 95.92, 243.58 ± 8.97, 87.66 ± 2.10 mg/L for the controls, consequently.

To determine optimal waist circumference cutoff values for predicting metabolic syndrome (MetS) among adults aged 60 years and older in Ecuador.
Material and methods
The National Survey of Health, Wellbeing, and Aging survey was used to describe the prevalence of MetS according to standard definitions. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analyses and the Younden index J (YI) were performed to examine optimal waist circumference cutoff values for predicting MetS. Moreover, the prevalence of MetS according to country-specific waist circumference cutoff values was compared with those using standard definitions.
Results
Among 2306 participants with a mean age of 70.6 years, the optimal waist circumference cutoff value for predicting MetS was 90.7 cm in women with a sensitivity of 66.1%, specificity of 65.6% and YI of 0.31. In men, a waist circumference of 91.2 cm with a sensitivity of 73.2%, specificity of 62.8%, and YI of 0.36 was the optimal cutoff point for predicting MetS. In general, applying country-specific cutoff values decreased the prevalence of MetS among older Ecuadorian women. In men, except with the ATP III definition, similar MetS prevalence rates were seen whether the country-specific or standard waist circumference cutoff values were applied.
Conclusions
The optimal waist circumference cutoff values for predicting metabolic syndrome among older Ecuadorians adults were 90.7 cm for women and 91.2 cm for men. Moreover, current standard definitions of abdominal obesity may overestimate the prevalence of MetS, particularly in Latin American women."

To assess the association between high waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) levels and insulin resistance (IR) or hyperinsulinemia after oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in a sample of normal-weight women.
Methods
We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study in euthyroid non-diabetic women, who attended the outpatient service of a private clinic in Lima-Peru from 2012 to 2016. Participants were divided in two groups according to the presence or absence of high WHR levels, IR or hyperinsulinemia after OGTT. We considered WHR values > 0.85 as high levels. IR was defined as a Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) value > 2.39 and hyperinsulinemia after OGTT as a serum insulin value ≥ 80μU/mL after 120 min of 75-g glucose intake. We elaborated crude and adjusted Poisson generalized linear models to evaluate the association between high WHR levels and IR or hyperinsulinemia after OGTT and reported the prevalence ratio (PR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).
Results
We analyzed the data of 248 euthyroid, non-diabetic and normal-weight women. The prevalence of high WHR levels was 68.9% (n = 171) while the prevalence of IR and hyperinsulinemia after OGTT was 25% (n = 62) and 15.3% (n = 38), respectively. WHR values were positively correlated with HOMA-IR (r = 0.307; p < 0.001) and serum insulin after OGTT (r = 0.260; p < 0.001). In the adjusted model, high WHR levels were associated with both IR (aPR = 2.63; 95%CI: 1.39–5.01) and hyperinsulinemia after OGTT (aPR = 2.35; 95%CI: 1.03–5.38).
Conclusion
High WHR levels were associated with both IR markers used in our study, appearing to be a useful anthropometric indicator to assess IR in euthyroid normal-weight women without type 2 diabetes mellitus."

A total of 300 T2DM female aged (25–60 years) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Subjects were recruited from Baghdad medical city during the period from January 2017 to July 2018. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), blood pressure was measured and fasting blood sample was analyzed for blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin(HbA1c), and lipid profile. VAI was calculated in addition to triglyceride-glucose (TyG) derived indices. Statistical analysis was done by SPSS version 23. The study was ethically approved.
Results
Patients with high VAI showed poor glycemic control, dyslipidemia, elevated TYG index, TYGWC and TYGBMI. The number of diabetics with poor glycemic control increased across the VAI quartiles. The area under the curve in ROC analysis demonstrated that VAI had a good predictive ability to identify the state of glycemic control as compared to other anthropometric measures (WC, BMI) or combined metabolic and anthropometric measures (TyGWC, TyGBMI).

Paraoxonase-1 (PON1) has been shown to protect low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) against oxidative-modification and thereby might protect against coronary-artery-disease (CAD). Here we explored the relationship of a genetic variant (a substitution (R) Arg with (Q) Gln at position 192) of PON1 in 250 patients with/without CAD.
Materials and methods
Genotyping of PON1 Q192R was carried out using Real-Time-PCR TaqMan-based-probe. Demographic-characteristics and biochemical-analyses, including fasting blood sugar (FBS), HDL, LDL, triglycerides (TG) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were evaluated. Univariate/multivariate analyses were performed to determine the association of the genetic polymorphism and CAD as well as with clinical-characteristics of population.
Results
Our findings showed that RR-genotype was more frequent in CAD-patients, compared to the wild-type genotype. Moreover, CAD patients with RR-genotype had an odd ratio of 5.0 (95% CI: 1.3–18.6; p = 0.017), versus wild-type genotype, in multivariate-analysis. Of note we also observed that CAD-patients with QQ-genotype had a significantly lower Hs-CRP level, compared to the RR-genotype.
Conclusion
we demonstrate that PON1-Q192R-polymorphism was associated with CRP and FBS levels; R-allele of PON1-Q192R may be an independent risk factor for CAD. Further studies are warranted to determine the value of this marker as a surrogate marker in CAD patients."

Diabetic foot is a major comorbidity of diabetes, with 15–25% of diabetic patients developing diabetic foot ulcer during their lifetime. Other major diabetic foot complications include cellulitis, abscess, wet gangrene, dry gangrene, and necrotizing fasciitis. Dry gangrene involves tissue necrosis due to chronic ischemia whereby the tissue becomes numb, dry, wrinkled, and dead. Although diabetic foot complications have been extensively studied in literature, there is limited data on the management of dry gangrene.
Methods
We report a case series of 12 patients with diabetes-related dry gangrene in the toes, initially planned to be managed conservatively with autoamputation.
Results
One patient had an autoamputation, while eight patients underwent surgical amputations (six major amputations, two minor amputations) for better clinical outcomes. Two patients died, while no change was observed in one patient even after 12 months of follow-up.
Conclusion
Managing diabetic dry toe gangrene by waiting for autoamputation may lead to worse clinical outcomes and should be practiced cautiously on a case-by-case basis. Early surgical intervention should be opted to improve patients’ quality of life."

abstract = "Aim
We aimed to screen for prediabetes, diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors among family members of people with diabetes registered for care in a primary health centre in South India.
Methods
During 2017–2018, we screened eligible family members of individuals with diabetes at their homes. We measured fasting capillary blood glucose (FCBG); for those with FCBG≥126 mg/dl, we confirmed the diagnosis of diabetes with fasting plasma glucose (FPG). We defined prediabetes as FCBG between 100 and 125 mg/dl; diabetes as both FCBG and FPG ≥126 mg/dl. We assessed non-communicable disease risk factors using WHO STEPS questionnaire.
Results
Of total 884 participants, 873 (99%) underwent screening; 280 (32%) had prediabetes, and 19 (2.2%) were confirmed with diabetes. Of newly diagnosed, 17 (90%) were initiated on treatment. Of 873 participants, 180 (20.6%) were newly diagnosed with hypertension. Of the total, 7.3%, 5.2% and 16% reported tobacco use, alcohol use and high salt intake respectively. Nearly half (48%) had overweight.
Conclusion
Though the yield for diabetes is modest (3%), the house to house approach was able to screen 99% of eligible population. High prevalence of prediabetes and undiagnosed hypertension emphasize the need for screening and life style modifications."

Obesity and overweight are among the main causes of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Dyslipidemia, fatty liver index, is strongly related to CVD. Vitamin E as an antioxidant protects the hepatic cells against oxidative stress and prevents fatty liver disease. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the relationship between anthropometric parameters and fasted lipid profile with serum vitamin E levels.
Study design
A randomized trial was designed based on data from the Mashhad stroke and heart atherosclerotic disorders (MASHAD: 2010–2020).
Methods
363 CVD subjects (173 males and 190 females) was selected at random, among 9704 subjects in three regions of Mashhad, northeast of Iran to investigate the specific correlations among their serum vitamin E, lipid profile (TG, HDL-C, LDL-C and TC), and anthropometric features (height, weight, BMI, hip and waist circumferences.
Result
The results indicated the significant relationships between vitamin E, and fasting serum lipid profile in subjects. Serum vitamin E was negatively correlated to TC, TG, and LDL-C and positively related to HDL-C. Also, statistically negative correlations were found between vitamin E and anthropometric parameters (weight, waist and hip circumference, middle Arm, and Systolic Blood Pressure). Moreover, vitamin E ratios such as vitamin E/(TC + TG) and vitamin E/TC values as standardized vitamin E, had significant negative correlation with BMI, the whole of anthropometric parameters, and dyslipidemia risk factors including TC, TG and LDL-C.
Conclusion
We found that vitamin E profile was significantly lower in the dyslipidemia subjects. It is generally suggested that vitamin E monitoring might be used as a useful prognostic and therapeutic agent in dyslipidemia disorder."

abstract = "Background
Diabetes is rising at an alarming rate in India and the national capital forms a significant part of the nation's diabetic population. The metabolic disorder is no more a disease specific to the rich countries but has also markedly spread its roots in middle-income countries.
Objective
To ascertain the prevalence of associated co-morbidities in the diabetic population of Delhi, a metropolitan city in India. Moreover, this study was conducted to help with adding information to the limited shreds of evidence of diabetes prevalence in Delhi along with the usually preferred therapies.
Materials and methods
A cross-sectional, observational, survey-based study was conducted on people (n = 798) of different age groups (18 years and above) belonging to different regions of Delhi. All subjects were enrolled after obtaining oral consent. Detailed information about clinical, demographic and metabolic profiles was obtained with the help of a pre-structured, open-ended questionnaire. The data were analyzed, and the correlation between diabetes and several other fields was drawn.
Results
Out of the 798 diabetic patients 458 (57.39%) were males and 340 (42.60%) were females. The presence of diabetes was higher in the age group of 50–60 years irrespective of the gender.
Co-morbidities
54.13% of patients suffered with additional co-morbidities which is significantly high. The associated co-morbidities found in the survey included Hypertension, Hypothyroidism, Dyslipidemia, Obesity, Coronary Artery Diseases etc. About 30.57% of patients suffered from hypertension making it the most commonly associated co-morbidity. The other diseases included hypothyroidism (11.52%), Dyslipidemia (10.27%), Obesity (9.27%) etc.
Medication
Majority of patients i.e about 60.65% received oral hypoglycemic agents (including patients receiving both insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents). About 19.92% of patients were prescribed with insulin. 14.16% of patients were found to be following diet control and yoga with about 3.13% more females the males. A small percentage of patients (5.25%) were also following alternative systems (Ayurvedic/Unani/Homeopathic) of treatment. Overall, amongst oral hypoglycemic agents, the combination of metformin and DPP4 inhibitors (Vildagliptin, Sitagliptin) was being prescribed majorly i.e 16.41%.
Conclusion
The number of diabetic population is high in Delhi. It was evident that a significant percentage of diabetic patients suffered from additional diseases that may lead to worsening of the health conditions. Thus, there is an urgent need to educate and spread awareness amongst the masses about the potential benefits of lifestyle modifications like the incorporation of a healthy diet and physical activities. Additionally, continuous and regular tests should be taken to avoid further complications."

Assessing of QoL in patients with DR is a prerequisite for the evaluation of their needs and for understanding the perception of the patients themselves about their health status and how the disease affects their lives. Additionally, QoL indicators detect individual psychosocial problems that may impact therapeutic response.
Materials and methods
A total of 70 subjects with T2DM and DR as well as 70 T2DM individuals without DR were included. For the evaluation of QoL we used (a) WHO QoL – BREF for the estimation of QoL, (b) Life Satisfaction Scale for the estimation of satisfaction from life, and (c) the special recording document for demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical data. At the same time, blood was collected for the measurement of glucose control and renal function. DR was diagnosed by dilated fundoscopy.
Results
Patients with DR had significantly worse scores in all scales of QoL and Life Satisfaction in comparison with those without DR. We found significant impact of the severity of DR in many domains of the QoL and Life Satisfaction. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that DR was associated with worse QoL and Life Satisfaction scores as well as lower income, while no significant associations were found with education level, family, insurance and employment status as well as type of residence.

Non-Caucasian migrants require dedicated approaches in diabetes management due to specific genetic; socio-cultural; demographic and anthropological determinants. Documenting such phenotypes allows for better understanding unmet needs and management priorities.
Methods
This age- and sex-adjusted case-control (1:6 ratio) study compared 56 T2DM Turkish migrants (70% males) resident in Belgium [Tu] with 336 T2DM Caucasians [Ca], all benefiting from state-funded healthcare.
Results
The 2 groups did not differ regarding BMI; waist circumference; fat mass; visceral fat; muscle mass; insulin sensitivity; insulinemia; metabolic syndrome; hypertension; lipid-modifying drugs; and macroangiopathy. They also had similar renal function and (micro)albuminuria. Education (low/high) and ethanol consumption were lower among [Tu]: 83/17% and 2.0 U/wk vs 43/57% and 13.6 U/wk in [Ca] (p < 0.0001). β-cell function loss (BCF) was higher in [Tu]: 1.58(0.45) vs 1.35(0.54)%/yr (p 0.0027), as was HbA1c: 8.39(1.91) vs 7.48(1.35)% in [Ca] (p < 0.0001). Diabetes duration and insulin use were increased in [Tu]: 19(9)yr and 70% vs 16(8)yr and 48% in [Ca] (p 0.0111 and 0.0024). Atherogenic dyslipidemia (AD) was more prevalent in [Tu]: 64% vs 49% (p 0.0309), who had higher non-HDL-C; apolipoprotein B100; LDL-C; and triglycerides; and lower HDL-C and apolipoprotein A-I levels (all p < 0.05). Overall microangiopathy; retinopathy; and neuropathy were more prevalent in [Tu]: 55-35-37% vs 40-18-20% in [Ca] (all p < 0.05).
Conclusions
These results should raise concerns about poor glycaemic control; rapid BCF loss; severe AD; and microangiopathy among Turkish migrants with T2DM. Targeting AD could improve the cardiometabolic profile of this minority given the relationship between AD and residual vascular risk."

Controlled glycemia (CG) was recognized as glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≤7% depending on American Diabetes Association guidelines 2018. Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was used to estimate the confounding influence of co-morbidities and predict ES-10Y. Data was managed by IBM-SPSS 23.0.
Results
A total of 400 cases categorized to (44.25%) patients with CG, and (55.75%) cases had uncontrolled glycemia (UCG). HbA1c mean in CG and UCG group was (6.8 ± 0.9 vs 9.5 ± 1.6, P-value: 0.001). Fasting blood glucose was (7 ± 2.3 vs. 9.9 ± 4.3, P-value: 0.001) in CG and UCG group. CCI was (3.38 ± 2.38 vs. 4.42 ± 2.70, P-value: 0.001) and, ES-10Y was (62% vs 46.2%, p-value: 0.001) in CG vs. UCG respectively. Spearman test indicates a negative correlation between CG and CCI (r: 0.19, p-value: 0.001). Logistic regression confirmed HbA1c as a significant predictor of CCI (r2: 0.036, P-value: 0.001). CG has a positive correlation with survival (r: 0.16, P-value: 0.001) and logistic regression of survival (r2: 0.26, P-value: 0.001).
Conclusions
More than one-half of the investigated persons had UCG. Controlled HbA1c was associated with lower co-morbidities and higher ES-10Y."

Prediabetes associate with known micro and macrovascular complications of diabetes. Also gastrointestinal symptoms are present in diabetics higher than general population. The aim of this study was evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms in subjects with prediabetes.
Methods
This analytical cross-sectional study was conducted on 130 persons 30–65 years old, 65 pre-diabetic patients and 65 persons without glucose disorders from 2014 to 2015 in YAZD province. FBS and HbA1c used for diagnosis prediabetes. Demographic and medical history were collected. A questionnaire according to Rome III Criteria was used to collect digestive information (diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation, abdominal bloating, heartburn, increased gas passing, nausea, intermittent diarrhea and constipation in the last 6 months ago). Frequency of GI symptoms in subjects with and without glucose disorders were compared. Data were analyzed by SPSS software Version 20. Data were reported as mean ± standard deviation or frequency and T-test, Chi Square and Spearman correlation coefficient tests were used. P-value less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Higher frequency of bloating, early satiety, nausea, heartburn, gas passing and constipation are seen in the pre-diabetes group than in the control group; (p-value 0.0001, 0.0001, 0.0001, 0.0001, 0.001 and 0.0001 respectively). 96.9% in prediabetics had at least one gastrointestinal symptom, while in the normal groups 50% had at least one GI symptom (p-value: 0.0001).
Conclusions
Gastrointestinal symptoms were seen in prediabetics higher than healthy persons. So, prediabetes can not be considered an entirely benign and asymptomatic condition. Lifestyle interventions maybe necessary at this state."

abstract = "Background
Diabetes mellitus, a lifelong disease is achieving pandemic proportions. The prevalence of diabetes is on the rise and is expected to be worlds 7th leading cause of death by 2030. Studies have associated a number of risk factors like obesity, lack of physical activity, sedentarism, diet, and stress to diabetes mellitus. The job of bank employees is both sedentary in nature and involves high levels of stress. These people spend almost all their working hours seated as they carry out their work. With this background, the primary objective study of this project is to identify risk factors of diabetes mellitus among bank employees of selected banks in Ndola town. This study also aims to find the prevalence of diabetes among bank employees in the selected nine banks.
Methods
A cross-section study was conducted on 121 bank employees from nine (9) selected banks of Ndola town center. Information about their biosocial characteristics, their weight, height, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose was measured and recorded and a questionnaire on physical activity of participants was administered. Data was analyzed by SPSS 20.0 for Windows. Univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis were conducted to ascertain any correlation between the dependent variables and independent variables.
Results
Prevalence of diabetes mellitus was found to be 15%. The risk of developing Diabetes mellitus was high in obese participants (OR 5.1 [cl95%] p = 0.000). And in physical inactive participants it was also high (OR 7.6 [cl95%] p = 0.046).
Conclusion
and recommendations: Diabetes mellitus shows significant correlation with physical inactivity, body mass index, blood pressure, age and sex. Findings in this study support the need for programs to promote employee health, to help prevent and monitor the enormity and temporal trends of these factor as well as asses the actions that are directed toward this population group."

We aimed at assessing cardiovascular risk of first degree relatives of diabetes (FDRD).
Methods
A cross sectional study involving 90 apparently healthy normoglycemic volunteers aged between 15 and 50 years (45 FDRD and 45 FDRs of non-diabetics). We measured anthropometric parameters, baroreflex sensitivity, heart rate variability, cardiac autonomic function tests, and aerobic capacity, fasting blood glucose and insulin, lipid profile, inflammatory markers, nitric oxide and oxidative stress markers.
Results
FDRD had significantly higher hip circumference and BF%. Blood pressure, total peripheral resistance and cardiac output were comparable. FDRD had higher HR and rate pressure product. There were no significant differences in cardio-respiratory fitness (VO2max) and physical activity level. Time and Frequency domain parameters were comparable except for reduced NN50 and total power. Baroreflex sensitivity, 30:15 ratio and E: I ratio were significantly less in FDRD. Fasting glucose was comparable. Fasting Insulin, HOMA IR, HOMA %B and HOMA AD were higher while HOMA %S and QUICKI index were lower in FDRD. Lipid profile or lipid derived parameters were comparable except for higher non-HDLc in FDRD. Adiponectin was lower while Leptin and Leptin/apidonectin ratio was higher in FDRD. IL-6, hsCRP, TNF- alpha and MDA were significantly higher in FDRD, while TAS and nitric oxide were significantly lower in FDRD.
Conclusion
Higher body fat percentage, with insulin resistance, deranged cardiac autonomic function, higher oxidative stress and inflammation, lower adiponectin and nitric oxide levels places FDRD at higher cardiovascular risk and necessitates early lifestyle modification/intervention."

With numerous controlled experimental studies of dapagliflozin, evaluation of real-life data after entry into clinical practice is an important condition. In our study, the effects of dapagliflozin (10 mg) on lipid profile were investigated retrospectively.
Methods
A total of thirty-one type 2 diabetic patients with HbA1c level between 6,5% and 13%, aged 45–80 years and whose body mass index higher than 20 kg/m2 were enrolled to the study. Data before dapagliflozin treatment and three and six months results were recorded.
Results
Dapagliflozin reduced HbA1c levels by 0,9% at 3 months and 0,79% at 6 months. Total cholesterol level decreased 17,6 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol level decreased 13,4 mg/dl and triglyceride level by 25.9 mg/dl at the 6th months and it is observed that there is no serious side effect on the usage for 6 months.
Conclusion
There are conflicting results about the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on the lipid profile in the literature. According to our data, dapagliflozin has positive effects on lipid profile as weight and glycemic control and it is well tolerated. Therefore, dapagliflozin therapy is beneficial because of the positive change in lipid profile and weight loss in diabetic patients with overweight and hyperlipidemia."

Background
Non high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in people with type 2 diabetes. The aim of our study is to estimate the relative multivariate risk of non-HDL-C in the occurrence of CVD in a population in the extreme western Algeria with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Methods
Our study was carried out in western Algeria on a population of 1111 subjects, 371 cardiopaths with T2DM and 740 controls. The biochemical balance was established using standard enzymatic procedures (SFBC or IFCC recommendations) on the Beckman CX7® PLC (Beckman-Coulter®, NY, USA). Information on the pathologies was collected by means of a questionnaire.
Results
The logistic model retained the two levels of non-HDL-C: 130 mg/dl < non-HDL-C≤160 mg/dl (OR = 0.11; 95% CI = 0.03–0,47, P = 0.003) and 160 mg/dl < non-HDL-C≤190 mg/dl (OR = 5.02; 95% CI = 1.1–22.87, P = 0.037) and smoking (OR = 19.27; 95% CI = 3.39–109.63, P = 0.001), inbreeding (OR = 3.65; 95% CI = 1.12–11,85, P = 0.031) and the two age groups 60–70 years (OR = 2.36; 95% CI = 1.32–4.2, P<<0.01) and 70 years and over (OR = 2.26; 95% CI = 1.19–4.29, P<<0.05).

Methods
A two-phase study was conducted which included cognitive interviews in the first phase (N = 12) to ensure retrieval from memory of relevant information to respond to questions. The second phase included recruitment of respondents from an internet re-contact survey (N = 560) using NHWS or other Lightspeed panels. Patients’ self-reported measures were collected to identify the potential barriers to T2DM treatment initiation or continuation. All measured variables were summarized descriptively using means and standard deviations for continuous variables, and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables.
Results
A total of 560 respondents were assessed. Of those who were drug-naïve and ever been recommended prescription medication, only 17.3% were satisfied with how physicians presented the treatment options compared to current users or those who discontinued treatment (47.2% and 47.6% respectively). More than 50% of respondents did not realize neuropathic pain and end organ damage as potential consequences of untreated T2DM. 34.8% and 47.6% of drug-naïve and T2DM respondents who discontinued treatment were likely to start/restart treatment after realizing potential complications. Among those who discontinued treatment, 23.1% were extremely dissatisfied with their dosing frequency and less than 15% reported that their physicians discussed the importance of staying on medication long-term.
Conclusion
The potential barriers addressed in this study should be considered when planning intervention strategies targeted at T2DM patients to promote their treatment in Japan."

abstract = "Background
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an important cause of global mortality and morbidity. Body mass index (BMI) is the measure of adiposity that is used most frequently in CVD risk algorithms.
Aims
We aimed to assess the relationship between several CVD risk factors (RFs) and percent body fat (PBF), and to compare the predictive values obtained using PBF for these cardiovascular RFs with the values obtained using BMI. The CVD RFs included, hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM) and the presence of dyslipidemia (DLP).
Methods and materials
The data were derived from the MASHAD study, a cohort study of 9704 volunteers, aged 35–65 years and living in the city of Mashhad. Based on BMI and PBF values, subjects were classified into 4 groups; group 1 (low or normal BMI and PBF, N = 1670), group 2 (low or normal BMI but high PBF, N = 992), group 3 (high BMI and low or normal PBF, N = 837), and group 4 (high BMI and PBF, N = 6245). Chi-square, covariance and logistic regression were used to analyze the data at a significance level of 0.05.
Results
There was an increasing trend from group 1 to group 4 for the mean values of all CVD RFs and their prevalence. There were significant differences in the frequency of a low HDL-C, this was substantially higher in Group 3 (38.6% in Group 3 versus 12.2% in Group 2); the frequency of a high serum TG (24% in Group 3 versus 9.9% in Group 2) and the frequency of dyslipidemia overall (56.2% in Group 3 and 28.8% in Group 2) (P-value<0.001 for all comparisons). The frequency of hypertension (22.9% in Group 3 versus 16.2% in Group 2) and IFG (8.5% in Group 3 versus 5.0% in Group 2) were also substantially higher in Group 3 compared to Group 2 (P-value<0.001 for both comparisons). All the mean values for the RFs were higher in group 3 from group 2 except HDL-C. When Group 1 was used as a reference and calculated OR of any RF for any group 2–4 rather than group 1, OR for all RF in group 3 was higher from group 2.
Conclusion
The differences in frequency, means and OR of RFs between Groups 2 and 3 showed a differential impact of a high BMI or high PBF. Compared to PBF, BMI may be a better predictor for several RFs for CVD."

Underlying pathophysiology in diabetes mellitus leads to decrease in circulatory endothelial progenitor cells, resulting in diabetic macro-vascular and micro-vascular complications. Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor (PPAR) gamma analogues serves as an effective therapy for controlling blood sugar levels and preventing its complications. Reports of clinical trials and meta-analysis of clinical trial suggests the beneficial aspects of PPAR gamma therapy in increasing the number and function of circulating endothelial progenitor cells. This review highlights the pleotropic effect of PPAR gamma analogs, apart from their antidiabetic action via reduction of oxidative stress, increasing expression of eNOS, reducing level of miR 22, miR 222 levels and positive modulation of rapamycin/Protein kinase B/phosphoinoside3-kinase pathways, preventing the early apoptosis, enhanced mobility proliferation and transformation into mature endothelial cells. PPAR gamma therapy in diabetes regulates endothelial progenitor cells, reduces complications of diabetes like retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, deep vein thrombosis, and maintains the healthy vasculature."

abstract = "Aim
Inflammatory mediators like interleukin-6 (IL-6) and acute phase protein like C-reactive protein (CRP) are supposed to contribute to development of GDM, however clinical data supporting this hypothesis is limited. This study was designed to analyze the association of IL-6 and CRP with development of GDM in Indian females.
Methods
This case control study included pregnant women diagnosed as GDM (n = 53) and those having normal glucose tolerance (n = 50). Serum levels of IL-6 and CRP were analysed and correlated with various clinical parameters.
Results
Serum IL-6 levels were significantly high (p < 0.05) in GDM females as compared to control females. IL-6 levels correlated with pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), fasting blood sugar (FBS) and postprandial sugar (PPBS). Unlike IL-6, CRP levels did not show significant differences between GDM and control females. However, positive correlation of CRP levels with BMI, FBS and PPBS was observed.
Conclusion
High IL-6 levels in gestational diabetes may indicate a possible role for inflammation in pathophysiology of GDM."

To evaluate the predictive accuracy of surrogate measures of fasting insulin resistance/sensitivity like the Homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA –IR), Fasting glucose/insulin ratio (FG-IR), Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), and the 20/fasting C peptide x fasting plasma glucose [20/(FCP × FPG)] index in comparison to M value derived from hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp (HEC) studies in two birth weight based cohorts of Asian Indian males.
Methods
HEC studies were performed in non-diabetic Asian Indian males (n = 117), born of normal birth weight (n = 59, birth weight > 2.5 kgs) and low birth weight (n = 58, birth weight < 2.5 kgs). Anthropometry and biochemical analysis were done. Surrogate indices of fasting insulin resistance were calculated and data were analysed by Pearson's correlation and Random calibration model analysis.
Results
Amongst surrogate indices of fasting insulin resistance/sensitivity, the mean values for HOMA-IR, QUICKI, FG-IR, 20/(FCP × FPG) index and M value were similar between the two groups. Significant positive correlation was observed for FG-IR and QUICKI with M value (the gold standard measure of insulin sensitivity derived from HEC procedure) in the low birth weight cohort in contrast to the normal birth weight cohort, wherein no significant correlation was observed for any of the indices. Random calibration model analysis showed highest predictive accuracy for QUICKI in both the study groups.
Conclusion
The QUICKI index showed highest predictive accuracy in the normal birth weight and the low birth weight cohorts of Asian Indian males."

A total of 8 articles that met the inclusion criteria, published from inception until December 2018, were collected. Articles were searched using the following keywords and their possible combinations: Health Literacy, Illiteracy, Functional Health Literacy, Diabetes, Diabetes Mellitus, and Iran. The data were analyzed using meta-analysis and the random-effects model was used to obtain a pooled prevalence estimate along with its 95% confidence interval. Heterogeneity among the studies was assessed using the I2 statistic. Analyses were performed using STATA software, version 12. The overall prevalences of inadequate and borderline health literacy among Iranian patients with type 2 diabetes were 43.47% (95% CI: 31–55.95) and 26.34% (95% CI: 19.49–33.19), respectively. In addition, the prevalence of adequate health literacy among patients with type 2 diabetes was 29.72% (95% CI: 22.79–36.64). There was no significant relationship between health literacy with year of publication, sample size, and patients’ age. Inadequate health literacy is high (43.5%) among Iranian patients with type 2 diabetes.

Extensive literature search have been carried in regard with the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of DN, drug targets and updates on clinical trials, the consequences associated with DN and the potential biomarkers for diagnosis and prediction of DN are discussed in this review. DN is characterised by microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria, and morphological changes such as glomerular thickening, interstitial fibrosis, formation of nodular glomerulosclerosis and decreased endothelial cell fenestration. Besides, the involvement of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, inflammation and genetic factors are the key pathways in the progression of DN. In regard with drug development drugs targeted to epidermal growth factor, inflammatory cytokines, ACTH receptor and TGFβ1 receptors are in pipeline for clinical trials whereas, several drugs have also failed in phase III and phase IV of clinical trials due to lack of efficacy and severe adverse effect. The research on DN is limited with respect to its pathogenesis and drug development. Thus, a more detailed understanding of the pathogenesis of DN is very essential to progress in the drug development process."

One class of phytochemicals are phenols with (OH) group bounded to aromatic hydrocarbon group. The aim of this study was to review the anti-diabetic and anti-oxidant properties of important phenols.
Methods
This is a review study with ethic number (95s108) from AJUMS. About 450 articles (original, review,etc) been screened; 40 of them in the range of (1992–2017) were used due to their correlation to the study purpose. 28 of them were indexed by “Web of science (ISI)”, 24 of them indexed by pubmed and also 29 of them were indexed by scopus data center.
Findings
Phenols affect diabetes in different ways. CGA suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis through the inhibition of G6Pase and is also an insulin sensitizer that potentiates insulin action. Curcumin reduce insulin resistance so decrease AGE's products in diabetes mellitus. Hydroxytyrosol regulates the calcium channels which plays key role in insulin secretion. Resveratrol increase the stimulation of glucose uptake and insulin secretion. CGA has similar antioxidant activity as vitamin E and ellagic acid maybe is even more potent than vitamin E. curcumin inhibits lipid peroxidation and scavenge superoxide anion and hydroxyl radicals. The antioxidant activity of hydroxytyrosol protects pancreatic cells from damage and death. Treatment with resveratrol significantly decreases the level of glucosylated hemoglobin.
Conclusion
All these phytochemicals have potent antidiabetic and antioxidant effects in different ways beside their other effects like anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic properties in ellagic acid, or like anti-angiogenic and apoptogenic activities in curcumin. So we suggest further studies in the field of diabetes and antioxidation."

A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2015–2016 in Tehran, Iran, among females referred to the infertility clinic at Valie-Asr Reproductive Health Research Centre. Thirty-one patients with PCOS (according to the criteria of the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM)) and 29 healthy, normal cycling (NC) women of similar age, weight and height were enrolled. Anthropometric measurements, levels of resolvin D1, fasting insulin, glucose levels and insulin resistance index (HOMA) for each of the patients were determined.
Results
Intakes of macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, and total fat) and omega-3 PUFAs were higher in the PCOS group compared to the control group; also, the PCOS group had significantly higher resolvin D1, fasting insulin, glucose levels and HOMA when compared with the control group. Moreover, resolvin D1 correlated negatively with HOMA and fasting insulin levels among both the PCOS and control women.
Conclusion
PCOS is associated with insulin resistance. We showed that omega-3 PUFAs can increase the synthesis of resolvin D1. Resolvin D1 is involved in insulin sensitivity by affecting insulin signaling and inflammatory pathways. Therefore, it can be a contributing factor in reducing insulin resistance in PCOS patients."

abstract = "Background
Obesity-related to metabolic syndrome was associated with a greater risk for development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We aimed to assess the association between obesity and micro/macroalbuminuria in hypertensive patients with a poor estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2.
Methods
One hundred old patients (median age 79 years ± inter-quartile range 68–84.7) with manifested hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 85 mmHg) and a permanently poor eGFR for a duration time more than 3 months were enclosed. Albuminuria was defined as urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) ≥ 30 mg/gr and it was classified according to KDIGO 2012. The obesity was defined by a high body mass index (BMI>30 kg/m2). The waist circumference, HDL-C, triglycerides and serum glucose were measured. Chi-square tests and an adjusted model were performed.
Results
Chi-square tests showed significant association between classified albuminuria and both obesity and high serum triglycerides (x2 = 7.2, p = 0.02 and x2 = 8.3, p = 0.01 respectively). However, the adjusted model for the prediction of albuminuria showed that the presence of a high BMI was a non-significant risk factor, although diabetes mellitus and eGFR value were found to be significant risk factors (p = 0.03, OR = 4.3, 1.2–22.07 and p = 0.04, OR = 0.9, 0.9–1.007 respectively) adjusting to covariates including the high waist circumference.
Conclusion
Obesity defined by a high BMI was not found to be a significant risk factor for micro/macroalbuminuria in hypertensive patients with a poor estimated glomerular filtration rate, when diabetes mellitus and the low eGFR value act as confounders."

Fibrinogen has been implicated as a cause of atherosclerosis and its complications in patients with type 2 DM. We aimed to measure the plasma fibrinogen level in type 2 diabetics and to correlate it with the duration, type of treatment, HbA1c, smoking, lipid profile, diabetic retinopathy, hypertension and ischemic heart disease in comparison to control.
Methods
A case control single center study included 50 patients with type 2 DM between the ages of 35–85 y who were randomly selected from the medical units of Baghdad Teaching Hospital compared to 30 non-diabetics as a control. After taking verbal consents; plasma fibrinogen levels were estimated and correlated with aimed variables. Odds ratios with 95% CI were calculated and regression analysis was performed for correlations. P ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
There were statistically significant differences regarding total cholesterol, TG, and LDL between cases and control. Mean HbA1c of diabetics was 8.31 ± 1.75% (P < 0.001). Cases showed plasma fibrinogen of (4.01 ± 1.89 g/dL) compared to (2.79 ± 0.55 g/dL) of control (P < 0.001). ROC curve revealed that the AUC was (0.679 ± 0.06, 95%CI = 0.561–0.797, P < 0.008). The sensitivity and specificity of the test at cut off value of 3.05 g/dL were 0.62 and 0.567 respectively. There was a significant correlation between fibrinogen level and each of HbA1c (r = 0.497, P < 0.001) and TG (r = 0.359, P = 0.01).
Conclusions
HbA1c has a significant positive effect on plasma fibrinogen and it is important to measure plasma fibrinogen level in patients with type 2 DM."

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder that is well known for its long term serious complications. Proteinuria whether micro or macroproteinuria is one of these complications. Many studies has related proteinuria to other complications of diabetes as retinopathy and cardiovascular disease of diabetes, while the lungs of diabetic patients which is the largest organ in the body with a large macro and microvascular bed, has not been related to this complication.
Aim
The aim of the study was to find out whether proteinuria in diabetic patients can predict lung involvement.
Patients and methods
A comparative cross sectional study in which we compared the lung function of 100 type 2 diabetic patients with proteinuria with that of 100 type 2 diabetic patients without proteinuria. Proteinuria is measured in a random sample by “urine protein/urine creatinine ratio”. FEV1 and FVC were measured by spirometer.
Results
The results showed that patients with proteinuria had a high frequency of abnormal PFT (86%), while patients without proteinuria had a low frequency of abnormal PFT (11%).Also diabetic patients with proteinuria had lower FVC (72.9 ± 6.5 vs. 88.2 ± 8.2), than diabetic patients without proteinuria.
Conclusions
We concluded that diabetes mellitus causes a significant impairment in pulmonary function test. This impairment is significantly related with proteinuria."

Results
Prevalence of type 1 DM was 3.5% and of type 2 DM 96.5%. Prevalence of type 1 DM declined while of type 2 DM increased with age. No gender or residency differences were found between type 1 and type 2 DM. A total of 72.0% of subjects with type 2 DM were treated with oral antidiabetic drugs (OAD), 11.5% were treated with insulin and 7.1% were treated with both OAD and insulin. Internists specialized in DM were mainly doctors who started insulin treatment. Almost half of insulin naive subjects were skeptical towards insulin initiation and their main concern was the needle punch.

One of the most frequently encountered endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Recent studies have reported varied prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in women with PCOS. The aim of this study is to determine if the women with PCOS are at a higher risk of MetS.
Method
The present systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. To collect articles, we searched online databases of PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EBSCO and Google scholar search engine and the reference list of the retrieved articles using MeSH keywords of “metabolic syndrome”, “woman” and “polycystic ovary syndrome” without time limit until October 2018. Cochran's Q test and I2 Index were used to evaluate the heterogeneity among studies and the random effects model was used for combining the results. Data analysis was performed in STATA software version 11.1.
Result
Finally, 72 studies involving 10075 PCOS patients with an average age of 26.2 ± 5.01 years were included in the meta-analysis. The heterogeneity rate was high (I2 = 76.5%; p < 0.001) and the pooled estimate of the association between MetS and PCOS was significant (OR = 2.57, 95% CI: 2.18–3.02; P < 0.001).
Conclusion
According to the results, there is higher risk of MetS in women with PCOS. Therefore, diagnosis and treatment of MetS in women with PCOS may have a significant impact on this patients health and reduce the rate of mortality and morbidity."

The aim of the study was to assess the association of physical activity (PA) with the presence of diabetes related complications among Bangladeshi type 2 diabetic subjects.
Methods
This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Out Patient Department (OPD) of BIRDEM, Bangladesh. A group of 977 subjects were randomly selected and followed up. Diabetes was diagnosed following the WHO study group criteria. The level of PA was categorized into inactive/low (<150 min/week) and moderate-to-vigorous (≥150 min/week). The WHO recommended Asian criteria was used to identify general obesity. Retinopathy was detected by fundal photography, CKD by serum creatinine and hypertension was diagnosed clinically. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the associations of PA with diabetes related complications.
Results
Out of the 977 subjects investigated, 468 were male and 509 were female (mean ± SD of age, 56 ± 8 years). In the study subjects, 74% were either inactive or in low PA and of them 65.1% were overweight/obese. Analysis showed that inactive/low PA was associated with all the three diabetes related complications (p < 0.001)–hypertension, retinopathy, and nephropathy. Multivariate analysis showed that inactive/low level of PA was strongly associated with complications like retinopathy (p < 0.001) and hypertension (p = 0.01) in the female patients. It was also found to be highly associated with retinopathy (p < 0.001) among the male patients.
Conclusion
A large number of urban Bangladeshi population are involved only in low PA or remain inactive themselves, which is leading to obesity and it seems to have a strong association with diabetes related complications in this population."

Methods
A total of 100 healthy subjects and 200 patients diagnosed with different MetS components were enrolled in the study. Eligible patients were allocated into four groups (50 patients). Group1 include patients with 2 criteria of MetS components, group 2 with 3 criteria, group 3 with 4 criteria and group 4 had patients with 5 criteria.
Results
Regarding white blood cell indices, data showed that total leukocyte and neutrophil count as well as neutrophil/lymphocyte (N/L) ratio were significantly increased in all groups of MetS patients when compared to the healthy group. Additionally, platelets count, platelet distribution width (PDW), and main platelet volume (MPV) levels and platelets/lymphocyte (P/L) ratio were significantly higher in all patients with MetS as compared to the healthy subjects. Serum leptin concentration and leptin-to-adiponectin ratio (LAR) were elevated significantly, while adiponectin level was significantly diminished in all MetS groups when compared to the control.
Conclusion
leukocytes and platelets indices were associated with hyperleptinemia and hypoadiponectinemia as well as MetS components. The study also suggested the necessary role of leukocytes, platelet indices, and LAR as markers in early diagnoses of individuals with MetS components."

To evaluate the association of serum FGF21 with subclinical atherosclerosis and pulse wave velocity, a marker of arterial stiffness, in type 2 diabetes Egyptian patients.
Patients and methods
Fasting serum FGF21 was measured in 120 type 2 diabetes patients without clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (mean age 51.1 ± 7.7 years; 63.3 women). In addition to basic laboratory tests, serum adiponectin and ultrasonographic examination of CIMT, ankle brachial index (ABI) and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) were performed.
Results
Patients with subclinical atherosclerosis have higher serum FGF21 than those without (218 ± 66.8 pg/mL Vs 170 ± 43.1 pg/mL, P < 0.001). FGF21 correlated positively with CIMT and cfPWV (P < 0.001) regardless of patient gender. In logistic regression analysis, circulating FGF21 was found to be an independent predictor for subclinical atherosclerosis (P = 0.023) in addition to dyslipidemia, hypertension and adiponectin. FGF21 was also found to be an independent determinant of cfPWV in stepwise multiple regression analysis. ROC curve analysis was done and cutoff high risk FGF21 level of 184 pg/mL for the prediction of subclinical atherosclerosis with a sensitivity and specificity of 66.7%.
Conclusions
Serum FGF21 levels correlated with carotid intima media thickness and predict subclinical atherosclerosis. Serum FGF21 is also correlated positively with cfPWV and arterial stiffness in type 2 diabetes patients."

abstract = "Aims
Stage 0 Acute Charcot's Neuroarthropathy (ACN)in Type 2 Diabetes patients is a challenging diagnosis with subtle clinical features and normal appearing plain radiographs of the affected foot. Delay in diagnosis can lead to progression of disease and irreversible deformities. There is a paucity of data on Stage 0 ACN from India. The aim of this study was to assess clinical and radiological characteristics and treatment outcomes in Indian Type 2 Diabetes patients with Stage 0 ACN.
Materials and methods
A comparative, case-control study was carried out amongst patients attending the Integrated Diabetes Foot Clinic at a tertiary care South Indian hospital. During the 3-year study period, a total of 1811 patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus were screened. Of these, n = 10 patients with stage 0 ACN Charcot's arthropathy were identified based on clinical features and MRI imaging of the foot for confirmation of diagnosis. These were compared with an age and duration of diabetes-matched group of n = 50 patients without ACN as controls.
Results
Our study identified 10 patients (0.5%) with Stage 0 Acute charcot neuroarthropathy (ACN) in the study population. Those with ACN had higher BMI, poorer glycaemic control and greater degree of peripheral neuropathy (p < 0.05). Clinically relative lack of pain and infrared thermometric temperature difference >2 °C in the affected foot were the most significant findings, while MRI foot was useful in early detection of active and severe stage 0 disease. Total contact cast was the preferred initial offloading modality, with delay in initiating complete immobilization leading to worse outcomes.
Conclusions
This is the first study to highlight the characteristic features of Stage 0 ACN in Indian Type 2 Diabetes patients. Thorough clinical evaluation, infrared thermometry and radiological findigs on MRI foot leads to early disease detection. Complete offloading, preferably with total contact casts can prevent disease progression and chronic deformities."

For this study, data from the first phase of the cohort study of chronic diseases in the adults of Yazd city were used, which began in 2016. Data was recorded through a cohort trained team. To calculate PAR and its the Bayesian confidence interval were performed using software R (version 3.4.3).
Results
Of the 9967 subjects studied, age ≥30, 14.67% (n = 1432) has type 2 diabetes. The most common risk factors for diabetes were Inadequate physical activity and central obesity (WHR). The PAR for Inadequate physical activity of diabetes in women was 17.92%, in men 18.53, And PAR for WHR in women was 57.62%, in men 43.03.
Conclusions
In this study, age was the strongest determinant of diabetes. And then type 2 diabetes is mainly attributable to WHR, significantly more so in women than men. Therefore, central obesity probably should be considered as a major strategy for reducing incidence of type 2 diabetes."

Patients with diabetes are generally considered to have various risks with fasting. The recent pharmacologic and technical advances in the management of diabetes may have enabled these patients to practice safe fasting. The purpose of this review is to scientific evidence on the safety and efficacy of the current hypoglycemic agents during Ramadan.
Methods
An extensive Electronic search via PubMed and Google scholar was accomplished through using different search terms. The eligible studies were limited to only published Randomised controlled trial (RCT) and prospective observational studies from 2007 to 2018 on patients with all types of diabetes on any pharmacological management, who intended to fast in Ramadan.
Results and Conclusions
The current era witnessed a gradual shift in the management of these patients with diabetes who elected to fast in Ramadan, despite the variable health-related risks with fasting. Results from available RCTs and observational studies in patients with type 2 diabetes showed lower risk of hypoglycemia, similar or better efficacy for glycemic and weight control with SGLT2 inhibitors, incretin mimetics and the newer insulin analogues compared to Sulfonylurea. Gliclazide is a relatively safer option among all sulfonylurea. Patients requiring insulin did better with insulin analogues, especially the newer premixed formulation at the time of breaking fast compared to the former insulin formulation. Current commonly used newer hypoglycemic agents are generally safe during Ramadan, however, their safety in the higher risk diabetes patients is highly needed."

With the increased worldwide prevalence of hypertension among the underprivileged populations, fewerstudies have reported such risks among Indian tribes. In the context of high prevalence of undernutrition, no such study has examined hypertension among lean and underweight Indian tribal individuals separately.
Methods
We selected total samples of 1066 adult males and 1090 adult females in 20–60 years age-group cross-sectionally to examine the status of hypertension and its risks among nine major tribes in three Indian states; separate analyses for lean and underweight tribal individuals were done.
Results
Increased prevalence of hypertension (females, 14.2%; males, 9.3%) was observed among the tribes with the overall percentage of individuals at adversity (hypertensive + isolated hypertensive) at more than 20% (males 20.1%; females 26.5%). Age-group-wise prevalence showed a sharp rise in the prevalence of hypertension in the 40 + year individuals; additionally, this rise was alarming among females. Undernutrition was observed to be a potential risk factor as a remarkable prevalence of hypertension was observed among the undernourished (approximately 9%) and lean tribal participants (12%). Underweight females were observed to be at higher risk. Tribal statuses were observed to be alarming than the national trends due to their very low average BMI along with high average SBP. A curvilinear prevalence of hypertension was observed while comparing through both the nutritional extremes.
Conclusion
The increased prevalence and risks of hypertension in the background of lean and underweight status of Indian tribes indicates their epidemiological transition burdened with alarming cardio-metabolic health risks that warrant an early and consistent surveillance."

Diabetic foot ulcer is one of the common complications of diabetes disease that is costly and difficult to treat. This problem can lead to morbidity and even mortality. Ozone is a gas that can optimize cellular metabolism and, because of its antioxidant and antibacterial effects, can help the better healing of diabetic foot ulcer.
Method
Two hundred patients, aged 18–85 with diabetic foot ulcers ranging from grade 1 to 4 according to Wagner classification in two groups were studied. Group 1 was treated by full ozone therapy besides the standard regular DFU treatment while group two just was received routine diabetic foot care. Wound size, wound grade, healing time, Fasting blood sugar and inflammatory biomarker before and after treatment were checked.
Results
All patients have had complete wound closure in the ozone group. The mean age of the patients included in the results was 59.03 ± 12.593 and 53.5 ± 10.212 for ozone group and control group. The baseline average surface area of ulcers was 13.41 ± 14.092 cm2 (range 1–70 cm2) in ozone group and 12.72 ± 0.911 (range 1_64 cm2) in the control group. Average healing time was 69.44 ± 36.055 days (range 15–180 days), which is significantly lower than the median healing time measured in the control group and some previous studies.
Conclusion
Our study results support the efficacy of ozone therapy especially in its comprehensive use in DFU healing and reduction in the chances of infection and amputation."

Methods
Patients using insulin between the age of 18–90 years were selected to complete the MedTake questionnaire, to evaluate the indication, dosage, regimen and drug interaction. The MedTake test was employed. For each medicine, the test was scored as the percentage of correct actions and compared with printed instructions one single researcher downloaded all the data was from the municipality's computerized system.
Results
The median age of recruits was 60.2 ± 14.3 and MedTake test scores were low 60.3 ± 20. One hundred patients missed the correct dose question, 40 missed why they were prescribed the drug, indication and 65 missed the therapeutic regimen. These diabetes patients did not know the DDIs between insulin combined with other medicines. Drugs that had more interaction with insulin were: acetylsalicylic acid (40%), enalapril (18%), losartan (32%) and hydrochlorothiazide (23%).

This study was undertaken to inspect the preponderance of multidrug-resistant (MDR) microorganisms in microbial infected diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) in north Egypt. Moreover, their later impact on the patients and previous antibiotic therapies were taken into consideration.
Methods
To accomplish this goal, twenty-two of diabetic foot patients with purulent wounds were enrolled in this prospective study. These wounds were swabbed and the antibiotics susceptibility patterns of most virulent bacteria and yeast were studied. Furthermore, bacterial and yeast strains were identified using 16S rRNA and 16S rRNA nucleotide sequences, respectively, and following their phenotypic characteristics employing the VITEK 2 system.
Results
Microbial profiles showed a predominance of monomicrobial infections (77.3%), while polymicrobial infections were found in 22.7%. A total of 24 bacterial isolates (15 Gram-positive and 9 Gram-negative) and four yeast isolates were perceived. Four bacteria were selected based on their resistance toward more than six of empirical antibiotics. They were identified and deposited in GenBank as Acinetobacter baumanni MT3 (KY421195), Staphylococcus aureus MT1 (KY421197), Klebsiella pneumonia MT2 (KY421196), and Staphylococcus aureus MT4 (KY421198). On the other hand, one strain belonged to yeast was opted and identified as Candida albicans MT5 (MG851796).
Conclusion
These findings might effectively help to avert the severe complications of diabetic foot infections (DFIs) besides our endeavours to find new antimicrobial wound dressings."

abstract = "Aim
To validate bioimpedance based predictive equations for fat free mass (FFM) against DEXA and to derive a novel birth weight based predictive equation for FFM in a birth weight based cohort of healthy Asian Indian men.
Methodology
Whole body composition was done using DEXA and bioimpedance in 117 young Asian Indian men, born of normal birth weight (n = 59, birth weight ≥2.5 kg) or low birth weight (n = 58, birth weight < 2.5 kg). Predictive accuracy of 11 different bioimpedance based equations for FFM was evaluated using Pearson's correlation analysis and the root of mean squared prediction error (RMSE) analysis.
Results
The mean FFM (on DEXA) and total lean mass & impedance index (on bioimpedance) were significantly higher in the low birth weight cohort. Significantly higher body fat percentage was noted on bioimpedance, for the normal birth weight cohort, but not on DEXA. In addition, the mean values of predicted FFM were significantly higher in the low birth weight cohort for 9 different predictive equations. Specifically, the mean FFM values obtained using the predictive equations of Schaefer et al., Hoot cooper et al. and Hughes et al. were in close agreement with the actual FFM values on DEXA. A novel predictive equation (CMC equation) for FFM based on birth weight was derived. FFM = 32.637 + (−0.222*age) + (−32.51*waist-to-hip ratio) + (0.33*body mass index) + (1.58 * 1 or 2 (1 = normal birth weight, 2 = low birth weight) + (0.510*waist circumference).
Conclusions
Our study findings substantiate the validity of Bio-impedance analysis (BIA) as a reliable and noninvasive tool for estimating body composition measures in birth-weight based cohorts of Asian Indian males. Further, we have devised a novel BIA-based predictive equation that can be useful in larger epidemiological studies to look at alterations in body fat in this cohort."

There is currently limited data published on the prognostic factors and prevalence of diabetic eye disease in children and young people (CYP) with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), yet diabetic retinopathy remains one of the commonest causes of blindness in young adults. The aim of this study was to determine the risk and prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and to evaluate the risk factors associated with diabetic retinopathy in CYP with T1DM.
Methods
All CYP with Type 1 diabetes between 12 and 18 years of age, registered with the regional diabetic retinopathy screening programme were evaluated from 2012 to 2013 in four diabetes units within the north west region of the United Kingdom. Patients who had evidence of diabetic retinopathy were reviewed to identify risk factors for presence or absence of diabetic retinopathy.
Results
237 patients between the ages 12–18 years were included in the. The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was 11%. Out of 27 patients with evidence of diabetic retinopathy, 44% were reported as background changes and 56% had pre-proliferative DR. Significant risk factors for diabetic retinopathy disease in the population using univariate analyses were duration of diabetes, puberty, age at diagnosis and mean HbA1c in the preceding 12 months. Multivariate logistic regression analysis found age of diagnosis (p = 0.04) and mean HbA1c as significant independent risk factors for presence of diabetic retinopathy (p = 0.02).
Conclusions
The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy in this paediatric population was 11%. Early age at diagnosis and poor metabolic control are independent risk factors for diabetic retinopathy."

This study has been conducted on 8652 adults aged 20–70 years participated in Yazd Health Study (YAHS). Data regarding dietary habits, socio-demographic characteristics and history of chronic illnesses were collected via questionnaire. Anthropometric parameters were measured using a scale and body analyzer. Odds ratio of obesity were assessed using a Binary Logistic Regression test.
Results
Study participants consisted of 49.6% men and 50.4% women. The prevalence of general and abdominal obesity in this population was 25.9 and 45.3%, respectively. Our analysis revealed that subjects who drank carbonated drinks ≥3 times/week had significantly higher odds of general and abdominal obesity compared to participants never did so (OR 1.89; 95%CI: 1.37–2.61, OR 1.11; 95%CI: 1.50–2.04) and those ate fast food more than 4 times a month had higher odds of abdominal obesity (OR 1.51; 95%CI: 1.12–2.03). The results also pointed that intake of low fat dairy products was inversely associated with general obesity (OR 0.79; 95% CI 0.63–0.98) and abdominal obesity (OR 0.66; 95% CI 0.54–0.82) when compared with full fat dairy products.

Three criteria viz., National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) criteria, International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria and Harmonized criteria for MetS were employed to assess the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in this region, their concordance with respect to this population was recorded.
Methods
The cross-sectional study involved the people, who had attended the Diabetes clinic at the Centre for Translational Research, Jiwaji University during 2015-2017. A total of 1190 participants within the age group of 20–79 years of either gender were included in the study. Anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, blood glucose and lipid profile of all subjects were assessed. Student's ‘t’ test, Kappa statistics and Binary logistic regression model were used to analyze the data.
Results
The percentage of prevalent MetS was found to be 72.7, 50.2 and 53.9 following Harmonized criteria, NCEP ATPIII and IDF criteria respectively. The prevalence was found to be maximum in centrally obese female population, aged between 51 and 60 years with the presence of hyperglycemia and reduced HDL– C. Harmonized and IDF criteria showed good agreement (κ 0.85). Regression analysis showed that, high body mass index, hypertension and dyslipedimia were the most critical predictive risk factors of MetS.
Conclusions
Maximum prevalence of MetS was recorded when the Harmonized criteria was followed. A good agreement was observed between Harmonized vs. IDF criteria. MetS if detected early especially in apparently healthy subjects; paves way for preventive measures to be designed in order to avert the incidence of diabetes and other risks related to cardio vascular disease."

abstract = "Background
The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) has been growing rapidly in the world. It is smashing particularly the lower and middle income countries (LMICs) severely. Due to its acute and chronic complications many lives have fallen under its bad shadow. Therefore, we aimed to review the existing evidence on major types and specific complications of DM among diabetic patients in Ethiopia.
Methods
Both relevant quantitative and qualitative studies, conducted after 1990s, investigated and reported DM and complications from MEDLINE/PubMed, CINAHL, SCOPUS, DAOJ and Cochrane library databases were explored. In addition, System for Information for grey literature in Europe (SINGLE) database was investigated for the existence of unpublished grey literature. Total of 161 titles were identified and 17 studies met the inclusion criteria. Findings were narrated descriptively.
Results
In this review 17 studies were included, and both macro and micro complications were summarized. Among the diabetic complications retinopathy, nephropathy, metabolic syndrome, impotence and depression were the main findings among diabetic patients in Ethiopia.
Conclusion
The burden of DM and its microvascular and macrovascular complications have been increasing among diabetic patients in Ethiopia. The increased duration of the diseases, lower socio economic level, existence of other complications, old age attributed the diabetic complications. Therefore, close monitoring and follow up of diabetic patients is necessary to reduce the incidence and prevalence of diabetic complications among the patients."

abstract = "Diabetes mellitus is the most common endocrine disease, characterized by chronic hyperglycemia. The hyperglycemic milieu leads to endothelial injury in blood vessels of variant size, which results in microangiopathy and macroangiopathy (atherosclerosis). Consequential ischemia of nerves and hyperglycemia by itself lead to nerve degeneration and generalized neuropathy, affecting most often the sensory peripheral nerves and the autonomic nervous system. Auditory, vestibular and olfactory sensorium may be compromised by DM. People with DM have an increased susceptibility to infection, as a result of neutrophil dysfunction and impaired humoral immunity. Therefore DM predisposes to certain infectious diseases, such as fungal sinusitis or malignant otitis externa, which are rare in general population. Recovery from infections or from injuries may be compromised by coexisting DM. In this review we discuss complications of DM in the head and neck region. Otolaryngologists and general practitioners should be alert to specific conditions related to DM and be minded of the relevant complications and consequences."

Despite epidemiological studies worldwide have documented erectile dysfunction (ED) as a major complication of type 2 diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in men, only limited research reported on determinants of ED in this population. The study aimed at examining the association of ED with dyslipidaemia in T2DM patients.
Methods
The study enrolled 813 consecutive eligible adult male T2DM patients attending the endocrinology departments of a tertiary teaching hospital in Bangladesh. Sexual function was assessed using modified International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) in face-to-face interview and collected along with sociodemographic information. Diabetes and lipid profile and treatment history were collected from patient's treatment records. Association of ED with dyslipidaemia was assessed using multivariable logistic regression adjusting for potential confounders.
Result
Prevalence of ED among the T2DM patients was very high (72.7%), of which around half had moderated-to-severe ED. Odds of having dyslipidaemia among T2DM patients with ED is 2.3 times higher than those without. The odds increased by approximately 3 fold for an abnormal High Density Lipoprotein level and by 2.7 fold for abnormal Low Density Lipoprotein.
Conclusion
Dyslipidaemia was associated with increased ED risk among T2DM. Abnormal lipoprotein level particularly were found to pose greater risk."

abstract = "Background
Diabetic Peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is the most distressing complication of diabetic population leading to loss of sensation, pain, and amputation. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been used to manage nerve injuries as it holds the potential to induce a biostimulatory effect with no side effects. Hence we planned to study the biochemical effect and therapeutic outcomes of LLLT on patients with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy as a preliminary work.
Materials and methods
Pre-posttest analysis was done on 40 patients diagnosed with DPN confirmed using 10 g Monofilament test and Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI). Vibration sensation and pain measured by Vibration perception threshold (VPT) and Numeric pain rating scale (NPRS). All patients were given LLLT (3.1 J/cm2) on plantar and dorsal of the foot for 10 days. Serum samples were collected at baseline and 4 weeks after LLLT to estimate Vitamin D and Magnesium and compared the results.
Results
There was a significant increase in Vitamin D and Magnesium levels after LLLT. We observed a considerable improvement in the quality of life after LLLT demonstrated by a decrease in VPT and MNSI and a reduction in NPRS in DPN patients.
Conclusion
In this study, we found that LLLT improved the QL and hence may be a useful therapeutic option in treating peripheral neuropathic pain in type 2 diabetic patients. The progress in the serum Magnesium and Vit. D levels were proportional to the QL and may be a good indicator of the prognosis of DPN after LLLT."

abstract = "Background
Diabetes is among the most prevalent diseases worldwide, of all the affected individuals a significant proportion of the population remains undiagnosed due to lack of specific symptoms early in this disorder and inadequate diagnostics. Diabetes and its associated sequela, i.e., comorbidity are associated with microvascular and macrovascular complications. As diabetes is characterized by an altered metabolism of key metabolites and regulatory pathways. Metabolic phenotyping can provide us with a better understanding of the unique set of regulatory perturbations that predispose to diabetes and its associated complication/comorbidities.
Methodology
The present study utilizes the analytical platform NMR spectroscopy coupled with Random Forest statistical analysis to identify the discriminatory metabolites in diabetes (DB = 38) vs. diabetes-related complication (DC = 35) along with the healthy control (HC = 50) subjects. A combined and pairwise analysis was performed to identify the discriminatory metabolites responsible for class separation. The perturbed metabolites were further rigorously validated using t-test, AUROC analysis to examine the statistical significance of the identified metabolites.
Results
The DB and DC patients were well discriminated from HC. However, 15 metabolites were found to be significantly perturbed in DC patients compared to DB, the identified panel of metabolites are TCA cycle (succinate, citrate), methylamine metabolism (trimethylamine, methylamine, betaine), -intermediates; energy metabolites (glucose, lactate, pyruvate); and amino acids (valine, arginine, glutamate, methionine, proline, and threonine).
Conclusion
The 1H NMR metabolomics may prove a promising technique to differentiate and predict diabetes and its complication on their onset or progression by determining the altered levels of the metabolites in serum."

Subclinical inflammation and presence of almost all indicators of systemic inflammation are found in type 2 diabetic patients. Such a systemic and subclinical inflammatory process can be characterized by elevated circulating levels of inflammatory markers.
Aim
To study the state of subclinical inflammation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and establish a correlation between glycemic control and inflammatory markers.
Methods
This research included 90 subjects divided into 2 groups; Group A: 70 patients with type 2 diabetes and Group B: 20 Age and sex matched people as the control group. All patients were clinically examined, had laboratory investigations including; fasting and 2 h postprandial blood sugar, HbA1c, serum ferritin., high sensitivity C-reactive protein hs-CRP, kidney functions tests, liver function tests, complete blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and antinuclear antibody.
Results
The estimated levels of ESR, FBS, serum ferritin, hs-CRP and HbA1c in T2DM were 10.69 ± 3.05, 186.01 ± 92.21, 6005.2 ± 2639.83, 155.75 ± 73.95, 7.5 ± 3.23, respectively.

We aimed to compare C-peptide levels & measures of insulin resistance in non-lean & non-obese Asian Indian patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) vs. non-lean, non-diabetic controls and to correlate with anthropometric measures, volumes of abdominal adipose tissue depots, pancreas, & liver span.
Methods
Non-lean, non-obese (BMI >19 and < 25 kg/m2) Asian Indian patients with T2DM, (cases n, 87), diagnosed within one year, on metformin mono therapy, were compared to BMI-matched non-diabetic subjects (controls, n, 37). Measures of glycaemia, insulin and C-peptide levels (fasting and post-prandial), lipid profile, and hepatic transaminases were analysed. Abdominal adipose tissue volumes [subcutaneous & intra-abdominal], pancreatic volume and liver span were assessed using 1.5 Tesla MRI scan.
Results
In cases, the mean values of HbA1c, fasting and post prandial insulin and C-peptide levels, and 3 measures of insulin resistance were significantly higher than controls, but not for HOMA-B. Higher fasting C-peptide levels correlated significantly with HOMA-IR (r = 0.42, p < 0.001), Fasting Insulin Resistance Index (r = 0.42, p < 0.001), Bennett's Index (r = 0.38, p < 0.05), and volumes of SCAT and IAAT only in cases.

Methods
Stress questionnaires - Presumptive Stressful Life Events Scale (PSLES), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Sense of Coherence (SOC) - were administered to 500 Newly Detected Diabetes Mellitus (NDDM) cases and 500 Normal Glucose Tolerance (NGT) controls recruited following 75 g OGTT. Assessment of stress was completed before the diagnosis of diabetes was revealed to them.
Results
PSLES and PSS scores were significantly higher and SOC score was significantly lower in NDDM subjects compared to those with NGT. PSLES and PSS correlated positively with anthropometric parameters (waist circumference, BMI), glycemic parameters (FPG, 2 hPG, A1C) and HOMA-IR and inversely with HOMA-β whereas SOC correlated inversely with glycemic parameters (FPG, 2 hPG, A1C) and HOMA-IR and positively with HOMA-β. In stepwise logistic regression analysis, SOC emerged as the strongest independent predictor of diabetes (OR: 0.774) after HOMA-IR (OR: 1.621) and BMI (OR: 1.288).

Mean age, fasting plasma glucose, and body mass index were 55 ± 21 years, 93 ± 29 mg/dL, and 23.4 ± 4.6 kg/m2, respectively. Multivariate regression analysis after age and sex adjustment showed a negative association of serum FT4 with body mass index (β = −0.070, p = 0.001) and the relationship was still significant after subjects with positive anti-thyroperoxidase were excluded (β = −0.068, p = 0.003). In contrast, serum TSH was positively associated with body mass index (β = 0.052, p = 0.012). Moreover, serum FT4 was positively associated with fasting plasma glucose levels (β = 0.097, p < 0.001).
Conclusions
Small variations of serum TSH and FT4 within the reference range may contribute to the differences in metabolic indexes such as body mass index and fasting plasma glucose."

abstract = "Aim
Data on prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) among US adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are limited. The aim of this study was to provide such estimates for T2D, both overall and in those with CVD.
Materials and methods
Using the NHANES 2007–2014 data, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of an adult sample with diagnosed and undiagnosed T2D, aged ≥18 years. CVD was defined based on self-reported personal interview data on a broad range of health conditions—congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, angina, stroke, or heart attack. T2D was defined as diagnosed T2D (self-reported provider diagnosis) and undiagnosed T2D (FPG ≥126 mg/dL or HbA1c ≥ 6.5% without self-reported diagnosis). Participants who started insulin within a year of T2D diagnosis, or were pregnant at the time of health examination were excluded. Appropriate sample weights were used to provide a national estimate.
Results
The prevalence of moderate to severe renal impairment based on eGFR below 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 among T2D was 18.0%. The prevalence of mild renal impairment was 36.9%: 28.3% with UACR<30 mg/g, 7.0% with UACR ≥30–300 mg/g and 1.6% with UACR >300 mg/g. For T2D and CVD subgroup, the prevalence was 33.6% for moderate to severe renal impairment and 42.8% for mild renal impairment.
Conclusions
This study confirms the high prevalence of CKD in patients with multiple comorbidities: T2D and CVD. It also provides estimates of the prevalence of CKD categories based on KDIGO 2012 classification for US adults with T2D."

Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL) as the residual lipid plays a crucial role in cardiovascular complications and type 2 diabetes. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship of OxLDL with the conventional risk markers and to find the association of OxLDL with the risk of development of type 2 diabetes in middle-aged (30–50 years) Asian Indians.
Materials and methods
A total of 78 type 2 diabetes patients and 78 age-matched controls were recruited. The serum OxLDL concentration was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Other anthropometric and biochemical measures were also carried out. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the association of OxLDL and OxLDL to non-oxidized lipoproteins with the occurrence of type 2 diabetes.
Results
OxLDL was significantly higher in type 2 diabetes cases than controls (p < 0.001) even though there was no significant difference in LDL cholesterol (LDL-c) between type 2 diabetes patients and controls. OxLDL correlated significantly with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). OxLDL did not show any significant correlation with LDL-c. Multiple logistic regression showed a significant association of OxLDL, OxLDL/LDL-c and OxLDL/HDL-c with type 2 diabetes (p < 0.001). LDL-c showed no association with type 2 diabetes. ROC-AUC curve analyses showed OxLDL/HDL-c to have highest discriminatory power for type 2 diabetes (AUC: 0.710 with 95% CI: 0.629–0.791, p < 0.001).
Conclusion
Our findings highlight the possibly more attention has to be given to OxLDL for managing lipids and diabetes progression as well as reducing cardiac risk in middle-aged type 2 diabetes patients."

Waist circumference (WC) is an indicator of adiposity; particularly visceral fat, cardiometabolic risk factors and related morbidity. The aim of this study was to determine the attribution of WC to increased carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and circulating levels of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction in schoolchildren.
Methods
A total of 122 children (61 boys and 61 girls) aged 10–15 years were distributed into three groups: (i) the lower smoothed sex- and age-specific WC (LWC) group (ii) the middle smoothed sex- and age-specific WC (MWC) group, and (iii) the higher smoothed sex- and age-specific WC (HWC) group. Measurements of cIMT using high-resolution B-mode ultrasound, lipemic profile, blood pressure, serum proinflammatory cytokines and soluble adhesion molecules were performed.
Results
Mean measured values in the HWC and/or MWC groups showed significantly higher values (p ≤ 0.05) of cIMT (mm), total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), blood pressure, interlukien-6 (IL-6), and interlukien-1 beta (IL-1β), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1(ICAM-1) and E-selectin, and significantly lower values of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) as compared to the LWC group. Using multiple linear regression analysis of WC-SDS adjusted for BMI-SDS with the studied subclinical atherosclerosis risk, WC-SDS was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) associated with the variation in HDL (R2 = −0.12), LDL (R2 = 0.36), IL-6 (R2 = 0.26), and VCAM-1 (R2 = 0.26).
Conclusions
Higher WC is positively associated with atherosclerosis risk factors including increased cIMT, a state of dyslipidemia, higher blood pressure and circulating levels of inflammation and adhesion molecules among schoolchildren. Waist circumference seems to be useful for the prediction of subclinical atherosclerosis in schoolchildren."

Method
A cross-sectional study from April to June 2017, included 330 pharmacies in Khartoum state. The sampling technique was done by two methods using stratified and systematic methods for seven localities of Khartoum State. The community pharmacists were assessed in their knowledge about Medication regimen adjustment (MRA), diabetes risk stratification and the condition in which the fasting diabetic patient have to stop their fast.
Results
The total response rate was 311(94.2%), and the females were 203(65.3%). Pharmacists mean age was 27.6 (SD = 5.9), ranged between 21-62 years. Importantly, more than 75% of the Pharmacists have sufficient knowledge of both identifying high-risk individuals and whether they need to break their fasting. The practice questions answered correctly by more than 80% of pharmacists in relation to monitor blood glucose level, undergo meal planning to avoid hypoglycemia and dehydration during prolong fasting hours and to undergo meal choices to avoid postprandial hyperglycemia. Importantly, 56.9% community pharmacists advised individuals with diabetes about physical activity. The barriers that hindering the proper counseling was attributed to the Lack of knowledge (71.4%). MRA was reported as highly important by (56.6%) and extremely important by (39.2%). The confidence of knowledge about MRA was reported by 52.1%.

The rate of diabetes mellitus is increasing globally as a result of increased levels of blood glucose. The elevated blood glucose level results due to impairment in the production and action of insulin. An increase in glycated hemoglobin is associated with higher blood glucose levels that further results in nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the study has investigated the correlation between HbA1c and creatinine levels among diabetic patients, suffering from foot ulcerations.

Sirtuins regulate energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity through their ability to act as energy sensors and regulators in several metabolic tissues.
Aim
To evaluate the expression levels of sirtuin genes SIRT1, SIRT2, SIRT3 and SIRT6 and their target genes (PPAR-α, PGC1-α, NRF1, DGAT1, PPAR-γ and FOXO3a) in subcutaneous adipose tissue collected from individuals with normoweight, overweight and obesity.
Methods
Adipose tissue samples, obtained by lipoaspiration during liposuction surgery, were processed to obtain RNA, which was reverse-transcribed to cDNA. Then, we measured the expression levels of each gene by qPCR.
Results
We found differences in the mRNA expression of SIRT1, SIRT2, SIRT3 and SIRT6 and their target genes (PPAR-α, PGC1-α, NRF1, DGAT1, PPAR-γ and FOXO3a) in adipose tissue from overweight or obese subjects when compared to normoweight subjects. All genes analyzed, except SIRT2, showed correlation with BMI.
Conclusions
Our findings in human subcutaneous adipose tissue show that increased body mass index modifies the expression of genes encoding sirtuins and their target genes, which are metabolic regulators of adipose tissue. Therefore, these could be used as biomarkers to predict the ability of adipose tissue to gain mass of adipose tissue."

Small for gestational age (SGA) is associated with increased rates of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Adiponectin secreted from adipose tissue is implicated in the etiology of death and illness during infancy. SGA is also a likely risk factor for the development of metabolic and clinical complications in adulthood. The present study was performed to determine whether SGA neonates and healthy controls show differences in blood adiponectin concentration at birth.
Methods
Databases were searched to identify English-language studies providing the numbers of SGA neonates, the numbers of healthy controls, and the means and standard deviations (SDs) of blood adiponectin concentrations at birth in both groups. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS). A meta-analysis was performed to summarize the standardized mean differences (SMDs) in blood adiponectin concentration between SGA neonates and healthy controls.
Results
The results summarized from five good quality (i.e., NOS score ≥ 5) studies involving 253 neonates showed that blood adiponectin concentration was significantly lower in SGA neonates than in healthy controls (P = 0.016), and the effect was moderate (i.e., SMD = 0.4–0.7).

Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a serious microvascular complication of a longstanding hyperglycemia. This study aims to evaluate whether urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and urinary Interleukin-18 possess a better diagnostic value than albumin creatinine ratio in assessing the severity of nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Material & methods
Ninety participants diagnosed with T2DM were recruited and they were divided into three study groups according to their albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR): (Normoalbuminuria group, Microalbuminuria group, and Macroalbuminuria group). A matching of Ninety healthy subjects were included as controls. Blood and urine samples were collected to measure various markers of glycemic control and kidney function.
Results
IL-18 levels were not changed significantly between all study groups (P > 0.05), despite a significant positive correlation between IL-18 and urinary albumin levels. NGAL levels were significantly increased in Microalbuminuria group and Macroalbuminuria group as compared to the control and Normoalbuminuria groups. NGAL was also positively correlated with urinary albumin and ACR, but negatively correlated with the age and body mass index. Receiver Operating Characteristic curves revealed that for early detection of DN, the best cutoff values to discriminate DN and diabetic without nephropathy groups were ˃ 21.4 ng/ml for NGAL (94.67 sensitivity, 26.67% specificity), ≤0.34 pg/mL for IL-18 (72% sensitivity, 53.33% specificity), and ˃29.8 mg/g for ACR (80% sensitivity, 100% specificity).

MSP1A and MSP1B polymorphic sites located in the GH genomic area have been found associated with GH response to insulin stimulation, with familiar short stature and with age at onset of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). These observations prompted us to search for a possible relationship between stature and age at onset of the disease.
Methods
We have reexamined the data of 272 subjects with T2D mellitus.
Results
There is a highly significant negative correlation between stature and age at onset in non obese females (p < 0.001) but not in obese females and in males. In non obese females with stature within the first quartile the mean age at onset is 62 years while in those with a stature greater than the first quartlile the mean age at onset is 52 yesrs (p < 0.001). No difference is observed in obese females and males.
Conclusions
These observations suggest the existence of different mechanisms underlying susceptibility to T2D. In addition to the well known increased risk due to obesity, endocrine dysfunctions related to genetic variability within the GH genomic area could represent another mechanism operating in non obese females. A cluster of non obese women characterized by short stature and late onset of diabetes seems to be separated by this mechanism from other women."

abstract = "Background
Meta-analysis is useful for combining the results of different studies statistically to confirm genuine associations in genetics. Based on earlier reports, we aimed to investigate the association between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) genetic variants identified in a previous meta-analysis in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in an Indian woman.
Material and methods
In this study, 137 pregnant women with GDM and 150 pregnant women were selected on the basis of their serum glucose levels. The six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of different genes studied had known involvement in pancreatic β-cell function, particular pathways linked to T2DM, and other biological functions. Genomic DNA was isolated from the 287 women for polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses.
Results
The rs7903146, rs13266634, rs2283228, rs5210 and rs179881 SNPs were found to be positively associated with GDM when calculated for genotype and allele frequencies (p < 0.05), but rs680 (ApaI) variant did not show statistically significant association (p = 0.31). The rs7903146, rs2283228, rs5210 and rs680 variants showed a strong association with oral glucose tolerance test values.
Conclusion
The SNPs studied in this GDM had the same role as those identified in a previous T2DM meta-analysis, and showed positive association in the Indian women. Meta-analyses should be implemented to assess the IGF2 gene in GDM subjects."

Specifically, normoalbuminuric chronic kidney disease (NA-CKD), which is characterized by a decline in the glomerular filtration rate in the absence of a preceding or accompanying elevation of albuminuria, has become a widely prevalent variant of renal impairment in diabetes. Diabetic women and nonsmoking individuals with better glycemic control have a better chance of preserving normoalbuminuria, even in the case of declining renal function. The wide use of renin-angiotensin system blockers, advances in antihyperglycemic, antihypertensive, and hypolipidemic therapy, and smoking cessation are suspected to be responsible for an increasing proportion of NA-CKD among diabetic subjects with renal impairment. Significant differences in the sets of risk factors, renal morphology, comorbidity, and outcomes were found between the albuminuric and normoalbuminuric CKD patterns. NA-CKD, even if a more favorable option in terms of the risk of end-stage renal disease, is clearly associated with cardiovascular disease and its risk factors. The presence of NA-CKD in patients with diabetes increases the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death. The study of the molecular pathways, clinical course, and outcomes of NA-CKD in diabetic subjects and the search for more specific diagnostic and treatment options are challenges for future research."

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide that requires a person with diabetes to make a multitude of daily self-management decisions. This study sought to evaluate the effectiveness of a self-management program based on PRECEDE-PROCEDE model on self-management behaviors in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Methods
This experimental study was conducted on 86 diabetic patients referred to the diabetes clinics in Ardabil, Iran, in 2017. From a total of 326 patients with diabetes medical records in those clinics, 86 (26.3%) patients agreed to participate in this study. They were then randomly divided into two groups; intervention (n = 43) and control (n = 43). The intervention group received eight sessions of PRECEDE model-based self-management education program while the control group did not receive any education program. Both groups were assessed at baseline and six months after the intervention.
Results
The mean age of the participants was 55.69 ± 12.04 years (range 32–86 years). 41 patients were men, and 45 were women. The mean time since the first diagnosis of diabetes was 8.6 years (SD = 5.2), and the mean BMI of the patients was 31.63 (SD = 4.20). At baseline, 35.01% of patients had poor self-management behaviors. All PRECEDE variables, including predisposing factors (knowledge, attitude, and self-efficacy), enabling factors, and reinforcing factors, as well as self-management behaviors, were significantly improved in those of intervention group after the education program.
Conclusion
Self-management education program substantially enhances the self-management behaviors in patients with type two diabetes."

In type 1 diabetes mellitus and autoimmune thyroiditis, there seems to be common genetic loci. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether patients with type 1 diabetes had increased prevalence of autoimmune thyroiditis, and which factors were influencing the co-existence of these two clinical entities.
Patients and methods
A cohort of 256 patients, 18–79 years of age, a median duration of diabetes of 20 years and a mean follow-up duration of 13 years were included in the study.
Results
Of the 256 patients with type 1 diabetes, 150 participants (58.6%) were women and 106 (41.4%) were men. One hundred and fifty-nine patients (64.6%) did not have autoimmune thyroiditis, whereas 97 (35.4%) had autoimmune thyroiditis, as was documented by the presence of anti-thyroid antibodies (anti-TPO and/or anti-TG). Of the 97 patients with both diabetes type 1 and autoimmune thyroiditis, 64 (66%) were women and 33 (34%) were men. Among the 97 patients who had both diabetes type 1 and autoimmune thyroiditis, 87 had abnormal levels of both anti-TPO and anti-TG, while 7 patients had subnormal levels of solely anti-TPO and only 3 patients had abnormal levels of only anti-TG.
Conclusions
There was a slightly higher prevalence of autoimmune thyroiditis among our patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Also, female sex was predominant, when compared to male sex, among the adult participants of this study. Therefore, regular screening of thyroid function and thyroid autoantibodies may be suggested for all patients with type 1 diabetes."

To evaluate the association between high triglyceride/HDL-cholesterol (TG/HDL-C) ratio and insulin resistance (IR) or hyperinsulinemia after oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in normal-weight healthy adults.
Methods
We carried out an analytical cross-sectional study in euthyroid non-diabetic adults, who attended the outpatient service of a private clinic in Lima-Peru from 2012 to 2016. Participants were divided in two groups according to the presence or absence of high TG/HDL-C ratio, IR or hyperinsulinemia after OGTT. TG/HDL-C ratio values ≥ 3 were considered as high. IR was defined as a Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) value ≥ 2.28 and hyperinsulinemia after OGTT as a serum insulin value ≥ 80μU/mL after 120 min of 75-g glucose intake. We elaborated crude and adjusted Poisson generalized linear models to evaluate the association between high TG/HDL-C ratio and IR or hyperinsulinemia after OGTT and reported the prevalence ratio (PR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).
Results
We analyzed the data of 118 individuals. Prevalence of high TG/HDL-C ratio was 17.8% (n = 21) while the prevalence of IR and hyperinsulinemia after OGTT was 24.6% (n = 29) and 17.0% (n = 20), respectively. TG/HDL-C-ratio values were positively correlated with HOMA-IR (r = 0.498; p < 0.01) and serum insulin after OGTT (r = 0.326; p < 0.001). In the adjusted model, high TG/HDL-C ratio was associated with both IR (aPR = 3.16; 95%CI: 1.80–5.77) and hyperinsulinemia after OGTT (aPR = 2.36; 95%CI: 1.20–4.63).
Conclusions
High TG/HDL-C ratio was associated with both IR markers used in our study, appearing to be a clinically useful tool to assess IR in euthyroid normal-weight adults without type 2 diabetes mellitus."

Prediabetes is a condition in which blood glucose level is above the normal but below the diagnostic value of diabetes mellitus. Besides progression to diabetes mellitus, prediabetic subjects are at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is associated with oxidative stress and inflammation and therefore this research was conducted with the aim to evaluate the risk of cardiovascular disease in prediabetic subjects by measuring the markers of oxidative stress and inflammation and their possible correlation with glucose intolerance.
Materials and methods
A total of 400 human subjects were recruited for the present cross-sectional study. Of them, 200 were prediabetic subjects and 200 were age and gender-matched control subjects. Blood samples were collected from all participants and analyzed for 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxy-guanosine (8-OHdG), malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP).
Results
The markers of oxidative stress i.e. 8-OHdG and MDA were found to be significantly increased in prediabetic subjects as compared to control subjects except GSH, which was significantly reduced in prediabetic subjects. Similarly, hs-CRP (a marker of inflammation) was significantly increased in prediabetic subjects compared to controls. On correlation analysis, 8-OHdG, MDA and hs-CRP were significantly and positively correlated with glucose intolerance in prediabetes whereas GSH showed significant negative correlation with glucose intolerance.
Conclusion
In conclusion, markers of oxidative stress and inflammation should be taken into consideration while evaluating the risk for CVD in prediabetes since these markers were well correlated with glucose intolerance in prediabetic subjects."

Insulin resistance (IR) and abnormal lipid profiles are the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases in obesity. To clarify the relationship of the changes in insulin resistance, body weight and lipid profile, the present study was performed on Bangladeshi adults, total of 1500 individuals at the time of their general health examination in the hospital.
Methods
After exclusion of other endocrine diseases, the remaining 772 patients were classified as IR ≥ 2 and IR < 2 based on the homeostatic model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index. The endocrine disease free subjects were further clustered based on age, gender and obesity. The anthropometric and biochemical profiles were statistically analyzed and correlated with IR ≥ 2 and IR<2 groups as well as other clusters of the subjects. Apart from some disparities, notable differences were observed in all anthropometric data.
Results
Total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and serum insulin levels were significantly higher in IR ≥ 2 group in comparison with IR<2 group. Obesity and dyslipidemia were associated as prevalent components of IR. Generalized linear model revealed that TC: LDL and TG: HDL had significant effect on IR. Age group II (41–60 years old) subjects had significantly higher lipid profile compared to age group I (20–40 years old) and age group III (61–80 years old).
Conclusions
Results reported herein support the notion that lipoprotein ratios might be the reliable biomarkers to evaluate IR."

No studies have examined the contribution of major dietary patterns to MUH phenotypes in obese and overweight people based on Karelis criteria. This study was conducted to evaluate the association of major dietary patterns with MUHOW/O and MHOW/O phenotypes.
Methods
This cross-sectional study was conducted on 290 overweight and obese women aged 18–50 (BMI≥25 kg/m2). Anthropometric measurements were assessed in all participants. The MH phenotype was defined according to the Karelis criteria. Major dietary patterns were determined using factor analysis of 21 foods groups using a valid and reliable FFQ containing 147 items. Participants' body composition was assessed by BIA. Serum HDL, LDL, TG, insulin, and hs-CRP levels were quantified by ELISA.
Results
By the use of factor analysis, 3 major dietary patterns were extracted: healthy dietary pattern (HDP), western dietary pattern (WDP) and unhealthy dietary pattern (UNHDP). Binary logistic analysis showed that participants in the in the upper category of WDP had greater odds of MUH phenotype (OR = 2.33, 95%CI = 1.11–4.91, P = 0.02), after confounder factor control.

Results
There was no difference in age, weight, and BMI between the two groups. The incidence of macrosomia, shoulder dystocia and stillbirth were similar in the two groups while that of pre-term labour, pre-eclampsia, Caesarean section (CS), large for gestational age (LGA), neonatal ICU (NICU) admission and neonatal hypoglycaemia were significantly higher in the T1DM than in the control group. From a multivariate regression analysis, excessive gestational weight gain was associated with increased risk of LGA (OR 4.53; 95% CI [1.42–14.25]). Last trimester HBA1c was associated with increased risk for macrosomia [OR 2.46, 95% CI [1.03–5.86)]; LGA [ OR 3.25, 95% CI [1.65–6.40)]; increased risk for C-section (OR 1.96, 95% CI [1.12–3.45]), and increased risk of NICU admission (OR 2.46, 95% CI [1.04–5.86]).

Contemporary studies examine the connection of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) with Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), alone or associated with other factors of the metabolic syndrome. However, little research has occurred concerning patients with diabetes of both genders and sexes without other diseases of the lower urinary tract. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between DM and LUTS.
Methods
The study enrolled 110 patients with DM and 134 healthy individuals. The IPSS questionnaire was used for the evaluation of symptoms from lower urinary tract. Data was analyzed with univariate and multivariate logistic regression using SPSS v.24.
Results
Analysis with moderate/severe LUTS as dependent variable and plausible confounding factors (age group, BMI, hypertension, dyslipidemia, years with DM and reported HbA1c) as covariates revealed that only HbA1c levels correlated independently with the presence of moderate/severe LUTS (p = 0,024, OR:2,729, CI:1,144–6,509) in diabetic women, while there was no statistically significant difference between male groups. HbA1c levels' correlation with IPSS-voiding and IPSS- storage score was not statistically significant. Quality of life is also affected in women with diabetes mellitus (p: 0,02).
Conclusion

Hypoglycemia in critically ill infants is a frequent metabolic disorder which is often due to defective glucose homeostasis. If not recognized annotated early, it can result in severe neurological damage with high mortality and morbidity. Today, glucometer is recommended for fast measuring blood glucose. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of glucometer for early diagnosis of hypoglycemia in the acutely ill infant.
Materials and methods
This study evaluates 130 critically ill infants less than 1year of age who were admitted to Besat hospital – Sanandaj – IRAN. Blood sugar was measured by standard serum method (glucose oxidase) and glucometer reagent strip.
Results
The overall means of blood sugar were 115.6 ± 1.75 with serum method and 119.1 ± 1.56 with glucometer method. The rates of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value with glucometer method and with serum glucose method were 72%, 53%, 62%, and 77% respectively. The correlation between the two methods was significant (p < 0.001). Kappa statistics for the two methods was 42%.
Conclusions
The results showed that in general, glucometer may be appropriate for rapid screening in emergency situations and when frequent blood glucose monitoring is needed but it cannot be regarded as a very suitable and reliable tool for diagnosis of hypoglycemia in critically ill infants."

Prediabetes is a chronic low-grade inflammatory disease and considered as a risk factor for the development of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a leukocyte-derived enzyme, linked to both oxidative stress and inflammation and has been proposed as a possible mediator of atherosclerosis, the major cause of cardiovascular disease. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the level of MPO in prediabetic subjects and correlate it with other cardiovascular disease risk factors.
Materials and methods
In this cross-sectional study, a total of 400 subjects were recruited. Of them, 200 were prediabetic subjects and 200 were age and gender-matched controls. For each subject, blood pressure, weight, height, waist circumference, hip circumference and lipid parameters were measured. In addition, MPO was determined.
Results
MPO was significantly increased in prediabetic subjects as compared to controls. In correlation analysis, MPO was found to be significantly and positively correlated with all the cardiovascular disease risk factors i.e. age, body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), blood pressure [both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)], lipid parameters except high density lipoprotein (HDL) to which it was negatively correlated.
Conclusion
In conclusion, MPO is well correlated with cardiovascular disease risk factors in prediabetes. Hence, MPO could be used to detect cardiovascular risk among prediabetic subjects and also can be used as an early biomarker of oxidative stress and inflammation in prediabetes."

abstract = "Introduction
An inadequate glycemic control in cardiovascular postoperative is a predictor of mortality, postoperative infections and a prolonged hospital stay. This study evaluates the incidence of hypoglycemia in the first 72 h of postoperative and its association with different factors, such as tissue perfusion parameters, and the administration of medicines that induct hypoglycemia during surgery, in patients that undergo cardiovascular surgery in a 4th level hospital in Bogota, Colombia.
Methods and materials
A nested cases and controls study was developed, taking as cases the patients that presented hypoglycemia episodes (<70 mg/dl) and the controls were the patients without this outcome. A systematic record of the glycemic control in the first 72 h of postoperative was registered. An univariate and multivariate analysis was conducted to determine the factor associated with hypoglycemia.
Results
327 patients were evaluated (35% with coronary bypass and 27% with valvular replacement). 7.65% of the patients presented at least one episode of hypoglycemia <70 mg/dL (25 episodes). The multivariate analysis showed an association with chronic kidney failure in dialysis (OR6,21; IC:0,97–43.27,p:0.05), administration of preoperative steroids (OR4,41; IC:1,27-15,20,p:0.02), intraoperative insulin (OR2,61; IC:1.09–6,22, p:0.03), and postoperative hydrocortisone (OR 7,15; IC 1,46-34,9 p:0.01).
Conclusions
Hypoglycemia is frequent in patients that undergo a cardiovascular surgery. The associated factors were chronic kidney failure in dialysis, administration of preoperative steroids, intraoperative insulin and hydrocortisone during postoperative. Other factors such as tissue perfusion, administration of vasoactive or beta blockers substances, showed no association with hypoglycemia."

To evaluate the association between vitamin D deficiency and insulin resistance (IR) or hyperinsulinemia after oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in euthyroid non-diabetic individuals.
Materials and methods
We carried out an analytical cross-sectional study in euthyroid non-diabetic adults of both sexes, who attended the outpatient service of a private clinic in Lima-Peru during the 2012–2016 period. Participants were categorized in two groups according to their serum vitamin D levels: normal vitamin D levels (serum vitamin D values ≥ 20 ng/dL) and vitamin D deficiency (serum vitamin D values < 20 ng/dL). IR was defined as a Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) value ≥ 3.8 and hyperinsulinemia after OGTT was defined as a serum insulin value ≥ 80μU/mL after 120 min of 75-g glucose intake. We elaborated crude and adjusted Poisson regression models to assess the association between serum vitamin D levels and IR or hyperinsulinemia after OGTT. The reported association measure was the prevalence ratio (PR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).
Results
We analyzed 204 participants, the average age was 38.5 ± 10.6 (SD) years, 40 (19.6%) were males and the vitamin D median was 25.0 (IQR: 19.0–33.3) ng/dL. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, IR and hyperinsulinemia after OGTT was 29.4% (n = 60), 29.9% (n = 61) and 25.0% (n = 51). In the adjusted Poisson regression models, the prevalence of hyperinsulinemia after OGTT was higher among the vitamin D deficient group (aPR=1.75; 95%CI: 1.06–2.90); however, we did not find statistically significant association between vitamin D deficiency and IR (aPR=0.99; 95%CI: 0.61–1.63).
Conclusions
We found an association between vitamin D deficiency and hyperinsulinemia after OGTT in euthyroid people with no T2DM.Our findings are consistent with previous reports; providing evidence that serum vitamin D deficiency could be an IR marker."

Egyptian Christians account for about 10%–15% of the population; the largest absolute number in the Middle East and North Africa. The Lent period is one of the three principal fasting periods which is less documented in the scientific literature.
Objectives
To evaluate the effect of Lenten fasting on anthropometric measures, biochemical and glycemic parameters in Christian patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Methods
A prospective study, which was carried out in Assiut university hospital clinics of internal medicine during the period between February and May 2018 on 125 Christian patients with type 2 diabetes who fasted the Lent. The study was carried out in 3 phases.A semi-structured questionnaire was used to assess the risk category of fasting. Data were presented as mean ± standard deviation.
Results
Fasting blood glucose decreased significantly during, and after the fast.The number of patients with fasting blood glucose <8 mmol/L increased during fasting from 24.8% to 32.0%.Hypoglycemia during fasting occurred in 12.8% of patients. Hyperglycemia and dehydration were the main causes of breaking the fast.Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased during and after the fast. There was no significant change in high density lipoprotein cholesterol. Body weight of patients did not significantly change during fasting.
Conclusion
The Lenten fasting affected different biochemical parameters of fasting diabetic patients. The variations in the amount and type of diets of fasting patients caused variations in the results among patients of the study and between this study and the other studies."

Subjects and methods
In this case control study, Serum levels of CTRP3, HbA1c, Lipid profile, glucose and insulin levels were determined in 75 obese and 68 normal body weight individuals.
Results
In obese young adults CTRP3 concentrations were decreased compared to normal body weight young adults (NBW). The association between reduction of CTRP3 concentrations and the presence of diabetes is statistically significant. CTRP3 showed significant negative correlation with BMI, HOMA-IR and triglycerides as well as positive correlations with HDL – cholesterol while there is no association between CTRP3 and BMI within the NBW group. Higher HbA1C, HOMA-IR, and risk of diabetes development within obese subjects were related to lower CTRP3 concentration.
Conclusions
This study shows that reduction of CTRP3 concentrations is likely to bring a concomitant increase in risk of diabetes in obese and normal body weight young adults. Decrease in CTRP3 concentration may have an essential role in the pathophysiology of metabolic disorders concomitant to obesity."

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a global epidemic. However, T2DM is not a new, 21stcentury disease. Different populations have been struggling with this disease across a number of centuries. The question lies as to why humanity has never succeeded in keeping it in check over the course of its history.
Materials and methods
In this review, the history of T2DM and its evolution throughout the ages are revisited. The review then investigates the growing burden of T2DM across the past fourteen years within the European continent, while comparing this epidemic with the obesity burden.
Results
Various explanations for the emergence of this public health epidemic were explored ranging from lifestyle factors, high sugary food and drink, disrupted sleep pattern to obesity. Over a fourteen-year period, an evident steady incline in both T2DM and obesity prevalence rates across Europe was evident.
Conclusion
It is essential for public health officials and researchers alike to have a good grip of the past and the present diabetes epidemiology and its co-determinants. This will provide the basis for new and improved strategies to target and prevent this epidemic."

Insulin resistance (IR) is predominant in type 2 diabetic patients. This study aimed to investigate benefits from adding l-carnitine to ongoing glimepiride compared to glimepiride monotherapy on IR in diabetic patients who failed to achieve their glycemic goals on glimepiride monotherapy.
Methods
58 patients were recruited from Internal Medicine Department, Tanta University Hospital, Egypt then prospectively randomized to receive their glimepiride dose 2 mg twice daily (group 1) or glimepiride 2 mg twice daily + l-carnitine 1 g m twice daily (group 2) for 6 months. Fasting blood samples were collected at baseline, 3 and 6 months after treatment for analysis of fasting and postprandial blood glucose [FBG &PPBG], glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c %], fasting insulin, extracellular part of insulin regulated aminopeptidase [IRAPe] as a novel marker, tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-α], visfatin and lipid panel. Body mass index [BMI] and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR] were calculated. Data were statistically analyzed by SPSS using unpaired Student's t-test and one way analysis of variance; p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
The obtained data suggested that adding l-carnitine to glimepiride has a significantly beneficial effect on FBG, PPBG, HbA1c, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR index, IRAPe, TNF-α, visfatin and lipid panel parameters but doesn't have effect on BMI and blood pressure.
Conclusion
The co-administration of l-carnitine with glimepiride represents a new therapeutic strategy for better controlling diabetic patients as it resulted in more beneficial effects on direct and indirect biomarkers of insulin resistance than glimepiride alone."

The results indicated that women in low RMR group had higher fat mass (P < 0.0001), FFM (P = 0.002), weight (P = 0.006), BMI (P < 0.0001), age (P = 0.01), and hs-CRP (P = 0.001). The results did not confirm any significant mediating roles for RBP4 (P = 0.051, β = −0.28) and Vaspin (P = 0.06, β = 0.32) in the RMR-MetS relationship. Additionally, after a binary regression test, Omentin-1 showed a significant mediating role (P = 0.25, β = 0.04) as an interrelated agent to RMR and MetS.
Conclusion
As this study shows, Omentin-1 was found to play a significant mediating role as a mediatory agent in relationship between RMR and MetS."

Diabetic nephropathy is known to be an independent risk factor in the progression of renal and cardiovascular disorders. Due to the association between vitamin D deficiency and diabetic nephropathy, vitamin D deficiency in the diabetic nephropathy population, this study conducted to examine the effects of Vitamin D3 on metabolic and inflammatory parameters in patients with diabetic nephropathy.
Methods
This eight-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was carried out on 50 diabetic nephropathy patients with marginal status of vitamin D. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups: control and intervention. Participants received a vitamin D3 (50000 IU) supplement weekly on a specific day. Fasting blood samples were collected from all patients at their entry to the study, and eight weeks after intervention.
Results
Analyses showed significance differences in physical activity between the intervention and placebo groups (P = 0.018). There were no significant differences between the percentage changes of HbA1c, insulin and, inflammatory parameters such as TNF-α and IL-6 (P > 0.05), while the percentage change of FBS was significantly higher in the placebo group compared to the treatment one (P < 0.0001). Lower levels of FBS (P < 0.0001), insulin (P < 0.069), HOMA-IR (P < 0.001), TNF-α (P< 0.002) and IL-6 (P < 0.037) were found after supplementation in treatment group. However, the phosphorous and protein percentage change in urine were lower (P = 0.07) and higher (P = 0.003) between groups.
Conclusions
It was found that vitamin D supplementation can be regarded as an effective way to prevent the progression of diabetic nephropathy by reducing levels of proteinuria, and inflammatory markers such as TNF-α and IL-6."

Approximately 2.8 million deaths are reported as a result of being overweight or obese. Due to the consumption of energy dense food (i.e. unhealthy food habits), sedentary life style, lack of health care services and financial support, the developing countries are facing high risk of obesity and their adverse consequences (i.e. diabetes, ischemic heart disease, etc). In India, more than 135 million individuals were affected by obesity. The prevalence of obesity in India varies due to age, gender, geographical environment, socio-economic status, etc. According to ICMR-INDIAB study 2015, prevalence rate of obesity and central obesity are varies from 11.8% to 31.3% and 16.9%–36.3% respectively. In India, abdominal obesity is one of the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVDs). Various studies have shown that the prevalence of obesity among women were significantly higher as compared to men. Obesity is one of the main medical and financial burdens for the government. This problem of obesity can be preventable by spreading public awareness about obesity and its health consequences. Governmental agencies should promote the benefits of healthy life style, food habits and physical activity. The aim of this article is to report the prevalence of obesity in different regions of India and highlight the problem areas."

The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the Diabetes Comprehensive Care Model (DCCM) intervention on diabetes care outcomes. We hypothesized that participants receiving diabetes care from the mobile diabetes clinic (intervention group) would demonstrate significant improvement in glycemic control compared to those receiving treatment as usual (control group).
Materials and methods
We conducted a longitudinal, quasi-experimental study in which two similar clinics were identified. From both, we recruited 100 patients diagnosed with Type II diabetes. At baseline, patients were similar in terms of both socio-demographic and diabetes health variables. The team visited patients at the Bethlehem clinic at the beginning and end of the study (control group). Mobile diabetes care teams implemented the DCCM in Hebron four times over one year (treatment group).
Results
Most participants were female (63.5%) with average diabetes duration of 7.9 years. Initial HbA1c was 9.49% on average (SD = 1.93) and 9.20% (SD = 1.92) for the control and intervention groups, respectively. Statistically significant change in HbA1c, cholesterol, creatinine and systolic BP were observed in the intervention group (differences in change between recruitment and follow-up). That is, significant improvement over time was observed for the treatment group whereas little or no change was observed for the control group.
Conclusion
The DCCM-based intervention leads to improved glycemic control parameters indicative of diabetes control. Clinically significant change was observed in treatment group only. Integrative diabetes care appears especially well suited for fragmented healthcare systems with limited resources."

Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of mortality and morbidity in diabetic patients. Insulin resistance has been shown to be reduced by the secretion of irisin from muscle and adipose tissues. This study was aimed at determining the relationship between serum irisin levels and angiographically defined coronary artery disease (CAD) in type II diabetic patients.
Methods
In this case-control study, 30 diabetic subjects with angiographically defined CAD were compared with 30 age- and sex-matched diabetic subjects without CAD in terms of clinical and laboratory parameters including serum irisin levels.
Results
Serum levels of Irisin were significantly higher in the diabetic group without CAD compared with the group with CAD (P = 0.048). Serum irisin levels showed a significant positive correlation with BMI (r = 0.374, P = 0.004) and fasting insulin (r = 0.303, P = 0.021), and a significant negative correlation with diabetes duration (r = −0.384, P = 0.002). Based on the results of the binary logistic regression model, circulating levels of irisin were associated with the presence of CAD in diabetes (p = 0.038) after adjusting for potential confounders.
Conclusion
Serum irisin levels were lower in the diabetic patients with cardiovascular complication compared with the uncomplicated diabetic patients. Therefore, additional larger scale studies are needed to determine the role of irisin in monitoring CAD in diabetic patients."

We compared the ability of the selected anthropometric indicators to best predict the prevalence of hypertension among the Indian tribes.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was undertaken among 1431 adult participants (705 males and 726 females) between the ages of 20 and 60 years from six major tribes in India. Selected anthropometric indicators such as body mass index (BMI), waist-hip-ratio (WHR), waist-height-ratio (WHtR), percentage body fat (PBF), visceral fat (VF), minimum-waist-circumference (MWC) and sum-of-the-four skinfold thickness (SF4), along with the physiological parameters such as blood pressure were recorded. Discriminant analysis (DA) was performed to examine and compare the ability of the selected anthropometric indicators towards classifying hypertension among males, females and the total population.
Results
Significant independent association was observed for hypertension and similar conditions within gender and selected age-group categories. The overall hypertension prevalence among the studied tribes was observed at 12.6%. Standardized function coefficients (SFCs) in discriminant analysis revealed PBF(0.89, 0.36, and 0.76 for overall, males, and females respectively) as the most powerful discriminator of hypertension. In addition, visceral fat (0.74, 1.46, and 0.58 for overall, males and females respectively) was observed to be the other significant indicator of hypertensive blood pressure. These exploratory findings for the first time indicate fat deposition, rather than body density alone, as an emerging physiological and metabolic risk among Indian tribes.
Conclusion
In the context of the highly prevalent chronic undernutrition, internal fat deposition is a major classifying factor of physiological and metabolic intolerance. It also indicates the increasing trend in lifestyle changes and the associated adversities among the Indian tribes."

To assess the association between elevated triglycerides/glucose index (TGI) and insulin resistance (IR) or hyperinsulinemia after oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in a sample of healthy adults.
Methods
We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study in euthyroid non-diabetic adults, who attended the outpatient service of a private clinic in Lima-Peru during the 2012–2016 period. Participants were categorized in two groups according to the presence or absence of elevated TGI, IR or hyperinsulinemia after OGTT. A TGI value ≥ 8.65 was considered as elevated. We defined IR as a Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) value ≥ 2.28 and hyperinsulinemia after OGTT as a serum insulin value ≥ 80μU/mL after 120 min of 75-g glucose intake. We elaborated crude and adjusted Poisson regression models to assess the association between elevated TGI and IR or hyperinsulinemia after OGTT. The reported association measure was the prevalence ratio (PR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).
Results
We analyzed 118 individuals, the average age was 37.5 ± 11.3 years, 21 (17.8%) were males and the median BMI was 22.7 ± 1.6 kg/m2. The prevalence of elevated TGI was 25.4% (n=30) while the prevalence of IR and hyperinsulinemia after OGTT was 24.6% (n=29) and 17.0% (n=20) respectively. In the adjusted model, elevated TGI was associated with both IR (aPR=6.36; 95%CI: 3.41–11.86) and hyperinsulinemia after OGTT (aPR=4.19; 95%CI: 1.81–9.70).
Conclusions
We found that elevated TGI was associated with both IR markers in a sample of euthyroid adults without T2DM and with a normal BMI. The simplicity of the TGI calculation makes it the first-choice alternative when the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp or HOMA-IR are not available."

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) ranks as the fifth most obese country with increasing cardio-metabolic risks. In this paper, relationships of salivary adipocytokines (markers of cardio-metabolic syndrome), diet quality and physical activity in 90 normal-weight, overweight and obese (30 subjects in each group) Emirati adult females were investigated.
Methods
A cross-sectional research design was adopted. Anthropometric measurements, diet quality and physical activity questionnaires were administered. Overnight fasting saliva was collected to determine levels of adiponectin, interleukin-10 (IL-10) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α).
Results
Salivary adiponectin was significantly lower, while TNF-α was higher in obese than normal-weight subjects. IL-10 displayed a lower trend in obese subjects. Though diet quality and physical activity did not exhibit significant differences among the three groups, better diet quality and higher physical activity level were reported among normal-weight subjects. Salivary TNF-α correlated positively with body mass index (BMI) (r = 0.37; p < 0.001) and waist circumference (r = 0.31; p < 0.001), while adiponectin correlated negatively with BMI (r = −0.28; p < 0.05). IL-10 showed negative trend in correlation with obesity measures. Correlations were not observed between diet quality and physical activity with salivary adipocytokines. Interestingly, a significant negative correlation emerged between diet quality and neck circumference (r = −0.24; p < 0.05).
Conclusion
Our findings demonstrate that salivary adipocytokines correlate with obesity measures and can serve as convenient adjunct method in predicting cardio-metabolic risks in the population."

The World Health Organization recommends the implementation of interventions focused on the early detection of clinical risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) as effective strategies for the control of CVD in low resource settings. However, due to health system resource constraints, surveillance capacity for the identification of high-risk populations for non-communicable diseases, including CVD have been inadequate. The purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence of CVD clinical risk factors among healthy adults residing in the Cape Coast metropolis of Ghana. The clinical risk factors assessed included glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, lipid control and blood pressure.
Methods
The study participants included 70 healthy adults without a previous diagnosis of CVD from Cape Coast metropolis. Blood samples, blood pressure and anthropometric measurement were obtained for each participant. Serum glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin, glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol levels were measured.
Results
Approximately four out of ten participants were either overweight or obese. Almost three-quarters of the sample were considered prehypertensive or hypertensive. About three in ten were clinically prediabetic. About a third of the participants had high non-HDL cholesterol levels. Triglyceride concentration levels were found to be high in almost 10 percent of the study sample. Approximately six percent were identified as having metabolic syndrome.
Conclusion
A significant proportion of the study participants were identified to be at risk for CVD. There is the need for adaptive and less resource-intensive CVD risk-factor screening interventions to allow for the timely detection and management of CVD risk factors in low-resource settings."

abstract = "Aims
The aim of this study is to identify lifestyle factors that place people with type 2 diabetes in Saudi Arabia at a greater risk of macro- and microvascular complications.
Methods
A survey was conducted among adults with type 2 diabetes who attended diabetes centres in three major cities in Saudi Arabia. Participants were interviewed and their medical files were reviewed for lab test results and documented comorbidities. Associations between complication and lifestyle factors were assessed using multiple logistic regression analysis.
Results
A total of 1121 participants were recruited. Mean age was 57.6 (±11.1) years. The prevalence of coronary artery disease, diabetic foot, and stroke was 17.0%, 13.1% and 3.7%, and that of neuropathy, renal impairment, and retinopathy was 20.3%, 14.5%, and 42.8% respectively. Lifestyle factors associated with one or more of the complications were inadequate physical activity, longer sitting time, obesity, current or past smoking, passive smoking, hypertension, poor glycaemic control, low HDL and high triglycerides.
Conclusions
Diabetes complications are common among people with type 2 diabetes in Saudi Arabia. Life style factors such as inadequate physical activity, longer sitting time, obesity, smoking, hypertension, and poor control of blood glucose and lipids should be assimilated into complications prevention program."

To identify certain risk factors associated with childhood obesity related to lifestyle; dietary patterns, physical activity, and sedentary behavior.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted among 977 schoolchildren (473 boys and 449 girls) aged 7–18 years. Children were selected randomly from three main cities in Jordan: Amman, Irbid, and Mafraq by using multistage cluster sampling method. Sedentary behaviors, physical activity and child eating behaviors were measured by using validated questionnaires. Overweight and obesity were defined by International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) criteria.
Results
Sedentary activities increase the risk of overweight among schoolchildren by 2-fold [RR(Relative risk) = 2.0, 95% CI(Confidence interval) (1.1–3.6), p = 0.02]. Whereas, sedentary activities for less than 3 h increased the risk of overweight by 0.8-fold [RR = 0.8, 95%CI (0.6–1.3), P = 0.388], Schoolchildren who spent<30 min/day in exercising decreased the risk of overweight by 0.5-fold [RR = 0.5, 95% CI (0.2–1.0), P = 0.06)]. Both Students who ate one meal daily and daily ate snacks from schools cafeterias had a higher tendency to be obese [(RR = 1.8, 95%CI (0.5–5.9), P = 0.368], and [RR = 1.5, 95%CI (0.9–2.5), P = 0.169] respectively.
Conclusions
Physical activity, eating meals regularly and homemade food, all together play a significant role in decreasing obesity among Jordanian schoolchildren, thus a national policy that promoting active living and healthy eating among schoolchildren is warranted."

Methods
PREDATORR was an epidemiological study with a cross-sectional, cluster random sampling design. Participants were classified into four dyslipidemia phenotypes based on the NCEP ATP III criteria: isolated hypertrigliceridemia, isolated hypoHDL-C, isolated hyperLDL-C and mixed dyslipidemia (≥2 standard lipid abnormalities). Overall, 2656 were included in the analysis by dyslipidemia phenotypes.
Results
An estimated 67.1% of Romanian adults have at least one lipid abnormality: 27.5% (95%CI26.0–28.9%) have elevated TG, 29.4% (95%CI27.9–30.8%) have low HDL-C and 47.8% (95%CI46.3–49.2%) have elevated LDL-C (26.2% had LDL-C levels ≥2.58 mmol/l associated with CHD or CHD risk equivalent). Also, 30% Romanian adults have mixed dyslipidemia with 7.6% (95%CI6.1–9.0%) having all three lipid abnormalities.
The age
and sex-adjusted prevalence of isolated dyslipidemia phenotypes in Romanian adult population was 23.7% (95%CI22.2–25.1%) for hyperLDL-Cholesterolemia, 9.3% (95%CI7.8–10.7%) for hypoHDL-Cholesterolemia and 4.1% (95%CI2.6–5.5%) for hypertriglyceridemia. Among participants with triglycerides ≥2.25 mmol/l, 15.2% (95%CI13.7–16.6%) of Romanian adults have non-HDL-C levels ≥3.36 mmol/l.
Conclusions
The PREDATORR survey indicated a high prevalence of dyslipidemia phenotypes in the Romanian population aged 20–79 years, providing data on its association with several cardiometabolic risk factors."

The metabolic syndrome (MetS) becomes increasingly obvious from an early age. The current study aimed at exploring the relationship between insulin resistance and the main biomarkers of MetS in young adult algerian patients.
Methods
Glucose, HbA1C, total cholesterol (TC), hjgh bensity lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), insulinemia and C-peptide, adipokins (leptin, adiponectin), inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-a), us-CRP and GLP-1 were measured by suitable methods. Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) was used to detect the degree of insulin resistance.
Results
The MetS patients displayed higher glucose, insulin, HbA1c values and impaired lipid profile as judged by increasing TC, TG, LDL-C levels and lower HDL-C. Furthermore, adipokines, HDL-C and CRP contents were significantly higher whilst TG and LDL-C were much lower in MetS female group as compared to male patients suggesting most pronounced metabolic perturbation in the latter group. The probability of a significant correlation between HOMA and studied variables was often higher in female than male subjects. Such was the case for total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, adiponectin, interleukin-6, TNF-α and hs-CRP.
Conclusion
The high rate of metabolic syndrome among young obese adults is alarming, this requiring extensive investigations in prone subjects."

This study aimed to (1) assess the level of diabetes self-care knowledge among patients with diabetes mellitus and (2) examine the relationship between patients' diabetes self-care knowledge and their demographic and medical characteristics.
Methods
A cross-sectional design was used to implement the study. A convenience sample of 273 diabetic patients were recruited from five primary health-care centers in Amman- Jordan.
Results
The overall level of knowledge of diabetes self-care in the total sample was moderate (58.28% (SD = 18.24)). The highest level of knowledge was meal planning (70.2%) followed by monitoring, causes of diabetes, foot care, symptoms and complication, diabetic medication, and the lowest level was exercise (42.5%). Furthermore, knowledge of diabetes self-care was found to be associated with age, educational status, diabetic medications and years with diabetes.
Conclusion
and Practice implications: The study findings emphasized that diabetic patients had a moderate level of knowledge and there were many of the learning needs for each area of knowledge. The health-care professional has an important role in developing the appropriate diabetes educational programs based on patients' learning needs and patients' characteristics. These programs that enhances knowledge on diabetes could be reduced or prevented diabetes-related complications."

Cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness (CRF, MF) are independent predictor of metabolic syndrome (MS). The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between CRF, MF and MS in male adults.
Methods
Data collected from 10,774 males who visited the National Fitness Center between 2002 and 2009. The data included measurements of subjects' blood pressure, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, body mass index, CRF (VO2max), MF (grip strength, push-up, sit-up, knee joint strength). CRF, MF level was classified into three tertiles.
Results
As for the prevalence rate according to CRF level, the differences between groups were 47.6% of the low CRF group, 33.1% of the middle CRF group, and 19.3% of the high CRF group were found to have MS. As for the MS prevalence rate according to MF level, the differences between groups were 47.1% of the low, 31.8% of the middle, 21.1% of the high MF group were found to MS. It was found that MS odds ratios (OR, 95% confidence interval) decreased as the CRF levels improved; as indicated by OR = 0.64 (0.57–0.72) in the middle CRF, OR = 0.36 (0.31–0.41) in the high CRF. As for MF, the middle MF, OR = 0.62 (0.55–0.70), the high MF, OR = 0.40 (0.35–0.45) were lower than that of the low MF.
Conclusion
The level of CRF, MF has association with MS in men. This study suggests that we need to manage our fitness to prevent MS."

We evaluate retrospectively long-term effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists in type 2 diabetic patients treated between 2008 and 2016.
Methods
131 patients treated by GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) were included. The objective was to evaluate the evolution of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) during a period up to 4 years. The secondary objectives consisted of analysing the long-term effects of treatment on body mass index (BMI), blood pressure and lipids; reporting the proportion of patients who reached HbA1c objectives; estimating the time before treatment failure and determining predictive factors of failure. We also compared twice-daily exenatide to once-daily liraglutide on the major parameters.
Results
HbA1c improved significantly, mostly during the first year of treatment (−1.2%), and this effect was maintained after 4 years (−1.4% vs. baseline). At 1 year, 26% and 47% of subjects achieved HbA1c levels <7.0% and 7.5%, respectively. Treatment failure was observed in 51% of patients after a mean duration of GLP-1RA treatment of 50 months. Half of patients had failed after 42 months. Baseline HbA1c greater than 9.0% and male gender were predictive factors of treatment failure. BMI also decreased: −0.9 kg/m2 the first year, −1.9 kg/m2 after 4 years. No significant difference was found between patients treated with exenatide and liragutide over time.
Conclusions
The beneficial effects of GLP-1RAs on HbA1c reached a plateau after the first year of treatment and are maintained at 4 years only in one third of patients. Failure occurred predominantly in men with a baseline HbA1c greater than 9%."

Up to 27% of the direct medical cost of diabetes may be attributed to DPN [3]. A 2013 article from the American Diabetes Association reported a $176 billion direct medical cost of diabetes in 2012 [4]. DPN patients often suffer from shooting and burning pain in their distal limbs and a severe loss of sensation. Diabetic foot ulcers, infections, and amputations may follow. Currently available treatments: tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants such as gabapentin and pregabalin, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, duloxetine, topical 5% lidocaine (applied to the most painful area) can manage painful symptoms but do not address the underlying pathologies of DPN and diabetic wound ulcers. A combination of pain-reducing medications can provide relief when individual medications fail, and opioids such as tramadol and oxycodone may be administered with these medications to reduce pain [5]. Due to the prevalence of diabetes, DPN, and diabetic foot ulcers, and because of the lack of available effective treatments to directly address the pathology contributing to these conditions, novel treatments are being sought. Our hypothesis is that a deficiency of nitric oxide synthase in diabetic patients leads to a lack of vascularization of the peripheral nerves, which causes DPN; and this could be treated with vasodilators such as nitric oxide. In this paper, the mechanisms of DPN are reviewed and analyzed to elucidate the potential of a transdermal nitric oxide application for the treatment of DPN and diabetic wound ulcers by increasing vasodilation."

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disorder that interferes with the function of the beta cells in the pancreas. Reports show that the incidence of T1DM is increasing throughout England and Wales, along with the Body Mass Index (BMI) of this patient group. The association between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity is recognised, but literature describing the association between T1DM and high BMI is more limited. The aim of this paper is to identify factors affecting BMI and the impact that this increasing trend has on children and young people with T1DM.
Methods
Information was obtained from the medical records of patients with T1DM at the local paediatric centre. BMI standard deviation scores (SDS) were calculated and compared to other factors, which include insulin requirement, HbA1c, pubertal status and age at diagnosis.
Results
This study involved 102 patients (43 male and 59 female). The mean age at diagnosis was 7.79 years (range from 0.16 to 16.91 years). Our results showed a significant association between insulin requirement and BMI SDS (r = 0.23, p = 0.02) and a significant association between insulin requirement and mean HbA1c (r = 0.59, p=<0.01). A multivariable regression analysis of factors affecting BMI SDS showed that insulin requirement was an independent factor affecting BMI SDS.
Conclusion
There were significant associations between increased insulin requirement, high BMI SDS and poorer glycaemic control. Further research is required to fully understand the risk factors that may contribute to obesity in T1DM."

Recently, it was suggested that betatrophin has a role in controlling pancreatic β cell proliferation and lipid metabolism, however, its role in human subjects has not been established yet. The predicting role of betatrophin and MDA along with other biochemical indicators in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a sample of the Iraqi population was examined in the present investigation.
Methods
A total of 31 patients diagnosed with T2DM and 30 adult subjects without diabetes were matched in age and gender in a case-control study. Logistic and linear regression models were performed to examine the role of MDA and betatrophin in T2DM and triglyceride, respectively.
Results
The study confirmed a higher concentration of LDL (124.45 vs. 102.70 mg/dL; P = .001) and TG (191.13 vs. 103.83 mg/dL; P < .0001), insulin (18.40 vs. 10.97 μU/mL; P < .0001), and Hs. CRP (5.39 vs. 2.80 mg/L; P = .033) in diabetic patients compared to the controls. No significant difference in betatrophin and MDA was found between diabetic patients and non-diabetic healthy subjects. The study showed triglyceride as the only predictor of T2DM (P = .028). Similarly, total cholesterol (P < .0001), HDL (P = .001), LDL (P < .0003), and MDA (P = .010) were shown as predictors of triglyceride in diabetic patients.
Conclusion
The present study that triglyceride is a direct and MDA is an indirect predictor for T2DM."

Hyperuricemia is one of the metabolic parameter which has been considered to play an important role in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, there is still lack of studies about association between serum uric acid with liver disease progression in NAFLD. This study aimed to know the association between hyperuricemia with moderate to severe steatosis and significant fibrosis along with other metabolic factors in NAFLD patients evaluated using Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP) – Transient Elastography (TE).
Methods
This is a prospective study in NAFLD patients who came to our tertiary referral center University hospital hepatobiliary outpatient's clinic. All patients underwent metabolic parameters measurement including serum uric acid level and CAP-TE examination. Cutoff value used for significant liver fibrosis ≥7 kPa and ≥285 dB/m for moderate-severe steatosis.
Results
Of 113 NAFLD patients, there were 45 patients with moderate-severe steatosis and 34 patients with significant fibrosis. Multivariate analysis showed only high level of fasting blood glucose (OR 2756; 95% CI 1.131–6.717) and low HDL level (OR 4.196, 95% CI 1.22–14.430) to be independent risk factors of moderate-severe steatosis. High level of fasting blood glucose (OR 3.98, 95% CI 1.105–14.389) and hyperuricemia (OR 2.501, 95% CI 1.095–5.714) were found to be independent risk factors for significant liver fibrosis.

Exponential growth of metabolic syndrome in psychiatric disorders is becoming alarming situation to handle with. It is associated with reduced life span of 10–30 years in psychiatric patients attributed to metabolic syndrome, thus needs to be screened and addressed in all psychiatric patients.
Objective
the objective of this study was to know the prevalence and its risk factors in various psychiatric disorder and comparing them in older vs younger patients.
Methodology
A cross sectional indoor based study was conducted after taking ethical committee approval in 140 patients (substance use disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar and depressive disorders). All the metabolic parameters as per International diabetes federation criteria for metabolic syndrome were assessed involving waist circumference, weight, height, Systolic/diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, high density lipoprotein and triglycerides.
Statistics
Chi square and t-test were used.
Results
It was seen that prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS); 21.4% in psychiatric illness, up to 40% in major depressive disorders, followed by 33% in substance use disorder and 26.7% in psychotic disorders. Prevalence of MS was higher in older patients >30 years group (26% Vs. 16.4% in <30 years group). It was observed that substance use and depressive disorder and high BP in older male patients are all the significant risk factors for metabolic syndrome.
Conclusion
More than 1/5th psychiatric patients are affected by metabolic syndrome. Thus, all male psychiatric patients with high BP must be evaluated for metabolic syndrome."

Thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) is one of the mediators of oxidative stress induced beta-cell glucotoxisity. TXNIP might play a key role in impaired glucose homeostasis preceding overt T2DM. The aim of the present study was to compare TXNIP levels between patients with prediabetes and obese normoglycemic controls and to evaluate the link between TXNIP and metabolic risk factors.
Patients and methods
In the present study we included 79 patients with mean age 50.3 ± 10.6 years, divided into two age and BMI matched groups –control group with obesity without glycemic disturbances (NGT) (n = 40) and prediabetes (n = 39).
Results
We found significantly higher levels of TXNIP in patients with prediabetes compared to normoglycemic obese controls (54.2 ± 69.9 vs. 23.9 ± 47.1 pg/ml; p = 0.03). The levels of TXNIP gradually increased from normal glucose tolerance trough IFG/IGT only to IFG + IGT (27,1; 44.0; 49.9 and 95.7 pg/ml respectively; p = 0.025 between NGT and IFG + IGT). TXNIP levels correlated weakly only with fasting blood glucose (r = 0.235; p = 0.04) but not with glucose during OGTT or the markers of insulin resistance.
Conclusions
The levels of TXNIP are higher in patients with prediabetes compared to normoglycemic controls as they increase gradually from NGT trough IFG/IGT only to IFG + IGT."

Method
This study is a cross-sectional study conducted on 410 healthcare workers in a teaching hospital in Iran. Demographic, occupational, and psychosocial characteristics were assessed using questionnaire. Assessment of metabolic syndrome of hospital staff was performed at workplace during their medical examination.
Results
The frequency of metabolic syndrome was found to be 22.4%. This relationship was found among blood pressure and occupational stress, despite the fact that there was no significant relationship between metabolic syndrome and occupational stress. Higher age, having shift work, and inactivity were associated with metabolic syndrome.
Conclusion
Considering the high frequency of metabolic syndrome among Iranian healthcare workers, it is advised that effective management should be employed to correct the occupational and psychosocial factors associated with this syndrome."

There are studies which have compared the levels of different immunological mediators in GDM affected females and their healthy controls, but their findings are little controversial. Some of the studies have reported increased levels of IL-6, TNF-α, adiponectin, leptin, in females affected with GDM, while others do not confirm this. We have tried to summarize, in this short review, the findings of research studies being conducted globally, which have reported the association of insulin resistance, GDM and immunological markers.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common causes for chronic liver disease in Asians. It occurs more commonly in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, data on prevalence and associations of NAFLD among Sri Lankans with diabetes are lacking. The main aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with NAFLD in a cohort of diabetic patients.
Methods
Total of 233 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, followed up at a diabetes center in Southern Sri Lanka, were recruited by convenience sampling method. Each of them underwent a detailed medical history, physical examination, laboratory investigations and abdominal ultrasonography(USS). The diagnosis of NAFLD was made according to the established criteria using USS.
Results
The overall prevalence of NAFLD based on USS was 62.6% with no significant gender difference. Compared to USS, elevation in AST and ALT levels, based on NHANES III criteria, occurred only in 42% (98/234). The patients with NAFLD (56.7 ± 8.9) were significantly younger and had higher BMI and waist circumference, and raised AST and ALT than those without NAFLD. Binary logistic regression showed that the use of pioglitazone, higher BMI, and waist circumference were independently and significantly associated with NAFLD.
Conclusions
NAFLD is common in Sri Lankan patients with T2DM and central and global obesity are significant associations. Use of pioglitazone seemed to be protective against the development of NAFLD. These findings underscore the need for weight management as a preventive measure of NAFLD in T2DM patients."

abstract = "Aims
Although diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) commonly presents as a pure diabetic ketoacidosis (PDKA), up to 30% of cases may be associated with a mixed hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis (HMA). It is unknown whether there is a difference in treatment outcomes between these two entities. We evaluated an insulin infusion protocol (IIP), previously validated for hyperglycemia management in ICU's, for the management of PDKA and HMA.
Materials and methods
A retrospective case series/cohort study of 41 DKA admissions was further characterized as having PDKA or HMA. HMA was defined in those having an elevated delta-delta gradient (ΔAG-ΔHCO3) ≥ 5 mmol/L and base excess chloride (BECl) > 2.7 mmol/L. The main outcome measures were times to recovery of glucose levels to ≤250 mg/dL and of anion gap to ≤12 mmol/L.
Results
The initial serum glucose was 553 ± 265 mg/dL, serum bicarbonate of 8.8 ± 5.1 mmol/L, and venous pH 7.13 ± 0.2). Recovery of glucose occurred in 5 h: 25 min (±3 h:39min), and for anion gap in 11 h:25 min (±6 h:56min). HMA compared with PDKA had a delayed recovery of serum glucose (7 h: 23min ± 3 h: 35min vs. 4 h: 31min ± 3:h:21min, p = 0.017), which was due to the higher initial level of glucose (p = 0.02) rather than level of BECl (p = 0.17). There was no difference in time to anion gap closure between the PDKA and HMA.
Conclusions
Correction of hyperglycemia and acidosis in PDKA as well as in HMA was managed through the IIP. The simultaneous fluid and electrolyte management corrected the hypochloremic alkalosis."

Plasma concentrations of Acylation stimulating protein (ASP) and adiponectin are associated with body weight and energy homeostasis. The purpose of this study is to describe the potential role of acylation stimulating protein and adiponectin with metabolic risk marker in North Indian obese women.
Methods
This is a case control study. Total 520 women were recruited for the study n = 260 women with obesity (BMI>30) study group and n = 260 women without obesity (BMI<25) control group. Serum ASP and adiponectin level were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.
Results
Result indicated that WC, BP, lipid profile, FPG, FPI, IR (HOMA-IR), ASP were significantly higher but adiponectin and HDL were significantly lower in women with obesity than in women without obesity. Furthermore ASP was significantly positive correlated with WC, FPG, TG, VLDL, FPI and IR, whereas the correlation of adiponectin was significantly negative correlated with WC, FPG, TG, IR, ASP and significantly positive correlated with HDL in women with obesity.
Conclusion
The study shows that high level of ASP and low level of Adiponectin could be a potential marker of women with obesity among metabolic syndrome."

Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) means the amount of energy utilized by body in physical and psychological resting rate, after a night sleep, awake without any previous physical activity post meal (10 h after last meal) & neutral environment. In people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) there is an increase in BMR which is said to be associated with the level of glycaemic control. So, the objective of the study was to find out the correlation between BMR, Insulin resistance and Visceral fat in T2DM with peripheral neuropathy.
Materials & methods
A total of 50 participants with T2DM with peripheral neuropathy were included. Age group of 30–75 years were selected for the study. Participants with a known history of neurological disease, locomotor disability, and pregnancy were excluded from the study. Demographic details of the participants like duration of diabetes mellitus, age, Fasting Blood Glucose, Fasting Insulin, HOMA-IR, Glycated Haemoglobin (HBA1c), Neuropathy and Blood pressure values were noted. We measured Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) by using Mifflin-St Jeor predictive equation in T2DM with peripheral neuropathy.
Results
The mean age of the participants is 60.16 ± 10.62. The mean duration of T2DM 13.44 ± 11.92. In the present study we found a statistical significant correlation between BMR and HOMA IR (r = 0.913*; p = 0.000), BMR & Fasting blood sugar (FBS) (r = 0.281*; p = 0.048), BMR and Visceral fat (VF) (r = 0.332*; p = 0.018).
Conclusion
Basal metabolic rate is correlated to Homa-IR, visceral fat, fasting blood sugar and musculoskeletal mass among T2DM with peripheral neuropathy."

For the multivariate analysis, a multiple logistic regression was performed that included the main confounding variables.
Results and conclusion
A multiple logistic regression analysis was performed, adjusting for age, WHR, BMI and gender. The dominant model showed a protective effect compared to the TT genotype (OR = 0.596, IC95% [0.458–0.776]). Discussion. The proportions of native American, European and African ancestry were characterized and no difference was found in the study groups. The protective effect obtained in the dominant model could to be due a regulatory function in the transcription or the processing of the primary transcript. Our result are the first to report an association between the polymorphism rs1256031 and the reduction of the risk of T2D in the Mexican population.

To assess the association of dairy consumption and dietary calcium intake with general and abdominal obesity in a large sample of Iranian adults.
Methods
In this cross-sectional study, dairy consumption and dietary calcium intake were assessed using a validated dish-based 106-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire in 6582 Iranian adults aged 18–55 years living in Isfahan. A self-administered validated questionnaire was used to collect data on anthropometric measures. Overweight or obesity was considered as body mass index ≥25 kg/m2, and abdominal obesity as waist circumference ≥88 cm for women and ≥102 cm for men.
Results
Mean age of study participants was 36.8 ± 8.1 years. Compared with the lowest quartile, men in the highest quartile of dietary calcium intake had greater odds for general obesity (OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.03-1.60). This relationship was significant even after adjustment for age and energy intake (OR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.03-1.60). However, such relationship was not seen in women. No other significant associations were observed between dairy and dietary calcium intake with general or abdominal obesity.

All controlled clinical trials involving patients with T2DM, comparing yoga as an intervention with physical exercise and evaluating glycaemic control and other outcomes between the intervention and control groups were included in the analysis. Eight studies were eligible to be included in the systematic review. In total, 842 participants were assigned to a Yoga intervention or a control group with an Exercise intervention and the age range of participants was 30–78 years. A significant reduction in FBG (15.16 mg/dl), PPBG (28.66 mg/dl), HbA1c (0.39%) and BMI (0.71 kg/m2) was noted in the intervention group (‘Yoga’) compared to the control group (‘Physical Exercise’) in the pooled analysis. We did not observe any significant difference between the two groups for lipid parameters, other body composition measures (WC and WHR) and Blood Pressure. In conclusion, our results show that Yoga has beneficial effects on glycaemic control in comparison to physical exercise in T2DM However, individual studies showed considerable heterogeneity.

Therefore, PRL level changes in type II diabetes and it can be concluded that PRL can play an important role in metabolic disorders of glucose. The present study is carried out in order to investigate the association between serum levels of PRL and type II DM. Blood samples were taken from 64 females affected by type II diabetes and 70 healthy ones, whose PRL level was measured using electrochemiluminescence (ECL) technique. It was a case-control study, and based on the definition dedicated to each group, subjects were assigned to two groups. The patient group included the subjects with type II diabetes while the control group included healthy samples. Data were analyzed using SPSS software (Mann-Whitney test, t-test, and spearman's rho correlation test). According to the results, PRL concentration in the serum of people affected by type II diabetes (5.32 ± 0.36) was significantly (P˂0.05) lower than that of control group (18.38 ± 2.3). The results also showed that in type II diabetes, the level of PRL changes so that the concentration of PRL in the serum of the patients was lower than that of healthy ones. Therefore, PRL concentration in the blood can be related to diabetes."

This study aimed to identify the gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) prevalence of low risk pregnant population at a tertiary referral center by different approaches.
Material and methods
A cross-sectional study using retrospective data between 2007-2017 was conducted. During this period 77227 patients underwent either two step or one step glucose tolerance tests.
Results
The median age of the study population was 27 (15–49). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) testing was evaluated in 144,113 women at the initial antenatal care visit which %21 of these were between 92-126 mg/dL. Of these women %1.25 had FPG>126 mg/dL which showed the prevalence of pregestational diabetes in our cohort. During the study period 74412 women underwent 50-g glucose challenge test where %18 were screen positive and % 2.9 was defined as gestational diabetic without need for further testing (>180 mg/dL). The screening positive patients were sent to 100-g oral glucose tolerance test and the prevalence of GDM with two-step screening was 5.5%. A total of 2815 patients were screened by 75-g glucose tolerance test and the prevalence of GDM with one-step screening was 21%. Overall 4684 patients have been diagnosed as gestational diabetes mellitus with the prevalence of 6.07%.
Conclusion
Fasting plasma glucose >92 mg/dL is challenging in our population due to improper fasting. The FPG dependent GDM prevalence is almost four times higher than two-step glucose screening test results (21.8% vs 5.5%). If FPG levels will be used for diagnosing GDM then the values must be checked in a second laboratory analysis."

Fasting blood glucose is the current protocol for assessing metabolic impairment. However, recent studies have shown young adults may have normal fasting blood glucose levels with underlying irregularities in postprandial glucose regulation, insulin secretion and cortisol release, which causes a pattern of visceral fat accumulation. Visceral fat of the volunteers was assessed using the DXA (Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) full body scanning method; the waist was assessed by taking the circumference at the midpoint between the lower margin of the last palpable rib and the top of the iliac crest to formulate a waist to height ratio (WHtR); fasting glucose levels were measured via point-of-care (POC) finger-stick method using the Abbott Precision blood glucose meter and anxiety levels. The Pearson R correlation test showed significance between GAD-7 and VAT Volume at r = 0.513 VAT Mass r = 0.514 body fat percentage r = 0.407 and Android r = 0.419. This correlation between GAD-7 and VAT Volume and VAT Mass shows the physiological connection between elevated visceral fat and heightened anxiety. High amounts of visceral fat may lead to an increase in insulin and cortisol levels. The study may suggest that increased fasting blood glucose is not necessarily the best predictor of metabolic dysregulation in a population of healthy college students."

abstract = "Aims
The study was conducted to ascertain whether chronic stress and sense of coherence are associated with risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Methods
Stress questionnaires - Presumptive Stressful Life Events Scale (PSLES), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Sense of Coherence (SOC) - were administered to 500 Newly Detected Diabetes Mellitus (NDDM) cases and 500 Normal Glucose Tolerance (NGT) controls recruited following 75 g OGTT. Assessment of stress was completed before the diagnosis of diabetes was revealed to them.
Results
PSLES and PSS scores were significantly higher and SOC score was significantly lower in NDDM subjects compared to those with NGT. PSLES and PSS correlated positively with anthropometric parameters (waist circumference, BMI), glycemic parameters (FPG, 2 hPG, A1C) and HOMA-IR and inversely with HOMA-β whereas SOC correlated inversely with glycemic parameters (FPG, 2 hPG, A1C) and HOMA-IR and positively with HOMA-β. In stepwise logistic regression analysis, SOC emerged as the strongest independent predictor of diabetes (OR: 0.774) after HOMA-IR (OR: 1.621) and BMI (OR: 1.288). Other significant predictors included PSS (OR:1.153), PSLES-LT (OR: 1.005) and HOMA-β (OR: 0.894).
Conclusion
Chronic stress and low sense of coherence are associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus."

Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a major health burden worldwide. Patients with type 2 DM has various complications, including impaired bone health. Adiponectin is novel adipocytokine that could influence bone metabolism.
Objective
We investigated the relationships between serum adiponectin versus lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) in type 2 diabetic osteoporotic postmenopausal women.
Subjects and methods
This study is a case control study included 90 postmenopausal women; divided as (group A) composed of 30 type 2 diabetic osteoporotic postmenapausal,(group B) composed of 30 non diabetic osteoporotic postmenopausal and 30 apparently healthy non osteoporotic postmenopausal women as a control group. All participants underwent Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry to measure the lumbar Bone Mineral Density (BMD).Serum adiponectin was measured by ELISA Kits. SPSS was used to analyze the data.
Results
Among the studied subjects, group B showed a significant negative correlation between serum adiponectin and lumbar BMD. The diabetic osteoporotic postmenapausal group (group B) showed the lowest concentration of serum adiponectin (μg/mL): 5.14 compared with 11.02 and 8.63 in group A, and the control, respectively. Lumbar BMD of group B was significantly higher than that of group A.
Conclusions
Serum adiponectin is associated with lumber BMD in diabetic osteoporotic postmenopausal women. These findings suggest that serum adiponectin was involved in bone metabolism in this group."

This study was done to assess the risk factors associated with diabetic foot ulcer-free survival in patients with diabetes.
Materials and Methods
Based on a prospective cohort study, ADFC (Ahvaz Diabetic Foot Cohort) study, carried out in a university hospital, all of the patients with diabetes were followed up for new diabetic foot ulcer (DFU). The time of ulcer development was final outcome during two years in the present study. To analyze the data, the variables were first evaluated by univariate analysis. Subsequently variables with P value <0.2 were tested in multivariate analysis, using backward elimination multiple Cox regression.
Results
From among 605 eligible patients of ADFC study, 566 patients without foot ulcer were included for a 2- years follow-up. Thirty subjects (5.3%) developed DFU during the study course none of whom underwent amputation. The DFU-free survival rate was 0.945 over two years of follow-up. In final multivariate Cox regression analysis, the variables which remained in the model and had a statistically significant relationship with time to develop foot ulcer were: dyslipidemia, history of DFU or amputation, nephropathy callus formation in the feet and diabetes duration. Foot deformity and patients' training about self-care of their feet were statistically borderline significant.
Conclusions
The DFU-free survival rate was 0.945 over two years of follow-up. In this study, independent risk factors associated with ulcer-free survival in diabetic foot patients were dyslipidemia, prior history of DFU or amputation, diabetic nephropathy, callus formation in the feet and diabetes duration."

The detection process of diabetes is a tedious and multilayered task from some important risk factors. Like other diseases, Type2 diabetes also depends on some factors that are known as risk factors of Type2 diabetes. Risk factors are divided into four categories like Scio-economic condition, Habits, Family History and Hard Diseases etc. in proposed system. Initially 731 diabetes and non-diabetes patient’s data have been collected from different diagnostic centers, pre-processed and clustered for identifying relevant and non-relevant data. Significant factors are discovered according to four categories. Next correlation is assessment among significant factors. Finally highly significant factors are discovered whose are directly or indirectly associated with type2 diabetes.

Renal tubulo-interstitial damage has an important role in the pathogenesis of early diabetic nephropathy. Urinary biomarkers can help in the detection of early nephropathy in type 2 diabetic patients. The aim of this study was to estimate the levels of urinary neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL) and cystatin-C in type 2 diabetic patients with early diabetic nephropathy & to compare them with diabetic patients without nephropathy and to correlate urinary NGAL and cystatin-C levels with microalbuminuria in them.
Study design
Cross-sectional comparative study.
Material and methods
The study was conducted on 126 patients with type 2 diabetes along with 30 control subjects attending the outpatient care department of a tertiary care teaching hospital. There were 3 study groups-diabetic patients with microalbuminuria, diabetic patients without albuminuria and control subjects who were non-diabetic without any renal disease. Details on duration of diabetes and glycemic status were obtained from the patients. Urine examination was done for subjects in all the groups to look for microalbuminuria along with estimation of NGAL and cystatin-C levels. Samples were stored at −20 °C in the deep freezer.
Results
Urinary NGAL and cystatin-C levels were significantly elevated in patients with microalbuminuria (228.18 & 3.23 ng/ml) as compared to those without albuminuria (146.12 & 2.61 ng/ml) and in control subjects (26.56 & 0.30 ng/ml). Urinary NGAL and cystatin-C levels showed a linear correlation with microalbuminuria in diabetic patients.
Conclusion
Urinary NGAL and cystatin-C levels were increased in type 2 diabetic patients with early diabetic nephropathy as compared to patients without nephropathy. Urine NGAL and cystatin-C levels also showed a positive correlation with microalbuminuria (urine albumin-creatinine ratio) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."

Cardiometabolic index (CMI), calculated as the product of waist-to-height ratio and triglycerides-to-HDL cholesterol ratio, has been proposed as a discriminator of diabetes and has been reported to be associated with progression of atherosclerosis. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between alcohol drinking and CMI in men with diabetes.
Methods
The subjects were Japanese male workers aged from 35 to 65 years with diabetes mellitus (n = 1411). The subjects were divided by average daily alcohol consumption (g ethanol/day) into 4 categories of alcohol drinking (nondrinkers; light drinkers, < 22; moderate drinkers, ≥ 22 and < 44; heavy drinkers, ≥ 44). CMI and variables comprising CMI were compared in the nondrinker and each of the drinker groups. Age, habits of smoking and regular exercise, and a present history of medication therapy for diabetes were adjusted in each analysis.
Results
Log-transformed CMI was significantly lower in light and moderate drinkers than in nondrinkers. Waist-to-height ratio was significantly lower in moderate drinkers than in nondrinkers, while log-transformed triglycerides was significantly higher in heavy drinkers than in nondrinkers. HDL cholesterol tended to be higher with an increase of alcohol consumption. Odds ratios with their 95% confidence intervals vs. nondrinkers for high CMI were 0.53 (0.36–0.78) in light drinkers, 0.61 (0.46–0.80) in moderate drinkers, and 0.74 (0.55–1.00) in heavy drinkers.
Conclusions
In men with diabetes, CMI is lower in light-to-moderate drinkers than in nondrinkers, and this results mainly from a positive association between alcohol drinking and HDL cholesterol."

Methods
This is a prospective case-control study evaluating the effect of weight loss by sleeve gastrectomy among obese PCOS patients.
Results
There was a 36.28% of weight loss among obese PCOS and 33.04% among the control group at 12 months. Both groups showed a significant increase in the adiponectin levels at 3, 6 and 12 months’ post-surgery. The rate of increase was higher in the obese non PCOS women (4.93 ± 1.79–9.79 ± 3.9) compared to obese PCOS women (5.05 ± 1.98–7.25 ± 0.21). The CRP levels decreased with weight loss after the surgery to reach statistical significance at 3 months in obese PCOS group (4.18 ± 3.94, p = 0.048).
Conclusion
The degree of weight loss after surgery was effective in lowering CRP and increasing adiponectin levels in PCOS women. However, this improvement was slower compared to obese non PCOS patients. A genetic predisposition to insulin resistance might explain these findings."

Numerous clinical trials have shown that sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors exert a favorable effect on the indices of renal function (albuminuria, glomerular filtration rate decline over time) and the incidence of hard renal endpoints such as renal death or time to initiation of renal replacement therapy.
Materials and methods
In this review, we describe in detail the evidence regarding the nephroprotective mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibitors and describe the risk factors that may predispose to the development of acute kidney injury in patients receiving these drugs.
Results
Although the impact of these drugs on renal hemodynamics seems to represent the most important renoprotective mechanism of action, many other effects of these compounds, including beneficial effects on metabolism and blood pressure, have been proposed to contribute to the observed clinical benefit.
Conclusions
SGLT2 inhibitors clearly act beneficially in terms of kidney function with many proposed mechanisms."

To determine the association between serum levels of vitamin B12 and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in a population of euthyroid adults.
Materials and methods
We carried out an analytical cross-sectional study in euthyroid adults of both sexes, who attended the outpatient service of a private clinic in Lima-Peru during the 2012–2016 period. Participants were divided into tertiles (low, intermediate and high) according to their serum vitamin B12 values. MetS was defined when three or more metabolic criteria were met by the participants. We elaborated crude and adjusted Poisson regression models to evaluate the association between the serum vitamin B12 tertiles and the presence of MetS. The reported association measure was the prevalence ratio (PR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).
Results
We analyzed 346 participants, the average age was 38.3 ± 10.8 (SD) years, 117 (33.8%) were males, the serum vitamin B12 median was 364.1 (IQR: 274.2–473.4) pmol/L and the prevalence of MetS was 30.1% (n = 104). In the crude Poisson regression model, we found an association between the serum vitamin B12 tertiles and the presence of MetS, with marginal significance. The association gained statistical significance in the adjusted model by potential confounders; and compared with the low serum vitamin B12 tertile, the prevalence of MetS was 36% lower (aPR = 0.64; 95%CI: 0.43–0.96) among the high tertile group.
Conclusion
Euthyroid participants with elevated levels of serum vitamin B12 showed a lower prevalence of MetS compared to those who had low levels of this marker."

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between vitamin D status and metabolic dyslipidemia and the hypertriglyceridemic waist phenotype.
Methods
This cross-sectional study was conducted on 265 healthy Tehran adults. Hypertriglyceridemic waist phenotype (HTGWP) was described as serum triacylglycerol concentrations >150 mg/dL and concurrent WC > 88 cm (women) and >102 cm (men). Dyslipidemia was defined as: 1) TG level of >150 mg/dL 2) HDL > 40 mg/dL for men or >50 mg/dL for women, as has been previously described.
Results
Current study’s results demonstrated that HTGWP was significantly associated with weight, age, WC, hip, fat percent, TG, lipid profile, ALT and BMI. We found 77% reduction in the chances of developing metabolic dyslipidemia in suficient satus of vitamin D in compare to deficiency, although the significancy was mariginal, OR: 0.33, 95% CI of 0.09 to 1.21, P = 0.09.

Methods
Type 2 diabetes patients who fasted during Ramadan and were on three or more anti-diabetic medications were studied for two weeks using flash glucose monitoring. The patients were asked to document all episodes of hypoglycaemia and were classified as active or sedentary according to their daytime activity.
Results
The study included 16 patients of whom 10 were active and 6 were sedentary. There were 13 males and 3 females; mean age was 53.4 ± 6.4 years; mean diabetes duration was 15 ± 5.9 years, and mean HbA1C was 7.9 ± 1.3%. Over the two weeks; there were 7.9 episodes of hypoglycaemia recorded per patient; 50% of which were asymptomatic. There was no difference at baseline in age, BMI, HBA1C, diabetes duration, and anti-diabetic medications between the active and sedentary groups. The active group had better glucose control; median blood glucose was (7.1 (5.1–8.5) vs 10.6 (9.6–11.5) mmol p < 0.01), mean estimated HBA1C was (6.2 ± 1.2% vs 8.3 ± 1.0%; p = 0.047).

Post Ramadan reduction of HbA1c < 7% increased statistically significantly in the intervention group (from 20.8% of patients before Ramadan to 55.8% after Ramadan). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased in the intervention group (P = 0.024). The body weight of the patients did not significantly change in both groups.
Conclusion
There was a significant impact of pre-Ramadan educational program on reduction of hypoglycaemic risk and other acute complications, reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and improvement of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Therefore, it is recommended for the fasting patients especially those with high and very high risk during Ramadan."

abstract = "Background
Autophagy is a process devoted to degrade and recycle cellular components inside mammalian cells through lysosomal system. It plays a main function in the pathophysiology of several diseases. In type 2 diabetes, works demonstrated the dual functions of autophagy in diabetes biology. Studies had approved the role of autophagy in promoting different routes for movement of integral membrane proteins to the plasma membrane. But its role in regulation of GLUT4 trafficking has not been widely observed. In normal conditions, insulin promotes GLUT4 translocation from intracellular membrane compartments to the plasma membrane, while in type 2 diabetes defects occur in this translocation.
Method
Intriguing evidences discussed the contribution of different intracellular compartments in autophagy membrane formation. Furthermore, autophagy serves to mobilise membranes within cells, thereby promoting cytoplasmic components reorganisation. The intent of this review is to focus on the possibility of autophagy to act as a carrier for GLUT4 through regulating GLUT4 endocytosis, intracellular trafficking in different compartments, and translocation to cell membrane.
Results
The common themes of autophagy and GLUT4 have been highlighted. The review discussed the overlapping of endocytosis mechanism and intracellular compartments, and has shown that autophagy and GLUT4 utilise similar proteins (SNAREs) which are used for exocytosis. On top of that, PI3K and AMPK also control both autophagy and GLUT4.
Conclusion
The control of GLUT4 trafficking through autophagy could be a promising field for treating type 2 diabetes."

Sirtuin 1 (SIRT 1) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were implicated in metabolic syndrome (MetS) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) pathophysiology.
Aims and methods
This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate both SIRT 1 and MDA in 30 lean healthy control, 31 normoglycemic MetS subjects and 30 MetS-Pre/T2DM drug naïve. C orrelation studies were established for both biomarkers with adiposity indices [conicity index (CI), waist circumference (WC), weight-to-height (WHtR) ratio, weight-to-hip (WHR) ratio, hip circumference (HC), and body adiposity index (BAI)], hematological indices [red cell distribution width (RDW), mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet-to-lymphcyte ratio (PLR), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR)] and atherogenicity indices (atherogenicity index of plasma (AIP = log10TG/HDL-C ratio), TC/HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C ratios].
Results
SIRT1 levels (ng/mL) were markedly lower in both MetS groups (2.12 ± 0.06 and 2.32 ± 0.19, respectively, vs. controls 4.73 ± 0.15; P < 0.05).

The concern with the incidence of chronic-degenerative diseases is increasing worldwide, and many studies have shown that insufficiency of vitamin D (VD) can be linked to several metabolic disorders.
Aims
Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the association of the metabolic syndrome risk factors, atherogenic indices and VD in a group of patients attended at a Cardiology Center.
Methods
For this study, we invited 200 patients of both sexes attended in a Cardiology Center (Medical School of Marilia – São Paulo – Brazil). Most were female (n = 111) and aged between 41 and 70 years (from march to august, 2017).
Results
Our results showed that only 20.0% of the patients presented normal levels of VD. Patients with altered values for this vitamin presented significantly higher values for glycemia, HbA1c, Total cholesterol, LDL-c, triglycerides, Castelli Index I, Castelli Index II, Body Mass Index, waist circumference, non-HDL-c and the estimative of the size of the LDL-c particle. Vitamin D correlated negatively with glycemia, HbA1C, triglycerides, atherogenic indices, Body Mass Index, and blood pressure. Multiple Regression Model showed that for an individual to maintain metabolic parameters, at least at borderline values, the levels of VD should be 37.64 that is not in accordance with the reference values.
Conclusions
These results showed a remarkable prevalence of low concentrations of Vitamin D in patients with cardiovascular risk factors."

To study the association of documented hypoglycemia with length of stay, 30-day mortality, and 1-year mortality, among patients with and without diabetes admitted to internal medicine units.
Methods
The electronic medical records of all patients hospitalized in internal medicine departments at E. Wolfson Medical Center, Holon, Israel, between 1/1/2010 and 31/12/2013, were reviewed. Data extracted included all glucose measurements (performed using an institutional blood glucose monitoring system). Patients were considered hypoglycemic if at least one hypoglycemic event was recorded. Regression analysis was used to assess the association between documented hypoglycemia and length of stay, 30-day and one-year mortality. Age, sex, reason for admission, and the Charlson comorbidity index were entered as covariates, and the most conservative model was developed.
Results
The study population included 45,272 patients (mean age 68.9 ± 17.8 years, 49.4% males, 21.0% had diabetes mellitus). The rate of hypoglycemia in the total study population was 7.5% (16.8% among DM patients, 6.0% among patients without diabetes, p < 0.001). Patients with documented hypoglycemia had a longer length of hospital stay (9.3 ± 18.7 vs. 3.1 ± 6.4 days, p < 0.001), as well as higher risk for both 30-day (23.7% vs. 7.0%, p < 0.001) and 1-year mortality (41.6% vs. 15.3%, p < 0.001). Cox regression analysis showed that hypoglycemia significantly increased risk death at one year (HR 2.436, 95% CI 2.298–2.582, p < 0.001) independent of age, sex, the Charlson comorbidity index, DM status and reason for admission.
Conclusion
Documented hypoglycemia is associated with prolonged length of hospital stay and increased risk for both 30-day and 1-year mortality, regardless of diabetes mellitus status."

abstract = "Background
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a serine protease and a secreted protein which increases cholesterol levels in plasma via inducing degradation of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). Cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) is a member of a family of cell surface proteins in many cells. CD36 is known as fatty acid translocase (FAT) because it imports fatty acids inside cells and participate in triglyceride storage. It has been suggested that PCSK9 regulates CD36 in some tissues.
Methods
Data and serum levels of TSH, FT4, lipid profile and PCSK9 and the expression of CD36 on monocytes from 40 new untreated patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) and 40 age- sex- and BMI-matched euthyroid controls were analyzed in a cross-sectional study. Then the relationships between these parameters were examined.
Results
Patients with SH had higher TSH, FT4, total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and PCSK9 levels than controls. There were significant and positive correlations between serum TSH levels and lipid parameters except HDL-C. PCSK9 had a significant and negative correlation with FT4. No significant correlation could be found in relation to PCSK9 and CD36.
Conclusions
PCSK9 inhibitors are used to reduce blood cholesterol levels as drugs. If it will be proven that PCSK9 can induce CD36 degradation, taking these drugs may have unwanted side effects. This study showed that serum PCSK9 and lipid profile levels increase in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and there is no relationship between PCSK9 and CD36 in these patients."

abstract = "Background
Diabetic foot ulcers are the leading cause of non-traumatic lower extremity amputation. The aim of this study was to establish short-term predictors of lower extremity amputation (LEA) in patients with diabetic foot ulcers (DFU).
Methods
A retrospective observational study was performed. Patients observed for the first time in a multidisciplinary outpatient diabetic foot clinic during 1-year were reviewed. We examined demographic and clinical data and the occurrence of LEA within 180 days. Bivariate descriptive analysis was performed and three logistic regression models were created to predict short-term LEA.
Results
During 1-year 613 patients were observed for the first time in our diabetic foot clinic. Relevant data and eligibility was available from 479 patients with DFU; 38.41%, 40,71% and 20,88% had neuropathic, neuroischemic and ischemic ulcers, respectively. Considering a follow-up of 180 days, amputation occurred in 10.02% (n = 48) of patients: 3.13% (n = 15) major amputation and 6.89% (n = 33) minor amputation. Independent predictors of short-term LEA included moderate to severe infection [OR 5.23 (IC 95% 2.51–10.80; p < 0.001)], previous history of LEA [OR 3.93 (IC 95% 1.81–8.53; p = 0.001)], peripheral arterial disease [OR 3.51 (IC 95% 1.29–9.58; p = 0.014)] and presence of any walking disability [OR 3.35 (IC 95% 1.58–7.13; p = 0.002)].
Conclusion
In DFU patients the risk of LEA at 180 days is associated to moderate to severe infection at the initial presentation, previous history of LEA, peripheral arterial disease and presence of any walking disability. To prevent future amputations these patients should be identified early and managed by a multidisciplinary team. Level of Clinical Evidence: Level 2."

Hypertension (HTN), dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease, accounting for the highest morbidity and mortality among the elderly Jordanian population. This study aimed to evaluate serum lipid and glucose profiles of hypertensive patients and normotensive controls, and determine the risk factors for HTN among elderly population in Jordan.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was carried out among 200 participants, including 111 hypertensive patients and 89 normotensive controls from June to October 2017 in North Jordan. Data were collected on sociodemographic factors, anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, and lipid profile including total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL) and fasting blood sugar (FBS).
Results
Serum levels of TC, TG, LDL and FBS were higher while HDL levels were lower in hypertensive subjects compared to normotensives (p < 0.01). There were no differences between hypertensive and normotensives patients regarding their age, waist circumference (WC), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) and body mass index (BMI). Anthropometric and biochemical parameters were significantly correlated only in normotensive group. Significant associations between blood pressure and biochemical parameters were seen only in the HTN group. Overweight/obesity, abdominal obesity (WHtR), hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL were found as the risk factors for HTN.
Conclusion
from our results, future strategies for preventing dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia and, consequently, HTN through modification of risk factors such as lifestyle changes and medical management. It's recommended for patients with HTN to measure the BP, lipid and glucose profiles regularly throughout their primary health care to prevent non-communicable diseases."

abstract = "Objective
The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of obesity, overweight and hypertension in children and adolescents aged 10–15 in Ahvaz.
Methods
This is a epidemiologic study performed on 176 people aged 10–15 in Ahvaz. In 2009, 300 people underwent weight, height and blood pressure measurements. Five years later, the same people were reassessed for obesity, overweight and hypertension, of whom a total of 176 people agreed to repeat the procedure.
Results
The study included 100 (57%) males and 76 (43%) females. Mean BMI was 22.1 ± 4.3 kg / m2 in year 2014, without any significant difference between the two sexes (P = 0.518). In the same year, the prevalence of obesity and overweight was 26 (14.8%) and 13 (7.4%), respectively. After 5years, BMI increased significantly (P < 0.001). Of the 150 norma participants with normal BMI in 2009, 15 (10%) and 6 (4%) became overweight and obese in 2014 respectively. The mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures increased significantly over 5 years P = 0.042 and P < 0.001.
Conclusions
This study shows an increase in mean BMI and mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures after 5 years among people aged 10–15 in Ahvaz."

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of vision loss in the working age population. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), are molecules involved in extracellular tissue matrix remodelling. They are implicated in the loss of retinal tissue integrity, a major cause of DR, that leads to retinal tissue degradation and apoptosis. This study is therefore, conducted to compare the serum levels of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in T2DM patients without and with retinopathy, and to evaluate their association with the severity of DR.
Materials and methods
Our study comprised of 2 groups of 41 each. Group A (cases) included T2DM patients with retinopathy and Group B (controls) included T2DM patients without retinopathy. Routine parameters, mainly, fasting blood glucose, and lipid profile were measured using autoanalyzer. Serum MMP-9, TIMP-1, and insulin levels were assessed using ELISA method.
Results and conclusion
Statistically significant increase in the levels of MMP-9, insulin, fasting blood glucose and lipid profile were observed in the serum of T2DM patients with retinopathy, as compared with those without retinopathy. These results help to conclude that rise in MMP-9, and associated serum markers promote disease progress in DR. These findings suggest that the elevations of our study markers in the serum of the type 2 diabetic patients with retinopathy, as compared to those without retinopathy, play important roles in aggravating tissue matrix degradation, supporting DR disease progression."

Hypoglycemia can be considered the most common complication of Diabetes Mellitus treatment. So far, controversial studies have been carried out to examine the impacts of hypoglycemia on the cognitive function.
Methods
This study was conducted as case-control. The case group was 35 patients with Diabetes Mellitus Types I or II hospitalized in Imam Hussein Hospital, Tehran, Iran, who have experienced hypoglycemic attacks (glucose level below 70 mg/dl). The control group consisted of diabetic patients hospitalized in hospital, but they had no history of hypoglycemia. As the blood glucose level became in normal range and the patients’ Mental status became stable, the brain cognitive function was examined using Mini-Mental State test.
Results
The mean age of the subjects in the case and control groups was 56.77, 53.73 years old, respectively. The mean cognitive score in the control and hypoglycemic groups was 29.09 and 25.29, respectively. The mean MMSE cognitive score was significantly diminished in the hypoglycemic group (p < 0.001).
Conclusions
This study indicated that incidence of hypoglycemia in diabetic patients is associated with cognitive disorders. Further, there is a linear association between cognitive disorders and hypoglycemia, age and diabetes mellitus complication."

Xultophy is the first fixed co-formulation pen containing insulin degludec and the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue liraglutide, authorized for type 2 diabetes patients since 2014. The aim was to review the clinical effectiveness of Xultophy across two hospitals in Wales.
Methods
Retrospective review of patients commenced on Xultophy between April 2016 and January 2018 was taken. Data related to glycemic control, weight and medication use were collected.
Results
Ninety-one patients were initiated on Xultophy, and 60 patients had follow-up for at least 6 months with a mean age of 57.3 years (47% male). Xultophy was well-tolerated, however, abdominal cramps and nausea limited use in three patients. Baseline HbA1c and weight were 84.7 mmol/mol and 101.5 kg. There were significant HbA1c reductions of 9.9 mmol/mol (p < 0.0001) and 13.4 mmol/mol (p < 0.008) at 6 and 12 months, and non-significant changes in weight. Patients with an HbA1c over 84 mmol/mol showed the greatest HbA1c improvement over 6-months. Those prescribed insulin prior to Xultophy had less significant improvements in HbA1c than those previously prescribed GLP-1 analogues.
Conclusions
There were significant reductions in HbA1c and statistically insignificant weight gain over 12 months. Switching from GLP-1 analogues to Xultophy was associated with a greater HbA1c reduction compared to switching from insulin."

Several abdominal obesity measures have been used for prediction of 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk but the superiority of these measures remains controversial. The objective of this study was to assess the predictive ability of abdominal obesity measures for risk of CVD events in an Iranian adult population.
Methods
We analyzed the data of population based cross-section study of 567 representative samples of adult population aged 40–70 years in Babol, the north of Iran. The demographic data, the anthropometric measures, lipid profile and cardiometabolic risk factors were measured with standard methods. Waist to hip ratio (WHR), waist to height ratio (WHtR), conicity index(CI), abdominal volume index (AVI) and body mass index(BMI)were calculated. The individual 10-year CVD risk was estimated based on ACC/AHA model. ROC analysis was performed to assess the diagnostic ability of different abdominal obesity measures and body mass index (BMI) in predicting of high risk of CVD events.
Results
About 42.5% of men and 15% of women had at least 10% risk of 10-year cardiovascular events and 21.1% of men and 3.0% of women had ≥20% risk. Except WHR for men, all abdominal obesity measures significant predictors for ≥10% risk CVD risk in both sexes but not BMI. The greater ability of CVD risk prediction was observed by WHtR and CI in both sexes with higher AUC in females compared with men for ≥10% risk.
Conclusion
WHtR and CI are superior indexes in predicting of high risk of CVD events in both sexes."

Hyperglycemia is the driving force for the development of diabetic nephropathy leading to the end stage renal disease. It is well known that in hyperglycaemic condition, serum proteins become glycated through non-enzymatic glycation. With the other risk factors, serum fructosamine may be an important risk factor for kidney impairment. To assess coexistence of frequently documented risk factors of kidney dysfunction with serum fructosamine in diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Methods
In this study, total 150 individuals, as control, type2 diabetic patients without complication and with CKD were included. Blood samples were collected from all the samples to estimate blood glucose, HbA1c, serum creatinine, fructosamine levels and lipid profile. Statistical analysis i.e. regression and correlation between serum fructosamine and other documented risk factors for diabetic CKD has been done. P < 0.001 was considered significant.
Results
Serum fructosamine, HbA1c, creatinine levels, cholesterol and LDL were increased significantly (P < 0.001) in diabetic patients with CKD compared to without complications. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and BMI were also significantly higher in diabetic patients compared to control. Serum creatinine, total cholesterol and LDL showed a significant positive correlation but HDL showed a negative correlation with fructosamine in CKD diabetic patients. No significant correlation was found with any risk factors in diabetic patients without complications expect HbA1c.
Conclusion
It is concluded that elevated serum fructosamine level is strongly associated with kidney dysfunction in diabetic patients. As there is a significant link between serum fructosamine and other risk factors for CKD diabetic patients."

To determine whether hs-CRP level and interval change of hs-CRP could predict the development of metabolic abnormalities in healthy subjects in a longitudinal study.
Methods
A cohort of 3748 male who had normal hs-CRP level without evidence of any component of metabolic syndrome were studied. At each visit, hs-CRP level and metabolic abnormalities were measured. Interval change of hs-CRP for each subject was calculated. COX proportional hazard model and logistic regression analysis were used.
Results
Cumulative incidence and incidence density of metabolic syndrome were 3.96% and 7.17 per 1000 person-year, respectively. Cumulative incidence of metabolic syndrome was significantly increased according to hs-CRP tertile level. This significance remained after adjusting age, smoking, drinking, and exercise. Although the hazard ratio of metabolic syndrome for incidence density was increased significantly as hs-CRP increased, such trend disappeared after adjusting for confounding variables. The risk of metabolic syndrome was significantly higher (1.48 times) in the hs-CRP increased group than that in the decreased or unchanged group. This significance remained after controlling for covariates.
Conclusion
Relatively higher hs-CRP level within normal range may predict the increase of metabolic syndrome compared to lower hs-CRP. Increased hs-CRP level may increase the incidence of metabolic syndrome."

abstract = "Backgrounds
Iron deficiency has been studied extensively in patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis therapy. However, few studies looked at iron treatment in the non-dialysis chronic kidney disease population.
Methods
Five hundred and eighty patients were studied (247 were diabetic persons). Patients were divided into 4 groups: non-diabetic subjects without CKD, non-diabetic ones with GFR < 60 mL/min, diabetic persons without CKD and diabetic ones with GFR < 60 mL/min). Iron deficiency was diagnosed when serum ferritin level was <100 mg/dl. It was defined as diminished iron availability when ferritin was above 100 mg/dl and serum transferrin saturation (TSAT) was <20%.
Results
Anemia was more frequent in the diabetic CKD patients group (52.4%, p < 0.001). Anemia prevalence was also higher in all CKD patients as well as in diabetic patients compared with non-diabetic ones. Iron deficiency was more frequent in diabetic patients. Among CKD diabetic patients the prevalence of iron deficiency was higher than in non-diabetic CKD ones. Diminished iron availability prevalence was higher in non-diabetic patients. Logistic regression analysis showed that only sex and diabetes mellitus were independently associated with iron deficiency.
Conclusions
Anemia was more common in diabetic CKD patients. Diabetes mellitus was independently associated with iron deficiency. Surprisingly, diminished iron availability was not more frequent in diabetic patients. The physio-pathological mechanisms that could explain these findings remain to be elucidated."

abstract = "The evolution of human from ancient times to modern era has witnessed several environmental and social changes which contributed to genetic and epigenetic makeup of human beings and in turn is responsible for its present phenotype. In the recent past, owing to socioeconomic developmental pressure, a large epidemiologic shift towards non-communicable disease pattern has been noticed in many developing countries including India which resulted into incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases in epidemic proportion. These two pathologies form a subset associated with metabolic derangement, popularly termed as metabolic syndrome. Earlier its status and the pathophysiological rationale were largely obscure and hence it was given a rather disguised name – Syndrome X, as an icon of unknown. While initially contemplated to be an endocrine problem associated with insulin resistance, the scientific insight about this pathology has undergone a gradual evolution. Therefore the pathogenic and consequent diagnostic modality consistently changed. Quite fascinatingly its phenomenal conversion from an endocrine etiopathology to an inflammatory pathogenesis has imprinted a paradigm shift. From laboratory medicine perspective, these evidences have immense impact to steer the research towards development of the apposite diagnostic modality for this very significant and nationally relevant health problem."

Besides its role in calcium homeostasis, vitamin D (VD) has an important immuno-mudulation effect. However, its role in autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes is under discussion. This study designed to investigate serum VD status in children and adolescents with and without diabetes.
Materials and methods
In a case-control study, 85 diabetic and 85 non-diabetic control (total 170) aged 1–15 yr. were enrolled. History of breast feeding and vitamin supplementation was obtained; growth indices and serum levels of Calcium, phosphorous, Alkaline-Phosphatase (ALP), Hemoglobin-A1c and VD were measured and analyzed.
Results
The mean values for VD in case and control groups were 12.80 ± 10.59 and 15.85 ± 9.92 nmol/L, respectively (p = 0.057). Serum VD status in these two groups was sufficient in 5.88% and 9.41%, insufficient in 18% and 14%, and deficient in 75.29% and 76.74%, respectively. Compared to the controls, diabetics had more history of breast-feeding (62.35% vs. 42.35%; p = 0.017) and higher serum ALP levels (772.34 ± 309.89 vs. 657.99 ± 395.11 U/L; p = 0.032).
Conclusion
More frequency of breast-feeding, higher serum ALP and mildly lower serum level of VD in diabetics suggests a significant difference in VD status in diabetics compared to the healthy peers indicating a potential role of this deficiency in the disease process."

To determine the prevalence and associated risk factors of metabolic syndrome (MS) among industrial workers in Kerala, India.
Materials and methods
We measured fasting plasma glucose (FPG), triglycerides, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure among 2287 industrial workers (mean age 46 years, men 70%) from selected industries of two southern most Kerala districts using standard protocol in 2009. MS was defined according to international diabetes federation (IDF), Adult Treatment Panel (ATP-III) and American Heart Association(AHA)/National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) criteria (Harmonization). Age-standardized prevalence of MS was assessed for men and women. Multivariable logistic regression models were developed to find the associated factors of MS.
Results
Age-standardized prevalence of MS was 14% (men 14%, women 15%), 19% (men 19%, women 21%) and 27% (men 30%, women 21%) as per IDF, ATP-III and Harmonization criteria respectively. Overweight adults were nine times (OR 9.41, 95% CI 7.34–12.06), twelve times (OR 11.80 CI 9.38–14.84), and four times (OR 3.56, CI 2.94–4.29) more likely to have MS compared to their counterparts according to IDF, ATP-III and Harmonization criteria respectively. Older adults and current alcohol users were more likely to have MS compared to their counterparts. Women were more likely to have MS as per IDF and ATP-III criteria.
Conclusions
MS prevalence was high among Industrial workers who generally have good access to health care. Overweight and other predictors of MS need to be addressed to reduce MS prevalence in this population."

abstract = "Background
Evidence from epidemiological studies suggests an important association between gout and the metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, to the best of our knowledge, prevalence of metabolic syndrome in gout has not been reported in sub-Saharan African (SSA) settings.
Objectives
The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of MetS in gout in a SSA population.
Method
After prior ethical clearance, we carried out a cross-sectional study involving gout patients in a referral hospital in Douala-Cameroon. Metabolic syndrome was defined using International Diabetes Foundation criteria. Associations between variables were assessed using logistic regression.p <  0.05 was considered significant.
Results
On 174 gout patients (48.3% females) who consented to participate in the study, the median (IQR) age was 55.00 (14.25) years, and the median (IQR) duration of gout was 7.5 (10.0) years. Prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 54.6% (95% CI: 47.9%–62.8%). One hundred and forty-seven (84.5%) participants had central obesity, 62 (35.6%) raised triglycerides, 79 (45.4%) reduced HDL-C, 129 (74.1%) raised blood pressure, and 85 (48.9%) had raised fasting plasma glucose. On logistic regression analyses, gout patients with metabolic syndrome significantly had a higher body mass index (OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.02–1.17), and higher levels of serum uric acid (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01–1.04).
Conclusions
About 1 out of every 2 gout patients in this population have metabolic syndrome. These gout patients with metabolic syndrome significantly have a higher body mass index, and higher levels of serum uric acid. Cohort studies are required to clearly establish the direction of the relationship between gout and metabolic syndrome."

To compare uric acid, lipid, and kidney profile along with management and complications of Indonesian diabetic patients with good and poor glycemic control based on glycated hemoglobin profile.
Materials and Methods
Data was obtained from medical records of Internal Medicine Clinic in Hermina Podomoro General Hospital for the period January-December 2015. Subjects were grouped into good and poor glycemic control groups based on their glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels.
Results
Fifty-five subjects were obtained with an average age of 54 years, 29 with good glycemic control and 26 with poor glycemic control. All glycemic parameters were worse in poor compared to good glycemic control group (p < 0.05). Similar averages of urea, creatinine, uric acid, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and a lower average of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) were found between both groups with statistically non-significant differences (p > 0.05). Main comorbidities were dyslipidemia, hypertension, and nephropathy. Fatty liver disease, urinary tract infection and neuropathy was also reported. Most patients were prescribed with oral anti-diabetics.
Conclusion
Diabetic patients regardless of glycemic control according to current guidelines have a greater average lipid and kidney profile than the optimum target. Therefore both are equally at greater risk for cardiovascular diseases, nephropathy, and other diabetic complications. Greater patient monitoring of these parameters is recommended to lower the risk of comorbidities and complications."

In Malaysia, 61% of dialysis cases are secondary to diabetes. To date, we are still lacking of data on the rate of progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to end stage renal disease (ESRD) in Malaysia.
Materials and methods
This was a retrospective study conducted at nephrology unit of a tertiary hospital in Kedah. All diabetic ESRD patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were identified and recruited for analysis.
Results
The mean duration of DM to ESRD was found to be 14.37 ± 4.42 years. Mean duration for the onset of diabetic nephropathy was 8.73 ± 3.37 years. There was a relative short duration from diabetic nephropathy to ESRD noted, which was 5.63 ± 2.06 years. The mean duration of DM to ESRD for patients receiving RAAS blocker was found to be 18.23 ± 2.38 years as compared to 11.41 ± 2.94 years for those who did not (95% CI: -0.64 to -2.46). For different type of RAAS blockers, namely ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), there was no significant difference observed pertaining to mean duration of DM to ESRD; 17.89 ± 1.97 years for ACEi and 19.00 ± 4.16 years for ARB (95% CI: -4.74 to 2.52).
Discussion
Time frame from diabetic nephropathy to ESRF among Malaysian population was shorter as compared to findings from other countries with an average period of 15 to 25 years. RAAS blockers should be initiated early in diabetic patients."

To investigate the influence of glycemic variability (GV) on length of stay and in-hospital mortality in non-critical diabetic patients.
Methods
A observation retrospective study was performed. Diabetic patients admitted between January and June 2016 with the diagnosis of community-acquire pneumonia (CAP) and/or acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were enrolled and glycemic control (persistent hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, mean glucose level (MGL) and respective standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV)) were evaluated. Primary outcomes were length of stay and in-hospital mortality.
Results
Data from 242 patients were analyzed. Fifty-eight percent of the patients were male, with a median age of 77 years (min-max, 29–98). Patients had on average 2.1 glucose readings-day and the MGL was 193.3 mg/dl (min-max, 84.3–436.6). Hypoglycemia was documented in 13.4% of the patients and 55.4% had persistent hyperglycemia. The median length of hospital stay was 10 days (min-max, 1–66) and in-hospital mortality was 7.4%. We found a significant higher in-hospital mortality in older patients, with history of cancer and with nosocomial infections. We did not find any correlation between MGL, SD, CV, hypoglycemia or persist hyperglycemia and in-hospital mortality. A longer length of stay was observed in patients with heavy alcohol consumption and nosocomial infections. The length of stay was negatively correlated with the mean glucose level (r2-0.147; p < 0.05) and positively correlated with the coefficient of variation (p 0.162; p < 0.05).

Prehypertension in people with type 2 diabetes is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and lower extremity damages compared to people with normal blood pressure. On the other hand, limited studies have conducted to investigate the effect of DASH diet on blood pressure and prehypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of DASH diet on blood pressure and prehypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Materials and methods
In this clinical trial, 80 patients with diabetes type 2 and prehypertension in the age range of 18–65 years were randomly allocated to intervention (n = 40) and control (n = 40) groups for 12 weeks. The intervention group had DASH diet and the control group received diabetic diet in accordance with the recommendations of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) with 24-h dietary recall; systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured before and after study.
Results
Taking DASH diet and diabetic diet for 12 weeks caused significant reduction in systolic blood pressure in the intervention group (P value = 0.003). Diastolic blood pressure showed no significant change in none of the two groups.
Conclusion
Following the DASH diet in patients with prehypertension has beneficial effects in improving systolic blood pressure and can be effective to prevent the development of hypertension. Hence, there are needs for long-term interventions with larger sample size in future studies."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the most important causes of death in developing countries. The current study evaluates the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), phosphate and calcium levels in patients with angiographically-defined coronary artery disease (CAD) and healthy subjects in a sample population in northeastern Iran.
Methods
There were 566 subjects aged between 20–80 years out of whom283 subjects with CAD were divided into two study groups based on their angiogram results; those with > 50% stenosis of one or more coronary arteries and those with ≤ 50% stenosis. Serum 25OHD levels and anthropometric parameters were measured for all subjects.
Results
There were approximately 53% (n = 303) males and 47% (n = 269) females in the population sample. We found that crude serum 25OHD concentrations were significantly higher in both the Angio− (21.6 ± 11.8 ng/ml) and Angio+ (21.3 ± 10.2 ng/ml) groups compared to the control subjects (16.4 ± 9.5 ng/ml) (P < 0.001).
Conclusion
The findings show that 25OHD state could be a risk factor for CAD, although this would need to be explored further, taking the potential confounding effects of diet into account in future studies."

Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is gold-standard for the assessment of glycemic control in diabetic patients. Previous studies have reported that iron deficiency may elevate A1c concentrations, independent of glycemia. This study aimed to analyze the effect of iron status on HbA1c levels in diabetic patients.
Methods
661 patients 336 females (228 menopausal and 108 premenopausal) and 325 males (237 age> 50 years and 88 age < 50 years) were recruited. HbA1c, ferritin, fasting plasma glucose, hemogram and medical history were recorded. Analysis of variance ANOVA and Pearson’s regression were applied.
Results
patients were divided according gender, age, glycemia and iron status (normal, latent iron deficiency LID, iron deficiency anemia IDA).All groups presented increasing HbA1c values in parallel with iron deficiency, subclinical and anemia, but the level of significance was not homogeneous in the different groups. Controlled premenopausal women HbA1c in normal iron status and IDA groups P = 0.0048, between normal and LID, P = 0.033. Not controlled premenopausal women Normal group and IDAP < 0.001, normal iron status and LID P = 0.019. Controlled menopausal women normal group and IDAP < 0.0001, LID and IDA P = 0.01. Not controlled menopausal women normal group and IDA P = 0.04. Controlled men over 50 years normal and IDA groups P = 0.002, LID and IDA P = 0.02. Controlled young men normal group and LID P = 0.03.
Conclusion
This study found a positive correlation between iron deficiency and increased HA1c levels. In diabetic patients with IDA should be interpreted with caution, due to the possibility of spurious increment in HbA1c."

abstract = "Aims
Various studies have demonstrated that the majority of the factors affecting the reluctance of individuals to insulin injections are rooted in psychological factors. Present study aimed to determine relationships between main causes of refusal to insulin injection in diabetic patients and factors such as age, gender, and educational degree of patients.
Material & Methods
This was a descriptive study which was conducted on diabetic patients (n = 505) who need insulin therapy. The data were collected with a questionnaire in following steps. First, the most important causes of patients’ reluctance, in the patients’ opinion, to insulin therapy were determined using the data of the previous studies. In the second step, the patients were asked to express their opinion on each of these factors and the recorded responses were analyzed.
Results
The results of the study showed that fear of ampoules, fear of pain caused by insulin and the embarrassment of patients from injections in public significantly depended on the gender of the patients, so that these factors were much lower in men than women. In addition, these factors in the patients with higher degrees of education led to lower level of refusal to insulin injections. Another factor influencing the reluctance to insulin injections was the forming of a sense of addiction due to daily insulin injections, which was significantly lower among the patients with higher education, but did not have a significant relationship with sex of the patients. In this regard, another factor was fear of hypoglycemia and insulin side effects, which did not have a significant relationship with gender and educational degree. In addition, there was no significant relationship between the patient's age and any of the factors effective in patients' reluctance to insulin injections.
Conclusion
Psychological factors seem to be effective in the emergence of the sense of reluctance to insulin injections. Therefore, not only patients but also the entire society need to receive training and appropriate services to improve their attitude to this issue with a psychological approach and help to solve this problem."

Methodology
a descriptive analytical cross-sectional study, included 315 of participants with diabetes. The data collection was performed to gather demographic information, prevalence of smoking and presence of complications. In addition to measurement of blood pressure, weight and height measurement for calculation of body mass index and biochemical tests. Statistical association at p.value of 0.05 was measured using T-test for quantitative data and Chi square test for categorical data.
Results
The overall prevalence of smoking was found to be 33.9%. Smoking was statistically significant associated with being male; increase in age; and being married. HbA1c and triglycerides are significantly associated with smoking (P value = 0.01 and 0.05 respectively); therefore, statistical significance was found with ischemic heart disease(IHD) as well (P value = 0.05). Hypertension, duration of diabetes, low density lipoprotein (LDL), cholesterol and body mass index (BMI) were not statistically significant with smoking.
Conclusion
Almost third of the population with diabetes are smokers (33.9%). Smoking is statistically associated with IHD, high triglyceride and HbA1c. Therefore, smoking cessation schemes should be advocated by health authorities and the public in Sudan."

abstract = "Background
Diabetes mellitus is the leading cause of end stage renal disease worldwide. Early identification of diabetic nephropathy even before appearance of microalbuminuria is a challenge for early prevention of occurrence and progression of this complication. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin is a small protein that belongs to the lipocalin protein. Urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin is a promising early marker in different renal problems.
Aim of the work
To measure urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin in type 2 diabetic patients and to assess its role as an early marker for diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy and diabetic retinopathy.
Patient and methods
The current study included 60 subjects with type 2 diabetes and 20 healthy control subjects. Diabetic subjects were divided into 3 groups according to urinary albumin creatinine ratio; 20 normoalbuminuric patients, 20 micro-albuminuric patients and 20 macroalbuminuric patients. They were subjected to history taking, full clinical examination, fundus examination, anthropometric measurement, urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and urinary albumin creatinine ratio.
Results
Urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin was higher in all diabetic groups than in the control group, with no difference in between diabetic groups. The difference was of great value when comparing normoalbuminuric group with control as albumin creatinine ratio was not different while the urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin was statistically significant (5.94 ± 1.85 ng/dl vs 1.96 ± 0.65, p < 0.001). No correlation was found with retinopathy.
Conclusion
Urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin is a sensitive marker for early detection of diabetic nephropathy even in normoalbuminuric patients denoting early tubular damage before microalbuminuria. It is not correlated with retinopathy."

Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the influence of antioxidant vitamins on the efficacy of oral hypoglycemic therapy in type 2 diabetic patients (T2DM). This single-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial aimed to investigate the effect of vitamin C and/or E supplementation on the efficacy of oral hypoglycemic therapy in T2DM Palestinian male patients from the Gaza Strip.
Methods
Forty T2DM male patients aged 40–60 years on metformin treatment were randomly divided into four groups, each group received an additional one of the following daily oral supplements for 90 days: placebo; vitamin C; vitamin E and vitamin C plus vitamin E. After overnight fasting, venous blood specimens were collected from all individuals into K3-EDTA tubes and serum tubes for measuring the biochemical and hematological parameters of the study at baseline and after 90 days of vitamins supplementation.
Results
The results revealed that vitamin C and/or E improve fasting blood sugar (FBS), HbA1c, lipid profile, insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), reduced glutathione (GSH); and Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QISCI) compared with diabetic patients group that received placebo.
Conclusion
This study provided additional evidence on the beneficial effects of supplementing antioxidant vitamins in T2DM which could improve the clinical condition and attenuate or prevent diabetic pathogenesis and complications that, secondly to poor glycemic control, could attribute to the imbalance between the decline in the endogenous antioxidants and increasing production of the reactive oxygen species leading to the oxidant-mediated damage present in the diabetic context."

Expeditious and precise discerning of bacterial pathogens is a fundamental grail, of clinical diagnostic microbiology. Genotypic detection is a budding substitute to recognize phenotypic culture based processes in bacterial identification.
Aims
We report a comparative evaluation of biochemical and genomic-based assays for exploring the commonest bacterial flora of infected diabetic foot ulcers along with clinical variables of subjects enrolled.
Methods
The pathogens selected (i) Staphylococcus aureus ii) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, iii) Escherichia coli and iv) Klebsiella pneumonia, stood for the most frequent isolates of diabetic foot infection in previous studies from Northern India. Identification of these pathogens were done by conventional assays and polymerase chain reaction.
Results
Of 50 specimens obtained from infected DFUs, 74% of cases were affirmative by bacteriological assays and 90% showed positivity via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Among processed samples 44 isolates were detectable through phenotypic analysis and 65 bacteria by species-specific PCR. Thirteen samples and 21 isolates could not be scrutinized by phenotypic identification systems. The most prevalent pathogens identifiable were Klebsiella pneumonia, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli.
Conclusions
We have shown that PCR-based diagnostic methods improved the identification compared to conventional methods and highlight the incorporation of PCR due to shorten turnaround time translating into improved clinical outcomes."

abstract = "Aim
This study compared the ability of anthropometric parameters to predict Metabolic Syndrome (MetS).
Methods
Eleven anthropometric parameters: waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), a body shape index (ABSI), body roundness index (BRI), visceral adiposity index (VAI), abdominal volume index (AVI), Conicity Index (CI), body adiposity index (BAI), lipid accumulation product (LAP) and waist circumference-triglyceride index (WTI) were measured and calculated in apparently healthy subjects with and without MetS. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was applied to assess their ability to predict MetS.
Results
Of the 535 subjects recruited 23% had MetS. WC had the largest area under the curve (AUC) in both men (0.814 95% CI 0.721–0.907) and women (0.819 95%CI 0.771–0.867). This did not differ from the AUC of BMI, WHtR, BRI, CI, BAI, LAP in men and BMI, WHtR, BAI, LAP, VAI and WTI in women (P > 0.05). The cutoff point for WC was 89.5 cm and 91.8 cm in men and women respectively. The AUC of WC was the largest in the 40–49 and 60 years and above age groups while the AUC of LAP was the largest for age groups 30–39 and 50–59 years.
Conclusion
Of the 11 anthropometric parameters assessed, the WC was the best at predicting MetS in both men and women. There is need to ascertain the cutoff point and establish landmark for measuring WC especially for the sub Saharan region."

Early identification of at-risk groups is an important step in preventing gestational diabetes and its subsequent side effects. This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors of gestational diabetes based on the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups criteria in Ahvaz.
Material and Methods
In a cross-sectional case control study, 520 pregnant women involving life after gestational diabetes Ahvaz cohort study (LAGAs) were investigated for risk factors of gestational diabetes mellitus.
Result
The prevalence of overweight and obesity were 40% and25.8% in the GMD group and in 35.8% and 16.2% in the control group respectively (p = 0.002). According to NCEP-ATP III criteria, 16.9% of women with GDM and 6.9% of mothers in the control group had metabolic syndrome in first visit of pregnancy (p < 0.001. Logistic regression showed that there is a significant relationship between maternal age[OR = 1.05(95% CI, 1.01–1.10)] (p = 0.01), previous GDM [OR = 5.60(95% CI, 2.21–14.18)] (p = 0.001), positive family history of diabetes[OR = 1.86(95% CI, 1.19–2.94)] (p = 0.006), pre-pregnancy BMI [OR = 1.05(95% CI, 1.007–1.11)] (p = 0.04) and metabolic syndrome in first visit of pregnancy[OR = 2.34 (95% CI, 1.038–5.30)] (p = 0.04) with GDM.
Conclusion

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Apolipoproteins are emerging as powerful predictors of CVD. We aimed to study associations of metabolic syndrome and apoB, apoAI, apoB/AI ratio in young Sri Lankans with type 2 diabetes.
Materials & methods
Blood samples were available from 690 patients with type 2 diabetes in Sri Lanka Young Diabetes Study, and were analysed for apoB, apoAI, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), triglycerides (TG) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). Their associations with MetS as perNCEP/ATPIII criteria were studied.
Results
MetS was present in 60.9% of subjects. Of those with MetS, 76.0% were women. Those with MetS had higher apoB (1.27 V s 1.19 mmol/L; p = 0.001), apoB/AI (0.80 V s 0.75; p = 0.001), non-HDL cholesterol (NHDLC) (4.15 V s 3.98 mmol/L; p = 0.002),and triglycerides (1.51 V s 1.31 mmol/L; p < 0.001) and lower apoAI (1.58 V s 1.60 mmol/L; p = 0.03) and HDLC (1.02 V s 1.16 mmol/L, p < 0.001). ApoB and apoB/AIlevels increased significantly as the number of MetS components increased. ApoB and apoB:AI ratio were independently associated with MetS and components.
Conclusion
MetS showed a high prevalence among young Sri Lankans with diabetes. Elevated apoB is commonly clustered with other risk indicators in MetS."

To compare the clinical and glycemic profile as well as pregnancy complications and infant mortality among diabetic mothers in Indonesia.
Materials and Methods
Data was obtained from medical records of Internal-Medicine Clinic in Hermina Podomoro General Hospital during the period January-December 2015. Subjects were grouped into good and poor outcome groups based on infant mortality.
Results
Forty-five subjects were obtained with an average age of 31 years, 41 had gestational diabetes mellitus while 4 had pregestational diabetes. Twenty-one patients had high-risk pregnancies (age >30 years or <20 years). No maternal mortalities were reported, only 6 pregnancies were complicated with infant death. Comorbidities mainly found were preeclampsia, anemia and urinary tract infection. Most patients delivered through caesarian section. Almost all of them were treated with insulin. Comparison between both groups showed that those with poor outcomes have a significantly higher body mass index prior to pregnancy, higher body weight prior and after pregnancy as well as worse glycemic profile.
Conclusion
Diabetes in pregnancy has been found to increase rates of infant mortality. This study showed that patients with poor glycemic control are at a greater risk of infant mortality. Therefore increased monitoring and prenatal care as well as optimal glycemic control for patients with diabetes in pregnancy is recommended. Optimal glycemic control will lead to diabetic mothers with pregnancies of equal risk and similar outcomes to those of normal patients."

Metabolic syndrome (MS) is considered one of the major worldwide epidemics. It accounts for billions of cardiovascular disease events and deaths. Till now, major basics of MS are not fully clarified. Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor-α (PPARα) displays a ligand-activated transcription factor. It is involved in the regulation of many metabolic processes including inflammation, lipid, and glucose metabolism. Therefore, this study investigated the leucocytic expression of PPARα in a metabolic patient in comparison to healthy controls.
Methods
100 subjects with MS were recruited, in addition to 100 subjects without any obvious metabolic disorders as healthy controls. Expression of PPARα and CD 36 were analyzed on different leucocytic populations using optimized flow-cytometric analysis. Correlations of the expression of both indexes with different clinical and laboratory parameters were analyzed.
Results
The eosinophilic expression of PPARα was found to be lower in subjects with MS in comparison to the healthy controls (p value 0.001). Also, PPARα expression, on most of the leucocytic populations, was inversely correlated with waist circumferences among the study populations.
Conclusion
Circulated eosinophilic expression of PPARα protein is reduced in MS subjects. This conclusion may explain the endothelial dysfunction and obesity associated with MS, as well as it may help in the management of this worldwide health problem."

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) is a new adipokine increased in central obesity and related to insulin resistance (IR). Postmenopausal (PM) state may be associated with increase in body weight and central fat distribution. We hypothesize that DPP4 is increased in PM women.
Materials and methods
Twenty-two non-obese PM and 22 non-obese premenopausal women (PreM), were evaluated. DPP4 activity, lipid profile, HbA1c, FSH, estradiol and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were measured; an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed and IR calculated. Body composition was assessed by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Correlations between DPP4 and the anthropometric and metabolic variables and body fat distribution were studied.
Results
DPP4 activity was not different between the two groups (PM 5309 ± 650 vs PreM 5387 ± 704 RLU; p = 0,70). In the PM group there was a significant correlation between DPP4 and body weight (r = 0,498; p = 0,03; n = 22) and trunk fat (r = 0,477; p = 0,03; n = 21).

Anthropometric data were collected based on standard guild line for anthropometric measurement. Five milliliter of venous blood was collected from ante-cubital fossa after overnight fasting for 8 h. Semi-automated clinical chemistry analyzer (Temis Linear) was used for biochemical laboratory analysis. Data analysis was performed by using SPSS version-20 software. Binary and multiple logistic regressions were used to identify the association between dependent and independent variables. P value less than 0.05 was taken as statistically significant association.
Results
The prevalence of metabolic syndrome among psychiatric patients was 28.9%. Age greater than 30 years old (AOR: 5.2, CI: 2.3, 11.8, P. value < 0.05); being female (AOR: 7.1, CI: 3.3, 15.2, P. value < 0.05); regularly eating high protein and fat (AOR: 3.3, CI: 1.3, 8.2, P. value < 0.056) were independent determinant variables for high prevalence of metabolic syndrome among diabetic patients in the study area. The other independent variables such as family history of hypertension, chewing chat, Psychotropic drugs, duration of treatment, regularly eating fruits and vegetables had no statistically significant association with metabolic syndrome (P. value > 0.05).
Conclusion and recommendation
There was high prevalence of metabolic syndrome among the psychiatric patients. Therefore; close assessment, management and treatment of metabolic syndrome among patients with psychiatry problem is essential."

The aim of this paper is to provide population-based data from California on: (a) the prevalence and the odds of diabetes among non-obese South Asian (SA) Americans compared to non-Hispanic Whites (NHW); (b) to assess the prevalence and odds of optimal medical care including regular eye exams, foot exams, and the monitoring of hemoglobin A1C blood glucose levels; and (c) To identify the factors that are associated with diabetes among SA Americans.
Methods
The combined 2007, 2009, and 2011 waves of the adult California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) was used to analyze a non-obese (BMI<30) sample of 1251 SA and 72,072 NHW. Chi-square and logistic regression analyses were performed using Stata.
Results
Non-obese SA had more than twice the odds of diabetes in comparison to NHW (OR = 2.50; 1.66, 3.76), even after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. Despite their higher propensity for diabetes, there were no significant ethnic differences in the level of optimal care received by those with diabetes. Among non-obese South Asian Americans, the odds of diabetes were higher for older respondents, those without a post-secondary degree, those who were foreign-born, those who had ever smoked, and those with BMI from 25 to 29.99.
Conclusions
Non-obese SA in California experience a disproportionately higher prevalence of diabetes than their NHW counterparts."

Obesity represents one of the common medical disorders that carries a high risk of morbidity and mortality. Insertion of intragastric balloon is one of the recently introduced lines of treatment of obesity. It allows patients to sense abdominal fullness and reduce their food intake. However, gastric ulceration may be a serious adverse effect that may be associated with intragastric balloon insertion.
Aim
To assess the role of silent helicobacter pylori infection in intragastric balloon-induced ulcers and to explore the possible methods for amelioration of this effect.
Methods
Thirty patients were divided into 2 equal groups; one of them received triple therapy for helicobacter pylori eradication and the other group received placebo treatment. Then, they underwent intragastric balloon insertion. After removal of the balloon, gastroscopy was performed to evaluate the gastric mucosal lesions, if present.
Results
There was significant decrease in the incidence of gastric erosions and ulcerations in the group that received triple therapy for helicobacter pylori eradication compared to the group that received placebo treatment.
Conclusion
Eradication of silent helicobacter pylori infection may represent a promising hope to decrease the incidence and improve symptoms of gastric erosions and ulceration that may be associated with intragastric balloon insertion."

Rhabdomyolysis is considered by some studies as a rare complication of a common disorder of diabetic ketoacidosis, while others consider it as not so uncommon. The mechanism is still not clear but can be attributed to a number of factors like acidosis, hyperglycemia and electrolyte disturbances especially hypophosphatemia and hypokalaemia. Missing it may lead to more serious complications and may prolong and/or complicate full recovery of diabetic ketoacidosis.
Aim
The aim of this study was to measure the incidence of rhabdomyolysis among patients presented with diabetic ketoacidosis in the emergency department of Baghdad Teaching hospital, its relation to the severity of diabetic ketoacidosis and the associated electrolytes disturbances.
Patients and methods
This is a cross sectional study carried out in the emergency department of Baghdad teaching hospital/Iraq; where 43 patients with type1 diabetes presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis were included. Diabetic ketoacidosis was classified into mild, moderate and severe, and the incidence of rhabdomyolysis was calculated accordingly. Full blood investigations, urinary ketones and arterial blood gasses were done.
Results
Rhabdomyolysis was found in 3 (6.98%) patients with more severe acidosis and urinary ketones in the setting of moderate and severe diabetic ketoacidosis. Statistically significant finding was observed with the duration of diabetes, higher serum creatinine, higher serum potassium, higher serum chloride, severe acidosis and urinary ketones.
Conclusions
Rhabdomyolysis incidence in this study was 6.98% of patients with more severe acidosis, urinary ketones in the setting of moderate to severe diabetic ketoacidosis and with longer duration of diabetes."

Probiotics have beneficial effect on obesity related disorders in animal models. Despite a large number of animal data, randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCT) concluded that probiotics have a moderate effect on glycemic control-related parameters. However, effect of probiotics on insulin resistance are inconsistent.
Aim
In a double-blind single center RCT, effect of alive multistrain probiotic vs. placebo on insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes patient were assessed.
Methods
A total of 53 patients met the criteria for inclusion. They were randomly assigned to receive multiprobiotic “Symbiter” (concentrated biomass of 14 probiotic bacteria genera Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Propionibacterium) or placebo for 8-weeks administered as a sachet formulation. The primary main outcome was the change HOMA-IR (homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance) which calculated using Matthews et al.’s equation. Secondary outcomes were the changes in glycemic control-related parameters, anthropomorphic variables and cytokines.
Results
Supplementation with alive multiprobiotic for 8 weeks was associated with significant reduction of HOMA-IR from 6.85 ± 0.76 to 5.13 ± 0.49 (p = 0.047), but remained static in the placebo group. With respect to our secondary outcomes, HbA1c insignificant decreased by 0.09% (p = 0.383) and 0.24% (p = 0.068) respectively in placebo and probiotics groups. However, in probiotic responders (n = 22, patient with decrease in HOMA-IR) after supplementation a significant reduction in HbA1c by 0.39% (p = 0.022) as compared to non-responders was observed. In addition, from markers of chronic systemic inflammatory state only TNF-α and IL-1β changes significantly after treatment with probiotics.
Conclusion
Probiotic therapies modestly improved insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes."

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major health burden worldwide with many patients encountering thyroid dysfunction later in their life. Various studies have found that diabetes and thyroid disorders mutually influence each other and both disorders tend to coexists. However, the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction and associated clinical variables in these patients has not been investigated.
Objectives
The study aimed at determining the incidence and prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in patients with T2DM in relation to age, sex, metabolic syndrome and other co-morbid conditions.
Research designs & methods
In this cross-sectional study, 250 Type 2 DM patients were enrolled aged between 40 and 75 years. All the patients were evaluated for thyroid dysfunction by testing thyroid profile (T3, T4 and TSH. These subjects were also investigated for fasting blood sugar (FBS), post prandial glucose (PPG) glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), serum cholesterol, serum triglycerides, high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein(LDL), very low density lipoprotein(VLDL), blood urea, serum creatinine and presence of other co-morbid conditions. The observations and interpretations were recorded and results obtained were statistically analyzed.
Results
A high prevalence of thyroid dysfunction (28%) was observed in type 2 diabetic patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (18.8%) as the commonest thyroid disorder. Thyroid dysfunction was more prevalent in females, with presence of dyslipidemia, retinopathy, poor glycemic state (HbA1c ≥7) and longer duration of diabetes as significant contributing factors associated.
Conclusions
In addition to glycemic status, screening of thyroid disorder should be routinely done in type 2 diabetic subjects along with other comorbid conditions."

Materials and Methods
Insulin sensitivity for 44 NGT, normotensive subjects, age 18–26 yrs., was determined by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) and from Matsuda index (ISI Matsuda).
Results
Subjects were normoglycemic fasted (4.59 + 0.35 mmol/L) and at two hours post OGTT (4.52  + 1.35 mmol/L). Besides anthropometric measures, there were significant differences between OW/O and L for fasting insulin (P < 0.001) and both measures of insulin sensitivity (P < 0.05). All subjects exhibited a 9-fold range in HOMA-IR (0.88 + 0.51, range 0.3–2.7) and an 8-fold range in ISI Matsuda (11.9 + 4.7, range 3.0–24.2). The latter was inversely correlated with systolic blood pressure (r = 0.35, P = 0.04) even though subjects were normotensive.

Foot disease is a common complication of type 2 diabetes that can have tragic consequences. Abnormal plantar pressures are considered to play a major role in the pathologies of neuropathic ulcers in the diabetic foot.
Aim
To examine Relationship of Planter Pressure and Glycemic Control in Type 2 Diabetic Patients with and without Neuropathy.
Materials and methods
The study was conducted on 50 type 2 diabetic patients and 30 healthy volunteers. BMI calculation, disease duration, Hemoglobin A1c and presence of neuropathy (by history, foot examination and DN4 questionnaire) were recorded. Plantar pressure was recorded for all patients using the Mat-scan (Tekscan, Inc.vers. 6.34 Boston USA) in static conditions (standing) and dynamic conditions (taking a step on the Mat-scan). Plantar pressures (kPa) were determined at the five metatarsal areas, mid foot area, medial and lateral heel areas and medial three toes.
Results
Static and dynamic plantar pressures in both right and left feet were significantly higher in diabetic with neuropathy group than in control group in measured areas (P<0.05). Static and dynamic pressures in right and left feet were significantly higher in diabetic with neuropathy group than in diabetic without neuropathy group in measured areas (P<0.05). On comparison between controls and diabetic without neuropathy group there was a significant difference in plantar pressures especially in metatarsal areas (P<0.05). No significant correlations were present between the studied variables age, disease duration, BMI and HbA1c and plantar pressures in all studied areas.
Conclusion
Persons with diabetic neuropathy have elevated peak plantar pressure (PPP) compared to patients without neuropathy and control group. HbA1c% as a surrogate for glycemic control had no direct impact on peak planter pressure, yet it indirectly impacts neuropathy evolution through out disease duration eventually leading to the drastic planter pressure and gait biomechanics changes."

abstract = "Aims
Diabetic foot is one of the most serious and costly complications of diabetes. Empowerment is an important indicator in promoting foot care behaviors that helps patients to use their maximum abilities. This study was carried out with the aim of empowering patients with type 2 diabetes to prevent diabetic foot in the city of Fuladshahr, Isfahan, Iran.
Methods
This is a quasi-experimental study. 104 eligible patients were randomly assigned to two groups: intervention group and control group. The data were collected through a form of profile, empowerment questionnaire, and foot care behavior checklist. The questionnaires were completed by the two groups in the pre-intervention, 1 and 3 months after the end of the intervention. Data were analyzed in SPSS22 using independent t-test, paired t-test, Chi-square, ANOVA, LSD post hoc test and repeated data analysis.
Results
The results showed that there was no significant difference between two groups in terms of demographic variables. Independent t-test showed that there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of mean score of empowerment and foot care behavior before intervention. However, the mean score of empowerment and foot care behavior of the experiment group was significantly higher than that of the control group in 1 and 3 months after the intervention (P < 0.001).
Conclusion
The empowerment of diabetic patients is effective in promoting foot care behavior, and implementation of empowerment programs in diabetes clinics in this city is recommended."

Clinical trials administering exercise training for at least 4 weeks and examining either heart rate variability (HRV), baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), heart rate recovery (HRR) as outcome measures were eligible. Eighteen articles were found to be relevant and were then assessed for characteristics and quality. Fifteen studies out of 18 found that exercise training leads to positive improvements in autonomic function of T2DM patients. Exercise participation enhances cardiac autonomic function of type 2 diabetics and therefore should be implemented in their management programs."

Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the major chronic vascular complication of T2DM and leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Inflammation is one of the proposed pathway which explains microvascular complications in T2DM but exact mechanism is still unclear. Omentin-1 is an anti-inﬂammatory adipokine which promotes insulin signaling. IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine having role in immune and inflammatory responses. The present study was conducted to elucidate the role of omentin-1 and IL-6 in the pathogenesis of DN and its association with insulin resistance. We aimed to assess and compare the serum levels of omentin-1 and IL-6 in T2DM patients with and without DN.
Materials & Methods
Our study comprised of 2 groups of 41 each. Group A (controls) included T2DM without nephropathy patients and group B (cases) included T2DM nephropathy patients. Parameters studied were serum omentin-1, insulin, IL-6, fasting blood glucose, urea, creatinine, lipid profile, HOMA-IR, eGFR and BMI.
Results & Conclusion
Omentin-1 (p=0.03) was significantly decreased; concomitantly, significant increase in levels of insulin (p=0.004), IL-6 (p=0.023) and HOMA-IR (p=0.0004) were found in cases compared to controls. Bivariate analysis showed eGFR correlating positively with omentin-1 and negatively with insulin in the study population. Our study results, based on serum omentin-1 and IL-6 data suggest important role played by inflammatory mechanism and insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients."

To evaluate the serum paraoxonase 1 activity and determine its association with duration in type 2 Diabetes mellitus patients.
Methods
A total of 80 cases from type 2 diabetes mellitus and healthy controls were enrolled in the present case control study. Human serum PON1 concentration was measured by ELISA and western blotting and it activity was determined spectrophotometrically using 4-nitrophenyle acetate. Diagnostic accuracy of serum PON1 to identify type 2 Diabetes mellitus was calculated with ROC analysis.
Result
Serum concentration of LDL, VLDL, TG, A1C, FBS and TC levels showed significantly higher levels in type 2 diabetes patients as compared to healthy controls, however there were no significant differences found in the level of HDL. Serum PON1 concentration and activity monitored in patients with >1 year diabetes showed higher level (75.1 ± 6.8 ng/mL) as compared to patients with >3 years diabetes (65.24 ± 1.6 ng/mL), its level was further decreased in patients with >5 (53.8 ± 2.6 ng/mL) and >7 years (48.1 ± 2.7 ng/mL) of diabetes. PON1 concentration decreased as the duration of diabetes increased. PON1 level was further decreased due to habits like smoking and alcohol consumption.
Conclusion
Serum PON1 levels decrease in states of high oxidative stress like metabolic syndrome, obesity, uncontrolled diabetes, and dyslipidemia. It can be used as diagnostic marker for diabetes mellitus along with increased TG, LDL, VLDL and FBG."

Strict glycemic control reduces the development and progression of diabetes-related complications, and there is evidence that improved metabolic control improves outcomes in subjects having diabetes mellitus with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). Glycemic control in people with kidney disease is complex. Changes in glucose and insulin homoeostasis may occur as a consequence of loss of kidney function and dialysis. The reliability of measures of long-term glycemic control is affected by CKD and the accuracy of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the setting of CKD and ESKD is questioned. Despite the altered character of diabetes in CKD, current guidelines for diabetes management are not specifically adjusted for this patient group. The validity of indicators of long-term glycemic control has been the focus of increased recent research.

abstract = "Aim
Insulin and uric acid were shown affect the prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome (MetS), but no studies examine their interaction. Therefore, we conducted this study to determine their biological interaction in subjects from central Mexico.
Methods
433 subjects were enrolled for a cross-sectional study. MetS was defined according to the Harmonizing Definition. Hyperuricemia was defined as ≥7.0 mg/dL in males and ≥5.8 mg/dL in females. Hyperinsulinemia was defined as ≥11.0 μU/mL. Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was calculated to determine the association between uric acid or insulin and MetS. Logistic regression was used to determine the risk (odds ratio) of developing MetS. Biological interactions were determined by the PROCESS Macro and Anderson’s method.
Results
Insulin and uric acid levels were elevated in MetS positive group (p < .05) and correlated with the number of MetS components (r = 0.276 and r = 0.166, p < .001, respectively). The interaction between uric acid and insulin was associated with the number of MetS components (PROCESS Model 1, interaction coefficient = −0.009, 95%CI: −0.017 to −0.001, p = .036). Johnson-Neyman analysis suggests the interaction is lost when uric acid concentration increased >7.0 mg/dL. When the cohort was separated by hyperinsulinemia and hyperuricemia, there was a significant risk of developing MetS for subjects with hyperuricemia (odds ratio = 2.3; 95%CI: 1.1–4.8, p < .05), hyperinsulinemia (odds ratio = 3.1; 95%CI: 1.9–4.9, p < .05), or both (odds ratio = 7.4; 95%CI: 3.2–17.2, p < .05); however, there was no multiplicative or additive interaction.
Conclusion
Here, we show that uric acid and insulin augments the prevalence of MetS; however, no biological interaction was determined for hyperuricemia and hyperinsulinemia."

This study aimed to introduce and apply modern statistical techniques for assessing association and predictive value of risk factors in first-degree relatives (FDR) of patients with diabetes from repeatedly measured diabetes data.
Methods
We used data from 1319 FDR’s of patients with diabetes followed for 8 years. Association and predictive performance of weight (Wt), body mass index (BMI), waist and hip circumferences (WC and HC) and their ratio (WHR), waist-height ratio (WHtR) and a body shape index (ABSI) in relation to future diabetes were evaluated by using Cox regression and joint longitudinal-survival modeling.
Results
According to Cox regression, in total sample, WC, HC, Wt, WHtR and BMI had significant direct association with diabetes (all p < 0.01) with the best predictive ability for WHtR (concordance probability estimate = 0.575). Joint modeling suggested direct associations between diabetes and WC, WHR, Wt, WHtR and BMI in total sample (all p < 0.05). According to LPML criterion, WHtR was the best predictor in both total sample and females with LPML of −2666.27 and −2185.67, respectively. However, according to AUC criteria, BMI had the best predictive performance with AUC-JM = 0.7629 and dAUC-JM = 0.5883 in total sample. In females, both AUC criteria indicated that WC was the best predictor followed by WHtR.
Conclusion
WC, WHR, Wt, WHtR and BMI are among candidate anthropometric measures to be monitored in diabetes prevention programs. Larger multi-ethnic and multivariate research are warranted to assess interactions and identify the best predictors in subgroups."

Patients and methods
A cohort of 106 patients with DM2, 42–83 years of age, and eGFR < 60 ml/min/m2 were included. Age, sex, duration of diabetes, duration of attending our clinic, smoking habits, BMI, data regarding ischemic heart disease and induction of hemodialysis, urine albumin excretion (UAE) levels, eGFR (MDRD equation) and values of various biochemical parameters were recorded too. Follow-up period ranged from one to 25 years. Paired samples t-test and non-parametrical Kruskal–Wallis test were used for the analyses of the data.
Results
Fifty percent of patients had no further progression, 25.9% improvement, while 24.1% had worsening of the UAE levels. During the follow-up in the joined clinic, there was a smaller than the expected from the medical literature decrease in median eGFR, i.e. 2,3 ml/min/m2 and a statistically significant improvement in glycosylated hemoglobin levels from 8.0% to 7.4% (p = 0.016). Time in years of follow-up in the joined clinic of our hospital appeared to be the most significant factor in the improvement or stabilization against deterioration of the UAE levels (p = 0.018).
Conclusions
Close follow-up of DM2 patients with eGFR < 60 ml/min/m2 has resulted in a minor annual eGFR decrease. Monitoring of these patients in a specialized diabetic nephropathy clinic is beneficial for this group of patients for delaying the occurrence of end-stage renal disease."

The first cardiovascular risk prediction model in the Arab world was recently developed for Omanis with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study aims to validate the newly developed model.
Materials and methods
A retrospective cohort study design was applied in this study. The model was validated in two samples; the model derivation sample and a separate validation sample, consisting of 1314 and 405 diabetics respectively. All patients were free of cardiovascular disease at the baseline (2009–2010) and were followed up until: the first cardiovascular event occurred; the patient died; or up to December 2015. All data were retrieved from the patients’ medical records in a primary care setting.
Results
In both the derivation and validation samples, the model showed good discrimination, with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.73 (95% CI; 0.69–0.77) and 0.70 (95% CI: 0.59–0.75) respectively. Calibration of the model was satisfactory and the actual difference between the mean predicted and observed risk in different risk groups ranged from 0.7%–3.1% and 0.1%–4.2% in the derivation and validation samples respectively.
Conclusion
The recently developed cardiovascular disease risk assessment model for Omanis with type 2 diabetes achieved adequate overall validity. The model showed good discrimination and acceptable calibration; it therefore has the potential to be used in local clinical settings. However, further validation and comparison studies are needed to judge the generalizability and superiority of the model over other tools currently used in Oman."

Aims
To measure the level of leptin in volunteers and correlate it with several anthropometric, biochemical variables and abdominal fat volumes.
Methods
The level of leptin was investigated in 167 disease-free volunteers. Serum levels of IL-6, adiponectin, and resistin, blood lipid profile (cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglyceride (TG) were determined. Waist circumference (WC) was measured using tape and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images.
Results
All measured anthropometric (BMI, WC measured by tape and MRI) and biochemical variables (adiponectin, resistin, cholesterol, HDL, LDL and TG); and abdominal fats showed a significant (p<0.05) difference between participants with abnormal serum leptin levels and those with normal leptin levels. A higher percentage of participants with abnormal serum leptin were obese males while participants with normal leptin levels were either overweight or normal weight females. A significant (p <0.05) positive correlation was detected between serum leptin concentration and WC, BMI, subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, total abdominal fat, and resistin. A moderate association was found between serum leptin concentration and the inflammatory cytokine IL-6.
Conclusion
Abnormal serum leptin, was detected in obese male individuals which may be considered as an important indicator for the development of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes."

Vitamin D supplementation in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients may lead to improved glycemic control by improving insulin secretion and decreasing insulin resistance.
Aims
To investigate effect of oral vitamin D supplementation on glycemic control, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and coexisting hypovitaminosis D.
Settings and design
Randomized, Parallel Group, Placebo Controlled Trial carried out in a tertiary care hospital of Indian Armed Forces.
Methods and material
Sixty patients with coexisting type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypovitaminosis D were randomized into cases and controls and were supplemented with oral Vitamin D and microcrystalline cellulose respectively for six months. Subjects' HbA1c and vitamin D levels were monitored at the beginning and end of the study, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) & post prandial plasma glucose (PPPG) during monthly OPD visits.
Statistical analysis used
Intra-group comparison was made by paired t test & unpaired t test was used for inter-group (A v/s B) comparisons. Repeated measures ANOVA was undertaken to compare values over time.
Results
The two groups were comparable for all parameters at baseline. Case group showed significant decrease in mean HbA1c levels (7.29% to 7.02%; P = 0.01), mean FPG levels (131.4 to 102.6 mg/dl; P = 0.04) and mean PPPG levels (196.2 to 135.0 mg/dl; P < 0.001). Incidentally, significant improvement in systolic as well as diastolic blood pressure and total cholesterol was also noted in the cases, while for LDL cholesterol improvement tended towards significance (p = 0.05).
Conclusions
We found that oral vitamin D supplementation was associated with improved glycemic control and other metabolic parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Supplementation to achieve normal levels of vitamin D can be a promising adjuvant therapy for T2DM patients & coexisting hypovitaminosis D."

Large-scale clinical trials and translational studies have demonstrated that weight loss achieved through diet and physical activity reduced the development of diabetes in overweight individuals with prediabetes. These interventions also reduced the occurrence of metabolic syndrome and risk factors linked to other chronic conditions including obesity-driven cancers and cardiovascular disease. The Healthy Living Partnerships to Prevent Diabetes (HELP PD) was a clinical trial in which participants were randomized to receive a community-based lifestyle intervention translated from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) or an enhanced usual care condition. The objective of this study is to compare the 12 and 24 month prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the two treatment arms of HELP PD.
Materials and methods
The intervention involved a group-based, behavioral weight-loss program led by community health workers monitored by personnel from a local diabetes education program. The enhanced usual care condition included dietary counseling and written materials.
Results
HELP PD included 301 overweight or obese participants (BMI 25–39.9kg/m2) with elevated fasting glucose levels (95–125mg/dl). At 12 and 24 months of follow-up there were significant improvements in individual components of the metabolic syndrome: fasting blood glucose, waist circumference, HDL, triglycerides and blood pressure and the occurrence of the metabolic syndrome in the intervention group compared to the usual care group.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that a community diabetes prevention program in participants with prediabetes results in metabolic benefits and a reduction in the occurrence of the metabolic syndrome in the intervention group compared to the enhanced usual care group."

Research in the last decade tried to focus on natural and unnatural causes of death in schizophrenic patients, but recent few years has focussed on emerging cardio-metabolic risk factors, as a cause of mortality in such patients.
Aim of the study
To assess the determinant of metabolic syndrome in drug naïve schizophrenic patients.
Methodology
It was a cross sectional study; 30 indoor patients with diagnosis of schizophrenia were included. Height, weight, waist circumference and Blood pressure assessment was done by using standard protocol. Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG), Triglyceride (TGs), High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) total cholesterol were measured. International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria was considered for establishing metabolic syndrome. Statistical analysis was done by using chi square and ANOVA.
Results
Majority of the patients were females; hailing from rural area; unskilled professional; educated up to below primary level; were single and Hindu by religion. Most common metabolic abnormality was low HDL in 76.6%; High TGs in 26.6%; High SBP ≥130mm Hg in 16.67%; DBP>85mm Hg in 13.33%; High FBS 10% of the patients. In risk assessment strongest risk factors for metabolic syndrome were high waist circumference, FBS and TGs. BMI, total cholesterol, LDL and VLDL were also observed as a risk factors in drug naïve schizophrenic patients.
Conclusion
HDL, FBS, TGs, waist circumference and BMI are all the strong risk factors for development of metabolic syndrome in drug naïve schizophrenia patients."

Subclinical hypothyroidism known as mild thyroid disorder without significant sign and symptoms. The correlation between subclinical hypothyroidism and some of cardiovascular disease risk factors such as serum lipids, homocysteine levels and also insulin resistance index is not well established and the current study was conducted to clarify this issue.
Methods and materials
Seventy four patients with mild elevation in levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) along with normal levels of T3 and T4 were selected as patients group and 74 age and sex matched individuals were selected as healthy control group. Serum insulin, triglyceride, glucose, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and homocysteine levels were measured. Obtained data compared between groups with independent sample t-test. For evaluation of the correlation between mentioned parameters Pearson correlation coefficient method was used.
Results
Serum levels of LDL-C and total cholesterol significantly increased in SCH group compared to healthy control group. Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOM-IR) and serum homocysteine level significantly elevated in patients with SCH compared to control group. There was a significant direct correlation between HOM-IR and serum homocysteine levels in SCH patients.
Conclusion
Subclinical hypothyroidism likely have significant effect on insulin resistance as major diabetes risk factors and also cardiovascular disease risk factors such as homocysteine. The direct correlation between HOM-IR with serum homocysteine level indicate the possible role of insulin resistance in elevation of serum homocysteine in SCH patient group."

The data about the incidence of diabetes is scarce from developing countries. We studied the incidence of type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 DM (T2DM) in a cohort of young military personnel followed for a long duration.
Methods
The data for this descriptive epidemiologic study was derived from the electronic medical records (EMR) of the male service personnel enrolled between 1990 and 2015. All subjects were recruited before 18 years of age in good health and the onset of DM was derived from the EMR. We calculated the incidence rates as per person years using appropriate statistical methods.
Results
Our study population includes 51,217 participants (median age 33 years, range 17–54) with a mean follow up of 12.5 years, giving a cumulative follow up duration of 613,925 person-years (py). A total of 251 patients developed T2DM and 15 patients developed T1DM during the study period. The incidence rate of T2DM was 0.41 per 1000 py and that of T1DM was 2.44 per 100,000 py.
Conclusion
Our cohort had low incidence rates of diabetes when compared with other studies from India and abroad. Active military service with good life style measures may offer protection from the DM."

The liver plays an important role in glucose homeostasis, and various chronic liver diseases have a negative effect on glucose metabolism with the consequent emergence of diabetes. Some aspects related to chronic liver disease can affect diagnostic tools and the monitoring of diabetes and other glucose metabolism disorders, and clinicians must be aware of these limitations in their daily practice. In cirrhotic patients, fasting glucose may be normal in up until 23% of diabetes cases, and glycated hemoglobin provides falsely low results, especially in advanced cirrhosis. Similarly, the performance of alternative glucose monitoring tests, such as fructosamine, glycated albumin and 1,5-anhydroglucitol, also appears to be suboptimal in chronic liver disease. This review will examine the association between changes in glucose metabolism and various liver diseases as well as the particularities associated with the diagnosis and monitoring of diabetes in liver disease patients.

Quantitative studies were included since they presented one well-defined parameter to evaluate DM and specifically measured social capital. We used the PRISMA and STROBE guidelines to perform this review and to evaluate the quality of papers. Only three papers met the inclusion criteria. All studies adopted cross-sectional design. The population, the instruments used to measure social capital, and the statistical analysis were different among the papers. In conclusion, although social capital seems to be related to DM, more studies are necessary to understand which dimensions are more important in this association, if the association is the same at the individual or neighborhood level, and what kind of population in terms of education, poverty and culture would be more influenced by social capital in DM control."

Nephropathy is a major complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and is heralded by the insidious development of microalbuminuria (MA). It is suggested that the serum levels of Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is correlated with diabetic nephropathy. In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated serum ICAM-1 level in diabetic patients with and without MA.
Methods
A total of 187 participants were enrolled and were classified into three groups including 40 healthy controls and 2 diabetic groups with (n = 59) or without MA (n = 88). Serum levels of ICAM-1, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein cholesterol and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured in all three groups. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Serum levels of ICAM-1 were significantly higher in diabetic patients irrespective of MA. Moreover, ICAM-1 levels in patients with MA were significantly higher than patients without MA. Patients with MA had significantly higher age and blood pressure compared to those without MA (P = 0.001). Serum levels of ICAM-1 were significantly correlated with age and HbA1c.
Conclusions
Overall, serum ICAM-1 levels were significantly higher in T2DM patients with MA and it may be associated with the severity of diabetic kidney disease."

This study aimed to determine the prevalence rate of metabolic syndrome and its potential risk factors, 6–12 weeks postpartum in women with GDM compared to women with normal glucose tolerance.
Methods
LAGAs is an ongoing population-based prospective cohort study that started in March 2015 in Ahvaz, Iran. During 11 months of study progression, 176 women with GDM pregnancy and 86 healthy women underwent a fasting glucose test, 75-g OGTT and fasting lipid tests at 6–12 weeks postpartum. GDM was defined based on IADPSG criteria. Postpartum glucose intolerance was defined according to ADA criteria and metabolic syndrome using 2 sets of criteria.
Results
The overall rate of metabolic syndrome at 6–12 weeks postpartum was 16% by NCEP-ATP III criteria (18.2% in women with GDM and 11.6% in controls) and 19.1% by IDF criteria (21% in women with gestational diabetes and 15.1% in controls). Pre-pregnancy overweight or obesity, (OR 1.89, 95% CI: 1.05-3.38, P = .03), pregnancy systolic blood pressure (OR 1.03, 95% CI: 1.008–1.52, P = .006) and requiring insulin or metformin (OR 3.08, 95% CI: 1.25–7.60, P = 0.01), were associated risk factors for the presence of MetS in GDM-exposed women. In women with normal glucose during pregnancy, pre-pregnancy BMI ≥25 kg/m2 was a risk factor of metabolic syndrome (OR 2.82, 95% CI: 1.11–7.15, P = .02).
Conclusion
The rate of metabolic syndrome in women with or without GDM at 6–12 weeks postpartum is high particularly in women with high BMI. An early postpartum prevention and screening program for cardiovascular risk factors is important for women with GDM."

Diabetes is a growing public health problem in India which is soon going to become the ‘diabetes capital’ of the world. It requires regular care and follow up. We aimed to estimate the household out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure and catastrophic expenditure due to hospitalization and outpatient care as a result of diabetes.
Materials and methods
Secondary analysis of nationally representative data for India collected by National Sample Survey Organization in 2014, reporting on health service utilization and health care related OOP expenditure by income quintiles and by type of health facility (public or private).
Results
The median household OOP expenditure from hospitalization due to diabetes was USD 151, and was 3 times higher among the richest quintile compared to the poorest quintile (p<0.001). There was a significantly higher prevalence (p<0.001) of catastrophic expenditure among the poorest quintile (36%) compared to the richest (14%). Median private sector OOP hospitalization expenditure was four times higher than the public sector (p<0.001). Medicines accounted for 41% and 69% of public sector hospitalization and outpatient care respectively. Concentration indices show gross inequity in hospitalization expenditure, prevalence of catastrophic expenditure and utilization of public health facility.
Conclusion
Households with diabetic patients incur a high risk of catastrophic expenditure, particularly for those in the lowest income quintiles and those seeking care in the private sector. Increased availability and access to essential drugs and strengthening of public facilities will significantly reduce OOP expenditure."

abstract = "Aims
To determine the association between the thyroid hormones(FT3, FT4 and TSH) and the lipid profile markers(HDL-c, LDL-c and triglycerides) values in middle-aged women with no metabolic disorders and recurrent chronic symptomatology.
Materials and Methods
We carried out an analytical cross-sectional study in euthyroid women with recurrent chronic symptoms of at least six months with no apparent diagnosis who attended the endocrinological gynaecology outpatient service of a private clinic in Lima-Peru during 2012–2014. Participants who met the eligibility criteria were evaluated according to their thyroid hormones(FT3, FT4 and TSH) and lipid profile markers(HDL-c, LDL-c and triglycerides) values. We elaborated univariate/multivariate linear regression models to evaluate the association between the thyroid markers and the lipid profile levels. The reported association measure was the beta coefficient(β) with its respective p-value.
Results
We analyzed 211 participants, the average age was 44.9 ± 14.0(SD) years, the FT3 and FT4 mean levels were 3.2 ± 0.4 pg/mL and 1.2 ± 0.2 ng/dL respectively, while the TSH median was 2.8(IQR:1.9–4.0) μU/mL. The mean or median levels of LDL-c, HDL-c and triglycerides were of 137.5 ± 37.9 mg/dL, 54.0 ± 15.0 mg/dL and 118.5(IQR:79.5–169.5) mg/dL respectively. In the multivariate linear regression model between the FT3 and LDL-c levels, we found that for each increase in a FT3 unit, the LDL-c values decreased on average 30.85 mg/dL(p < 0.01). We found no statistically significant associations in the other multivariate models of linear regression, among the other thyroid hormones and lipid markers.
Conclusion
We found an inverse association between the FT3 and LDL-c values in women with chronic gynaecological symptoms."

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe muscular disease characterized by progressive loss of functional muscle mass followed by changes in body composition.
Aim
To describe body composition, resting energy expenditure (REE), and metabolic disorders in DMD patients followed-up at a tertiary care center. To analyze the association with type of steroid and ambulatory status, and to compare obese DMD patients with patients with multifactorial obesity.
Population and methods
A prospective, observational, cross-sectional study was conducted. Anthropometric measurements were taken, evaluating body composition with bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), REE with indirect calorimetry, and biochemical parameters in all DMD patients seen between June 2013 and April 2014.
Results
63 boys between 5.4 and 18.7years of age were evaluated. Diagnosis of obesity ranged from 28% measuring body mass indexZ-score (BMIZ-score) to 70% using percentage of fat mass (%FM). Patients who had lost gait had a significantly higher %FM than those in whom gait was preserved (72% vs 46%, p<0.05). Insulin resistance was present in 29% associated with BMI Z-score and waist circumference and 40% had dyslipidemia associated with %FM, both of which were steroid independent. In obese DMD patients REE was lower than predicted and also lower than controls, and persist when dividing the patients into ambulators and non-ambulators.
Conclusions
A high prevalence of obesity was observed. BMI-Z-score underestimates the degree of FM. No correlation was found between steroid type and body composition or metabolic disorders. No differences were found in REE between ambulators and non-ambulators. Obese DMD patients have a lower REE than controls."

Although several studies have assessed the effect of folate supplementation on lipid profiles among patients with metabolic diseases, findings are inconsistent. This review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to summarize the evidence on the effects of folate supplementation on lipid profiles among patients with metabolic diseases.
Methods
Randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) published in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases up to until 20 August 2017 were searched. Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and evaluated risk of bias of included studies. Heterogeneity was measured with a Q-test and with I2 statistics. Data were pooled by using the fix or random-effect model based on the heterogeneity test results and expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI).
Results
A total of thirteen randomized controlled trials were included. Folate supplementation did not affect systolic blood pressure (SMD −0.87; 95% CI, −1.83, 0.09) and diastolic blood pressure (SMD −0.59; 95% CI, −1.55, 0.37), and lipid profiles including triglycerides (SMD 0.10; 95% CI, −0.42, 0.63), total- (SMD 0.06; 95% CI, −0.31, 0.43), HDL- (SMD 0.04; 95% CI, −0.36, 0.44), VLDL- (SMD 0.08; 95% CI, −0.24, 0.41), and LDL-cholesterol (SMD −0.14; 95% CI, −0.55, 0.28).

Overweight and underweight are one of the leading risk factors for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), but little research on this area has been undertaken in Cambodia. Therefore, this study aimed to measure underweight and overweight and their associated risk behaviors among Cambodian high school students.
Methods
3806 students (mean ag = 15.65 years, SD = 1.80, age range = 11–18 years) from the 2013 Cambodia-Global School-based Student Health Survey were used to yield representative samples of the Cambodian students. Body Mass Index (BMI) was assessed by students’ self-reported height and weight. The substance use, depression, eating behaviors, suicidal ideation, and violence were examined as risk factors. The Chi-square and multinomial regressions were performed to assess the relationships between risk factors and BMI.
Results
The prevalence of underweight was 47.4% (N = 1805, Male = 23.3%vs.24.1%) and overweight was 2.3% (N = 89, Male = 1.0%vs.1.3%). The BMI was significantly controlled by age, gender, and body height. Both underweight and overweight students were significantly vulnerable to substance use, feeling depressed, and violent behaviors. Of the risk factors, shortest sleep was prevalent for underweight students while feeling lonely and suicide attempts were the critical risks for overweight students. The daily fruit/vegetable consumption and physical activity were good preventive factors of both underweight and overweight epidemics.
Conclusions
The risk behaviors of students appear to be strongly associated with underweight and overweight. Interventions targeting these risk behaviors may have the potential to reduce risks. Meanwhile, the preventive strategies should focus on vulnerable students who have poor academic performance, mental health issues and a history of violent experiences."

Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the commonest reproductive disorder in women and is closely associated with the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS). The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to describe the risk of MetS in adolescent with PCOS to help diagnosing and preventing of morbidity and mortality later in life.
Methods
Pubmed, Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL and other sources were searched for metabolic syndrome in adolescents with polycystic ovarian syndrome using PRISMA guidelines (Moher et al., 2009). All type of study design of women aged 10–20 reported association of PCOS with metabolic syndrome was included in this study. Meta-analysis was conducted for MetS and its individual component using bias adjusted quality effect model and we compare the results from quality effects with random effects and IVhet model. Data were presented as prevalence, odds ratio (95% confidence interval and mean difference (95% confidence interval).
Results
This systematic review included 9 studies while the meta-analysis included 7 studies. Meta-analysis showed that the odds of being experiencing MetS in PCOS groups was 2.69 (1.29, 5.60) times than girls without PCOS. The mean difference between girls with PCOS and without PCOS for systolic blood pressure was 5.00 (1.28, 8.72), diastolic blood pressure was 3.50 (0.48, 6.56), triglycerides level was 4.20 (−3.99, 12.45), glucose level was 1.30 (−0.46, 3.05), HDL level was −1.40 (−4.85, 2.00).
Conclusion
This systematic review and meta-analysis support the hypothesis that the risk of MetS is much greater in adolescents with PCOS compared to the normal population. It is important to screen PCOS in early age to prevent MetS and its complications which lead to morbidity and mortality later in life."

The present cross-sectional study was conducted using the Yazd health study (YaHS) data which was collected in 2013–14. Statistical population of this study consisted of all 9340 individuals aged between 20 and 69 in Yazd City. Logistic regression was used to determine behavioral factors and family history of diabetes and their interaction in the risk of diabetes.
Results
In the present study, age, family history of type 2 diabetes, waist-to-hip ratio, BMI, educational level, physical activity and smoking were considered as the risk factors for type 2 diabetes.There was a significant interaction(negative interaction) between family history of diabetes and other risk factors only for BMI, so that the risk of developing type-2 diabetes was lower in the presence of two risk factors- family history of diabetes and BMI- than the risk of diabetes in the presence of each of these factors.
Conclusion
Results of the present study suggested that despite the consideration of family history as an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes, if it was used as a tool to raise the awareness and sensitivity in people with type 2 diabetes, it would reduce the risk of developing this type of diabetes in people who had other risk factors for type 2 diabetes."

abstract = "Aims
Recent data showed an alarming rise of new dialysis cases secondary to diabetic nephropathy despite the growing usage of RAAS blockers. Primary objective of this study is to explore the prevalence of RAAS blockers usage among type II diabetic patients, secondary objectives are to compare the prescribing pattern of RAAS blocker between primary and tertiary care center and to explore if the dose of RAAS blocker prescribed was at optimal dose as suggested by trials.
Materials and methods
This is a retrospective study conducted at one public tertiary referral hospital and one public health clinic in Sungai Petani, Kedah, Malaysia.
Results
RAAS blockers in T2DM patients was found to be 65%. In primary care, 14.3% of the RAAS blockers prescribed was ARB. Tertiary care had higher utilization of ARB, which was 42.9%. In primary care setting, the most commonly used ACEI were perindopril (92.4%) followed by enalapril (7.6%), meanwhile perindopril was the only ACEI being prescribed in tertiary care. The most prescribed ARB was irbesartan (63.6%) and telmisartan (54.2%) respectively in primary and tertiary care. Overall, 64.9% of RAAS blockers prescribed by both levels of care were found to be achieving the target dose as recommended in landmark trials. Crude odd ratio of prescribing RAAS blocker in primary care versus tertiary care was reported as 2.70 (95% CI: 1.49 to 4.91).
Conclusion
RAAS blockers usage among T2DM patients was higher in primary care versus tertiary care settings. Majority of the patients did not receive optimal dose of RAAS blockers."

abstract = "Introduction and objective
The role of metformin in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is also increasing. However, almost half of metformin-treated women required additional insulin. Therefore, identifying the characteristics of these women may help define optimal therapeutic strategy.
Methods
This is a retrospective cohort study done in a District General Hospital, UK. GDM was diagnosed by 75 g OGTT test between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation with fasting levels of ≥6.1 mmol/l and/or 2 h postprandial (PP) level of ≥7.8 mmol/l. Logistic regression and receiver operator curves (ROC) were performed to identify the predictors of metformin failure.
Results
Out of 228 women with GDM included, 46/228 (20.2%) and 151/228 (66.2%) received insulin and metformin as first-line medication respectively. Among the metformin-treated, 13 stopped treatment and were excluded from analysis. Of the included 138 metformin-treated women, 77 (55.8%) required supplementary insulin (metformin failure). Metformin failure group had higher maternal age and fasting glucose level at OGTT, HbA1c at OGTT and earlier gestational age (GA) at medication initiation. Metformin failure was predicted if fasting OGTT level >4.8 mmol/l (69% sensitivity and 62% specificity). If the fasting levels of IADPSG (International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups) criteria and NICE (National Institute of Health and Care Excellence) were used, the positive predictive value was 78% and 77% respectively.
Conclusion
As women with higher fasting glucose levels have higher chance of necessitating insulin in later pregnancies, appropriate addition of insulin at metformin initiation for these women could help better glycaemic control throughout pregnancy."

To determine the association between free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4) and free-triiodothyronine-to-free-thyroxine ratio (FT3/FT4) levels and Metabolic Syndrome (MetS).
Materials and methods
We carried out an analytical cross-sectional study in euthyroid adults of both sexes, who attended the outpatient service of a private clinic in Lima-Peru during the 2014–2016 period. Participants were divided into tertiles (low, intermediate and high) according to their FT3, FT4, and FT3/FT4 ratio values. MetS was defined when three or more metabolic criteria were met by the participants. ROC curves were constructed, and Youden’s Index were used to identify the optimal cut-points of each thyroid marker. We elaborated crude/adjusted Poisson regression models to evaluate the association between the thyroid markers and the presence of MetS. The reported association measure was the prevalence ratio (PR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
Results
We analyzed 245 participants, the average age was 38.5 ± 10.3 years, 29.8% were males, and the prevalence of MetS was 31%. In the adjusted Poisson regression models, the prevalence of MetS was higher among the high FT3 tertile compared to the low tertile (aPR = 2.01; 95% CI: 1.22–3.34). The prevalence of MetS was higher among the intermediate FT3/FT4 ratio tertile and the high FT3/FT4 ratio tertile compared to the low tertile, (aPR = 1.78; 95% CI: 1.02–3.10) and (aPR = 2.80; 95% CI: 1.67–4.72); respectively.

Targeting biomarkers of oxidative-proinflammatory stress may result in improvement of modifiable metabolic syndrome, pre-diabetes and diabetes risk factors and subsequent risk reduction.
Methods
64 newly diagnosed antihyperglycemic treatment-naïve prediabetic and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients were randomly assigned using block design to either metformin combined with therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) or TLC alone. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting lipid profile, plasma oxidative status and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were measured at baseline, after 3 months and after 6 months from baseline.
Results
Except for HbA1c, baseline values did not differ significantly between the two groups. The post 3-months relative reductions in BMI (P=0.014) and HbA1c (P=0.037) in metformin combined with TLC intervention were significantly greater than those in TLC alone group. TNFα plasma levels were decreased significantly vs. baseline by metformin combined with TLC intervention (−22.90±46.76%, P=0.01). Conversely, TLC alone basically worsened proinflammatory status (42.40±40.82 %), P<0.001. Metformin with TLC treatment effected a therapeutic decrement of the oxidative stress (−15.44±35.32%, P=0.029 vs. baseline) unlike TLC alone (61.49±122.66%, P=0.01 vs. baseline). Both interventions' effects were sustained in the 6-month follow up periods.
Conclusion
In both intervention groups, the relative changes in plasma TNFα were significantly correlated (P<0.01) with systolic blood pressure and the relative changes in oxidative stress were markedly correlated (P<0.05) with total cholesterol."

It is being increasingly reported that some of the youth onset diabetes patients cannot be classified clearly as type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) based on usual criteria and the term double diabetes (DD) coined for these cases.
Aim
The objective of the study was to find out the prevalence of DD in youth onset diabetes patients from east Delhi and neighboring NCR region.
Methods
A total of 200 patients with youth onset diabetes below 25 years of age were recruited from a tertiary care hospital in East Delhi. Clinical history, family history of diabetes and anthropometry of patients were recorded. Fasting serum C-peptide, Anti-IA2-antibody and Anti-GAD-antibody were measured in all patients. Patients positive for Anti-GAD-antibody (>1.05U/ml) and C-peptide level >0.3nmol/l were characterized as DD patients. Patients negative for Anti-GAD-antibody and C-peptide >0.3nmol/l were kept under the category of T2DM. Patients with low C-peptide level along with one of the following, positive Anti-GAD-antibody, positive Anti-IA2-antibody and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) were considered as T1DM. Remaining patients were kept under the unknown category.
Results
Mean age of study subjects was 18.2±7.1years. Seven percent (7%) of the subjects were classified as DD, 51% as T1DM, 13% as T2DM and 29% were kept under the unknown category. Mean age of subjects with 22.2±9.7, 16.9±6.7, 20.6±7.7 and 19.4±7.4 years in DD, T1DM, T2DM and unknown category respectively. Mean BMI of subjects with DD, T1DM, T2DM and unknown category was 19.8±5.7, 16.6±3.7, 19.3±4.1 and 18.0±4.6 kg/m2 respectively.
Conclusion
Double diabetes is an important occurrence among youth onset diabetes subjects. Only half of the subjects with youth onset of diabetes had T1DM."

GLP-1 is also produced in the central nervous system (CNS), predominantly in the brainstem, and subsequently transported to a large number of regions in the CNS. Neuronal cells in nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) can synthesize GLP-1 and extends to hypothalamus, some thalamic and cortical areas. A G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) provides the majority of GLP-1 actions. GLP-1 receptor activation triggers some in vivo signaling pathways. GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) are used in the treatment diabetes and obesity. GLP-1 stimulates insulin secretion, inhibits glucagon secretion, decreases food intake, reduces appetite, delays gastric emptying, provides weight reduction, and protects β cells from apoptosis. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia. It is characterized by cognitive insufficiencies and behavioral changes that impact memory and learning abilities, daily functioning and quality of life. Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, which are known as pathophysiological features of the T2DM, have also been demonstrated to have significant impact on cognitive impairment. It is thought that GLP-1 affects neurological and cognitive functions, as well as its regulatory effect on glucose metabolism. The pathophysiological relationship between GLP-1 and AD is discussed in this review."

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 12 weeks of aerobic training on serum levels of high sensitivity C- reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), lipid profile and anthropometric characteristics in middle-aged women patients with type-2 diabetes.
Methods
A quasi-experimental study, 20 women patients with type-2 diabetes (mean age, 50.25 ± 4.36 years, Body mass index, 25.51 ± 2.91 kg/m2, and body fat percentage 23.67 ± 3.05%) were randomly categorized into two experimental and control groups. The protocol aerobic training included eight-minute jogging and eight-minute running with 75–85 percent maximum heart rate reserve in the first session. Per both sessions, one minute added to running time and it increased up to 32 min after 12 weeks. Blood sampling and anthropometric measurements, 24 h before and 48 h after the last training session were conducted.
Result
The result showed a significant reduction in hs-CRP and TNF-α in the experimental than control group (P = 0.01). Exercise training-treated patients showed a significant decrease in TG, LDL and increase HDL in comparison with baseline and the control group (P < .05). The results also showed a significant decrease in weight, body mass index, body fat percentage, and waist–hip ratio (P values 0.02, 0.03, 001, 0.04 respectively) following the 12 weeks aerobic training.
Conclusion
It seems that long-term aerobic training, improved some important anthropometric and biochemical parameters in patients with type-2 diabetes. These observations give a new insight into the mechanisms by which aerobic training can reduce the cardiovascular risk in diabetes."

A descriptive, observational study was completed in a tertiary care hospital between November 2014 and March 2016. Fifty consecutive patients of Type 2-Diabetes Mellitus who had been on metformin therapy for at least three months were included in our study. Several Parameters were compared with vitamin B12 levels and severity of peripheral neuropathy (using Toronto Clinical Scoring System (TCSS) and Nerve Conduction Velocity). These included the duration of diabetes, duration of metformin usage, dietary history, and HbA1c levels. Definite B12 deficiency was defined as B12<150pg/ml and possible B12 deficiency as <220pg/ml.
Results
In our study, we found a negative correlation between duration of metformin use and Vitamin B12 levels(r=−0.40). The mean Vitamin B12 levels seen in our study was 212.3pg/mL. There is a positive correlation between the duration of metformin therapy and peripheral neuropathy (r=0.40). The mean TCSS score was 6.8. The percentage of patients with mild neuropathy was 28%, with moderate neuropathy was 20% and severe neuropathy in 12% of the patients. The average duration of metformin use in patients without peripheral neuropathy was 5.5yrs whereas the average length of metformin use in patients with peripheral neuropathy was 10.4 yrs.
Conclusion
Patients on long-term metformin therapy are at a high risk for Vitamin B12 deficiency and peripheral neuropathy. Interval Screening for peripheral neuropathy is recommended for patients on metformin even if Vitamin B12 levels appear to be normal."

Besides its role in calcium homeostasis, vitamin D (VD) has an important immuno-mudulation effect. However, its role in autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes is under discussion. This study designed to investigate serum VD status in children and adolescents with and without diabetes.
Materials and methods
In a case-control study, 85 diabetic and 85 non-diabetic control (total 170) aged 1–15 yr. were enrolled. History of breast feeding and vitamin supplementation was obtained; growth indices and serum levels of Calcium, phosphorous, Alkaline-Phosphatase (ALP), Hemoglobin-A1c and VD were measured and analyzed.
Results
The mean values for VD in case and control groups were 12.80 ± 10.59 and 15.85 ± 9.92 nmol/L, respectively (p = 0.057). Serum VD status in these two groups was sufficient in 5.88% and 9.41%, insufficient in 18% and 14%, and deficient in 75.29% and 76.74%, respectively. Compared to the controls, diabetics had more history of breast-feeding (62.35% vs. 42.35%; p = 0.017) and higher serum ALP levels (772.34 ± 309.89 vs. 657.99 ± 395.11 U/L; p = 0.032).

abstract = "Aims
The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and the associated factors of metabolically unhealthy in normal-weight and metabolically healthy in obese.
Methods
We analyzed the data of a representative sample of 986 participants recruited among adult population of north of Iran. Data were collected regarding demographic characteristics, lifestyle, body mass index, abdominal obesity measures, blood pressure, and lipid profiles. The participants were classified as metabolically healthy obese (MHO) and metabolically unhealthy normal-weight (MUNW). Metabolically unhealthy was defined as the presence of  ≥2 non-obese components of metabolic syndrome based on ATP III criteria.
Results
The prevalence rate of MUNW and MHO accounted for 17.2% and 15.1% respectively. Mean age of participants with metabolically unhealthy was significantly greater than metabolically healthy in both normal weight and overweight/obese (P=0.001). The results of multiple logistic regression analysis showed in normal-weight individuals, a significant association of MUNW was found with age group of 50–59 years(OR=3.83, 95%CI: 1.71-8.57) and 60–70 years by OR=4.74(95%CI:1.79-12.54) as compared with age group of 20–29 years. It was also associated with current smoking. While metabolically healthy state in overweight/obese was inversely associated with age 50–59 years by OR=0.26 (95%CI:0.13-0.54) and age 60–70 years by OR=0.15 (95%CI:0.05- 0.39) and higher WC by OR=0.47 (95%CI:0.31-0.72) but positively associated with female-sex by OR=1.74 (95%CI:1.07-2.82).
Conclusion
Aging and smoking are significantly associated with metabolic abnormalities in normal-weight while aging, abdominal obesity negatively and female positively associated with metabolically healthy in obese."

abstract = "Aims
Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most prevalent and progressive metabolic conditions affecting approximately 8.5% of the global population. Individuals with T2DM have a significantly increased risk of developing chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its associated complications, therefore, it is of great importance to establish strategies for combatting T2DM and its associated chronic conditions. Current literature has identified several biomarkers that are known to play a key role in the pathogenesis of CVD. Many of these biomarkers affecting CVD are influenced by an increase in oxidative stress as seen in T2DM. The purpose of this review is to analyse and correlate the oxidative stress-related biomarkers that have been identified in the literature to provide an updated summary of their significance in CVD risk factors.
Data synthesis
This review has analysed current research on T2DM, CVD, and oxidative stress. Four key cardiovascular risk factors: thrombosis, inflammation, vascular homeostasis and cellular proliferation were searched to identify potential biomarkers for this review. These biomarkers stem from seven major cellular pathways; NF-κB, Keap1-Nrf2, protein kinase-C, macrophage activation, arachidonic acid mobilisation, endothelial dysfunction and advanced glycation end products.
Conclusions
The pathways and biomarkers were analysed to show their role as contributing factors to CVD development and a summary is made regarding the assessment of cardiovascular risk in T2DM individuals."

To date, no cardiovascular risk assessment tool has been developed specifically for any Arabian population including Omanis. This study aims to develop a suitable cardiovascular risk prediction model in the form of a statistical equation, for Omanis with type 2 diabetes.
Materials and methods
A sample of 2039 patients with type 2 diabetes selected from primary care settings in the Aldakhiliyah Province of Oman were involved in a retrospective cohort study. All patients were free of cardiovascular disease at baseline (in 2009–2010) and were followed up until: 1) their first cardiovascular event occurred; 2) the patient died, or 3) the end of the data collection in December 2015.
Results
Among the total sample, 192 cardiovascular disease events were recorded within a mean follow-up period of 5.3-year. The 5-year probability of a cardiovascular event was given as 1−0.9991Exp∑XiBi, where Exp ∑XiBi (hazard ratio)=Exp (0.038 age+0.052 DM duration+0.102 HbA1c+0.201 total cholesterol+0.912 albuminuria [1 if present]+0.166 hypertension [1 if present]+0.005 BMI).
Conclusion
The first cardiovascular risk prediction tool in the Arab world was developed in this study. It may be used to estimate the 5-year cardiovascular risk among Omanis with type 2 diabetes in order to plan patient management and preventive measures. However, further validation studies are required to determine the accuracy of the model."

The study was done to assess the magnitude of problems of metabolic syndrome among obese adolescents.
Materials and method
It was a cross-sectional study done from January 2013 to June 2014 in paediatric endocrine outpatient department in BIRDEM General Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Total 172 adolescents having exogenous obesity aged 10–18 years were included. Impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) were defined as per WHO criteria.The adolescents having Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥95th centile were classified as obese.Waist circumference was measured at the level midway between the lower rib margin & the iliac crest, at the level of umbilicus with the person breathing out gently in centimeter. Hip circumference was measured at the maximum width over the buttocks at the level of the greater trochanters in centimeter.
Result
Among 172 obese adolescents, metabolic syndrome was found in 66 patients (38.4%). The commonest metabolic abnormality among those having metabolic syndrome was low HDL level (77.3%) followed by high triglyceride level(71.2%). Glucose intolerance (IFG and/or IGT) was found in 16.7%, Type 2 DM in 10.6%, systolic hypertension in 10.7% and diastolic hypertension in 12.1%. Triglyceride (p = 0.042) and Cholesterol level (p = 0.016) were significantly higher and HDL-cholesterol level (p = 0.000) was significantly lower among obese adolescents having metabolic syndrome. Less physical activity (p = 0.04) was significantly related to the development of metabolic syndrome. On logistic regression analysis male sex, family history of obesity and low HDL-cholesterol correlated to metabolic syndrome.
Conclusion
The High rate of metabolic syndrome among obese adolescents is alarming."

In this article, we aimed to review and update scientific evidence regarding the relationships between obesity and its common physical health consequences, including CVD, T2DM, hypertension, ischemic stroke, cancer, dyslipidemia and reproductive disorders. In addition, the economic burden of OW and OB will be discussed. Abundant evidence is found to support the associations between obesity and other diseases. In general, the odd ratios, risk ratios or hazard ratios are often higher in OW and OB people than in the normal-weight ones. However, the molecular mechanism of how OW and OB induce the development of other diseases has not been fully understood. Figures also showed that obesity and its-related disorders exert enormous pressure on the economy which is projected to increase. This review highlights the fact that obesity can lead to numerous lethal health problems; therefore, it requires a lot of economic resources to fight against this epidemic."

Methods
This study used a questionnaire to obtain data regarding demographic details, current engagement in leisure time physical activities, and dosages of these exercises from participants between 18 and 64 years of age.
Results
Data was collected from a total of 390 participants (231 males and 159 females). 50.76% and 34.35% of the participants reported exercising voluntarily and for health benefits respectively. Most participants (94.61%) indicated exercising without prescription. 55.38% and 12.82% of the participants under and above 38 years of age perform moderate to vigorous intensity exercises respectively.
Conclusion
The over-all results of this study indicate that the participants’ choices of leisure time physical exercises are based on their personal choices and beliefs. The exercise intensities undertaken do not meet the global recommended intensities, especially in those above 38 years of age. Professionals and facilities to engage the public in the WHO recommended intensities of physical activity needs to be established."

We aimed to assess the association of vitamin D status with metabolic syndrome and its components among high educated Iranian adults.
Method
In this cross-sectional study, 352 faculty members with age of 35 years or more, belong to Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran, were recruited during 2016 and 2017. Fasting blood samples were obtained to quantify serum 25(OH)D concentrations, glycemic indicators and lipid profile. Metabolic syndrome was defined based on the guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III). Multivariate logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders was used to evaluate the association between vitamin D status and metabolic syndrome.
Result
Metabolic syndrome and vitamin D insufficiency were prevalent among 26% and 60.2% of subjects, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome across quartiles of 25(OH)D levels either before or after adjusting for potential confounders (OR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.43–1.95). In terms of metabolic syndrome components, subjects in the highest quartile of vitamin D levels had 59% decreased risk of abdominal obesity compared with those in the lowest quartile (OR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.17–0.99), after adjusting for potential confounders. Such inverse relationship was also seen for elevated blood pressure (OR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.14–0.99), and abnormal glucose homeostasis (OR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.19–0.85).

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age. The two main documented pathogenic mechanisms are hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenemia but there is growing evidence for increased predisposition to cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Our study aims to analyze the association of PCOS with cardiovascular risk factors.
Methods
This is a prospective study which targeted 100 PCOS patients from Civil Hospital Karachi over a period of one year (July 2016 to July 2017). An equal number of age-matched healthy control participants were also included in the study. The student’s t-test was used to assess the significance of differences using SPSS version (19). The statistical significance was set at a p-value of <.05.
Results
The most frequently presented feature associated with PCOS was primary infertility seen in 72% of the patients. Mean arterial pressure, fasting glucose and insulin levels and insulin resistance was found to be significantly different in PCOS patients as compared to their controls. A classic atherosclerotic lipid profile demonstrating elevated total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-C (LDL-C) levels and decreased serum high density lipoprotein-C(HDL-C) was observed in our study.
Conclusion
This study established a significant yet independent association of PCOS with major cardiovascular risk factors. This association can effectively progress into CVD outcomes which necessitates early intervention programs and preventative strategies to reduce mortality from cardiovascular events. This study lays out the framework for conducting further researches on the PCOS women while exploring novel cardiovascular risk factors."

This cross-sectional study included 11,114 participants who were professional drivers of commercial motor vehicles, and were enrolled in the Iranian Health Surveys between 2014 and 2016. Diagnosis of metabolic syndrome was made according to International Diabetes Federation criteria. Clinical data, including anthropometric measurements and serum parameters, were collected. Odds ratios for hematological parameters and metabolic syndrome were calculated using binary logistic regression models.
Results
We found that hemoglobin; platelet, and white blood cell counts increased with increasing numbers of metabolic syndrome components (p<0.05 for all). The odds ratio of metabolic syndrome significantly increased across successive quartiles of platelet (1.00, 1.25, 1.29, and 1.51) and white blood cell counts (1.00, 1.51, 1.79, and 2.11) with the lowest quartile as the referent group. Similar associations for hemoglobin and hematocrit in the top quartile were also observed. We did not observe any significant difference in the mean of neutrophil count, mean platelet volume (MPV), red cell distribution width, or platelet distribution width among participants with or without metabolic syndrome.

Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the influence of antioxidant vitamins on the efficacy of oral hypoglycemic therapy in type 2 diabetic patients (T2DM). This single-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial aimed to investigate the effect of vitamin C and/or E supplementation on the efficacy of oral hypoglycemic therapy in T2DM Palestinian male patients from the Gaza Strip.
Methods
Forty T2DM male patients aged 40–60 years on metformin treatment were randomly divided into four groups, each group received an additional one of the following daily oral supplements for 90 days: placebo; vitamin C; vitamin E and vitamin C plus vitamin E. After overnight fasting, venous blood specimens were collected from all individuals into K3-EDTA tubes and serum tubes for measuring the biochemical and hematological parameters of the study at baseline and after 90 days of vitamins supplementation.
Results
The results revealed that vitamin C and/or E improve fasting blood sugar (FBS), HbA1c, lipid profile, insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), reduced glutathione (GSH); and Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QISCI) compared with diabetic patients group that received placebo.
Conclusion
This study provided additional evidence on the beneficial effects of supplementing antioxidant vitamins in T2DM which could improve the clinical condition and attenuate or prevent diabetic pathogenesis and complications that, secondly to poor glycemic control, could attribute to the imbalance between the decline in the endogenous antioxidants and increasing production of the reactive oxygen species leading to the oxidant-mediated damage present in the diabetic context."

The prevalence of overweight and obesity was 26.2%, with significant increase among males (36.4%) compared with females (19.1%). The prevalence of MetS among obese and overweight was (28.6%) according to IDF with no significant increase compared to NCEP ATP criteria (24%). Reduced HDL- cholesterol was the most prevalent component (74.7%) in obese and overweight participants followed by central obesity (72.1%), raised blood pressure (29.9%), elevated fasting blood sugar (24%), and lastly increased triglycerides (18.2%). No significant differences were found between males and females according to both criteria. Moreover, no significant associations with geographic locality, house-hold income, smoking, physical activity, or family history were determined.
Conclusions
The prevalence of MetS among overweight and obese young adult Palestinians was high and demands immediate intervention, given the potential for these adults to develop chronic diseases."

Aim of the study
The primary objective is to determine the prevalence of inflammation, malnutrition and atherosclerosis in patients on maintenance haemodialysis. Secondary objective was to determine the association for atherosclerosis with inflammation and malnutrition.
Patient and methods
One hundred and one adult patients with end stage renal disease on maintenance haemodialysis who are met with the exclusion criteria were enrolled in this cross sectional study from haemodialysis unit of Baghdad teaching hospital over the period of July/2015 − June 2016. All patients were thoroughly examined and many variables were evaluated (age, gender, blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, serum lipid profile, smoking habits, serum albumin, CRP, calcium, Phosphate, Parathyroid hormone and haemoglobin measurements). All patients underwent a carotid Doppler ultrasound study.
Results
Atherosclerosis was present in 65.3%: 58.4% of patients had malnutrition and 43.6% had inflammation. The association for atherosclerosis and high CRP and low serum albumin is strong and independent of other atherosclerosis risk factors. There is significant inverse and independent correlation between CRP and albumin.
Conclusion
Inflammation (high serum CRP) and malnutrition (low serum albumin) in patients on haemodialysis are significantly associated with carotid atherosclerosis. Inflammation was more prevalent in the malnourished patients than in those with normal nutritional status."

Expeditious and precise discerning of bacterial pathogens is a fundamental grail, of clinical diagnostic microbiology. Genotypic detection is a budding substitute to recognize phenotypic culture based processes in bacterial identification.
Aims
We report a comparative evaluation of biochemical and genomic-based assays for exploring the commonest bacterial flora of infected diabetic foot ulcers along with clinical variables of subjects enrolled.
Methods
The pathogens selected (i) Staphylococcus aureus ii) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, iii) Escherichia coli and iv) Klebsiella pneumonia, stood for the most frequent isolates of diabetic foot infection in previous studies from Northern India. Identification of these pathogens were done by conventional assays and polymerase chain reaction.
Results
Of 50 specimens obtained from infected DFUs, 74% of cases were affirmative by bacteriological assays and 90% showed positivity via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Among processed samples 44 isolates were detectable through phenotypic analysis and 65 bacteria by species-specific PCR. Thirteen samples and 21 isolates could not be scrutinized by phenotypic identification systems. The most prevalent pathogens identifiable were Klebsiella pneumonia, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli.
Conclusions
We have shown that PCR-based diagnostic methods improved the identification compared to conventional methods and highlight the incorporation of PCR due to shorten turnaround time translating into improved clinical outcomes."

To study the effect of parental history of diabetes on markers of inflammation, insulin resistance, adiposity indices and carotid intima media thickness (cIMT) in first degree relatives of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Materials and methods
Normal glucose tolerant (NGT) first degree relatives of T2DM patients of age group 20–40 years designated as FHpositive were enrolled in the cross sectional study. Depending on the parental history of diabetes they were divided into three groups: family history positive in father (FHfather), family history positive in mother (FHmother) and family history positive in both (FHboth). Age, sex and BMI matched controls without any history of diabetes in their parents designated as FHnegative were taken for comparison. All subjects underwent detailed clinical evaluation and biochemical investigations. cIMT and adiposity indices like visceral adipose tissue thickness (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness (SAT) were assessed using ultrasonography.
Results
No difference existed with regards to BMI, hsCRP, degree of insulin resistance, adiposity markers and cIMT between FHmother and FHfather group. Subjects in FHboth group had significantly higher degree of insulin resistance, subclinical inflammation, increased atherosclerosis and adiposity indices in contrast to those who have a single parent T2DM family history.
Conclusions
hsCRP and cIMT are significantly higher in the first degree relatives of type2 diabetes mellitus patients than controls. Individuals with history of T2DM in both parents have significantly worse glycemic status, increased cIMT and adverse cardiovascular risk profile than those with T2DM history in only single parent."

Materials and methods
In this descriptive cross-sectional study, 605 patients with diabetes were evaluated in July 2014. A checklist was used to obtain demographic data, diabetes related data, past medical history, and physical examination data.
Results
The prevalence of diabetic foot ulcer was 6.4% (95% CI: 4.64–8.73). Seventeen cases of them were female (4.9%). In univariate analysis, the following variables had statistically significant relationship with DFU prevalence: diabetes duration, educational level, 10 g monofilament sensation, Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) and Body Mass Index (BMI). Patients' age, glycemic control and smoking did not show any significant relationship with DFU. After logistic regression analysis, the patients with decreased 10 g monofilament sensation had DFU more than patients with normal sensation (OR = 8.84, 95% CI: 3.5–22.3). Abnormal ABI increased the odds of DFU (OR = 5.6, 95% CI: 1.3–24.18). The DFU prevalence in patients with diabetes duration of 11–20 years, was more than patients with ≤5 years (OR = 3.8, 95% CI: 1.33–10.8).The odds of DFU development in educated patients compared with illiterate patients was 0.27(95% CI: 0.12–0.57). BMI had a significant relationship with DFU prevalence. The odds in overweight patients was 0.259(95% CI: 0.108–0.623) and in obese patients was 0.263 (95% CI: 0.1–0.687).
Conclusion
The prevalence of DFU was 6.4% in this study. Final associated risk factors of DFU were decreased 10 g monofilament sensation, abnormal ABI, diabetes duration, educational level and BMI."

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and diabetes mellitus (DM) are some of the leading causes of death in the world, and diet has roles in their etiology. This research study therefore investigates the glycemic index (GI) of soy flour fortified whole wheat meal (SFFWWM) consumed with Talinum triangulare (gbure) soup and the effects of the meal on the lipid profiles of the test human subjects.
Methods
The control human subjects and test human subjects were fed D-glucose (DG) and whole wheat meal (WWM) with Talinum triangulare soup respectively on the first day of the experiment, and SFFWWM with the same soup the next day (for test subjects only) after 10–12h overnight fasting. Blood glucose levels of the subjects were taken before and 2h after meals’ consumption at 30min interval and blood samples collected for lipid profiles evaluations.
Results
The result of the study showed that; SFFWWM consumed with Talinum trianguilare soup has a non-significant lower GI than WWM consumed with the same soup, but a significant lower GI than DG at (P<0.05). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in lipid profiles of the test human subjects between when they consumed WWM and SFFWWM with the soup however, SFFWWM reduced TC, TG, LDL-C and VDL-C and increased HDL-C and TP than WMM at (P<0.05). In addition, GI is positively correlated with TC, TG, LDL-C and VLDL-C, but is negatively correlated with TP and HDL-C.
Conclusion
It can therefore be concluded that; fortifying WWM with soy flour would reduce the risk factors of CVDs and DM, the diseases recently claiming thousands of today."

Elevated cardiac troponin I, Creatine kinase (CK-MB) and Myoglobin levels are observed in the setting of acute myocardial damage. However sub-clinical elevations occur in patients with diabetes mellitus. This study was carried out to determine the relationship between the presence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors and the metabolic syndrome and elevations in cardiac markers in patients with type2 diabetes mellitus.
Subjects and methods
Consecutive stable out-patients with type2 diabetes mellitus at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital, Nigeria were recruited. Non-diabetic individuals such as hospital staff and the general public acted as controls. Baseline demographic data collection was done and waist circumference, weight, height and blood pressure were measured. Venous samples were assayed for CTnI, CK-MB and Myoglobin levels using ELISA. Data was analysed using SPSS v 20.
Results
There were 188 DM patients, who were older than the 200 control subjects (56.1 ± 13.1 years and 42.7 ± 5.7 years, p < 0.001). Mean duration of diabetes was 7.1(5.7) years. Hypertension was present in 59%, 84.6% had dyslipidaemia, while 76.1% had metabolic syndrome. All the cardiac markers were significantly higher in DM patients than controls. The presence of hypertension or dyslipidaemia was not significantly associated with the cardiac markers (p > 0.05 for all), however the DM patients with metabolic syndrome had higher levels of CK-MB and myoglobin but not CTnI than those without.

Patients of diabetes mellitus experience psychological difficulties associated with their disease which remains unrecognized involving several states related to coping with diabetes. Diabetes distress is a distinct condition which is often mistaken for depression and is related to adverse disease outcomes.
Aims and objective
To study the prevalence and predictors of diabetes distress in patients of Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a tertiary care centre.
Materials and methods
This cross-sectional study was conducted over a period of one year at Endocrine OPD of Pt. B.D. Sharma PGIMS, Rohtak, a tertiary care centre in northern India. 410 consecutive patients having T2DM attending the endocrine OPD were screened for psychiatric disorders and 189 diabetic patients with no underlying psychiatric disorders were included in the study. Their socio-demographic and relevant clinical variables were recorded. Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS) was used to measure distress due to the disease in these patients.
Results
It was found that the prevalence of diabetes distress was 18.0%; among them 16.1% had emotion related distress, 5.6% regimen related distress, 1.5% interpersonal related distress and 1.2% physician related diabetes distress. The major predictors for high diabetes distress scores among diabetic cases were low education level, retinopathy, neuropathy and hypertension.
Conclusion
The present study suggests that emotion related diabetes distress was more prevalent among diabetic patients. Lower education level and the presence of diabetic complications contribute as risk factors for high diabetes distress."

Study design
Prospective observational study.
Material and methods
The study was conducted on 300 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus attending the outpatient department of a tertiary care teaching hospital. All patients underwent hepatic ultrasonography to look for hepatic steatosis. Among the 300 patients, 124 were divided into NAFLD and non-NAFLD groups based on the ultrasound findings. These patients were subjected to electrocardiogram, 2D echocardiogram, carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) measurement and ankle brachial pressure index measurement along with measurement of markers of oxidative stress.
Results
Hepatic steatosis was present in 61% of diabetic patients in this study. Cardiovascular disease was not found to be significantly associated in diabetic patients with NAFLD. However, cardiovascular risk factors like CIMT, high sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were elevated in these patients. hs-CRP and MDA levels were found to be significantly associated with the severity of NAFLD.
Conclusion
There is a high prevalence of NAFLD in type 2 diabetic patients. No correlation was detected between the presence of NAFLD and cardiovascular disease in them; although there was an association between cardiovascular risk factors and NAFLD."

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common in type 2 diabetes and limits the treatment choices for glycaemic control. Our aim was to examine real-world prescribing for managing hyperglycaemia in the presence of CKD.
Methods
The SAIL (Secure Anonymised Information Linkage) databank was used to examine prescribing during the period from the 1st of January to 30th December 2014. CKD was defined as:- none or mild CKD, eGFR ≥60mL/min/1.73m2; moderate CKD eGFR <60mL/min/1.73m2; and severe CKD eGFR <30mL/min/1.73m2 or requiring dialysis.
Results
We identified 9585 subjects who received any form of glucose lowering therapy (8363 had no/mild CKD; 1137 moderate CKD; 85 severe CKD). There was a linear association between insulin use and CKD severity with approximately 54% of those with severe CKD receiving insulin. Sulphonylureas use did not differ among the CKD groups and was approximately 40%. Metformin showed a linear decrease across the groups, however approximately 21% in the severe CKD group received metformin. The use of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) was approximately 20% and did not differ among groups. The DPP-4 inhibitor choice was:- 1% vildagliptin, 9% saxagliptin, 58% sitagliptin, and 32% linaglitpin. With respect to sitagliptin and saxagliptin, 72% and 62% received an inappropriately high dose in the setting of CKD.
Conclusions
We observed that a considerable proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD were receiving metformin and non dose-adjusted DPP-4 inhibitors. Careful consideration of medication use and dosaging is required in the setting of CKD and type 2 diabetes."

Peripheral neuropathy is one of the main complications of diabetes mellitus. One of the features of diabetic nerve damage is abnormality of sensory and motor nerve conduction study. An electrophysiological examination can be reproduced and is also a non-invasive approach in the assessment of peripheral nerve function. Population-based and clinical studies have been conducted to validate the sensitivity of these methods. When the diagnosis was based on clinical electrophysiological examination, abnormalities were observed in all patients.
Method
In this research, using a review design, we reviewed the issue of clinical electrophysiological examination of diabetic peripheral neuropathy in articles from 2008 to 2017. For this purpose, PubMed, Scopus and Embase databases of journals were used for searching articles.
Results/findings
The researchers indicated that diabetes (both types) is a very disturbing health issue in the modern world and should be given serious attention. Based on conducted studies, it was demonstrated that there are different procedures for prevention and treatment of diabetes-related health problems such as diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN). The first objective quantitative indication of the peripheral neuropathy is abnormality of sensory and motor nerve conduction tests. Electrophysiology is accurate, reliable and sensitive. It can be reproduced and also is a noninvasive approach in the assessment of peripheral nerve function.
Conclusion
The methodological review has found that the best method for quantitative indication of the peripheral neuropathy compared with all other methods is clinical electrophysiological examination. For best results, standard protocols such as temperature control and equipment calibration are recommended."

abstract = "Aim
Glycated albumin (GA) suggested being alternative glycemic marker than haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) in patients with chronic kidney diseases (CKD). We investigated the association between GA and the progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN) in T2DM subjects.
Methods
We recruited T2DM subjects with different stages of CKD who had regularly measured serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) according to Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines, HbA1c consecutively every 3 months along with GA levels and other anthropometric and demographic measurements. We grouped age and sex matched subjects into the CKD progression, Group I healthy subjects (n = 100, M: F;50:50). Group II T2DM subjects with eGFR ≥90 mL/min (n = 167, M:F; 76:91). Group III of T2DM patients with eGFR 60–89 mL/min (n = 91, M:F; 44:47). Group IV T2DM subjects with eGFR 30–59 mL/min (n = 68, M:F;31:37). Group V T2DM with eGFR ≤ 29 mL/min (n = 21, M:F; 13:8).
Results
Pearson’s correlation analysis between glycated albumin and biochemical parameters were established in all subjects. GA/HbA1c ratio increases with poor glycemic control except for nephrosis state.
Conclusion
Mean GA levels were more closely associated with DN progression than mean HbA1c in subjects with T2DM and can be implemented as an alternative diagnostic marker in nephropathy."

abstract = "Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is one of the major complications associated with diabetes. It is characterized by the degeneration of the myelin sheath around axons, referred to as demyelination. Such demyelinations are often caused by reduced lipid component of the myelin sheath. Since, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) provides the lipid for myelin sheath by hydrolysing the triglyceride rich lipoproteins, and also helps in the uptake of lipids by the Schwann cells (SCs) for its utilization, LPL is considered as the important factor in the regeneration of myelin sheath during diabetic neuropathy. Earlier reports from our laboratory have provided the insights of insulin and its receptor in SCs during diabetic neuropathy. In order to evaluate the long term effect of insulin on lipid metabolism during diabetic neuropathy, in this study, we analyzed the expression of LPL in SCs under normal, high glucose and insulin treated conditions. A decrease in the expression of LPL was observed in SCs of high glucose condition and it was reversed upon insulin treatment. Histochemical observations of sciatic nerve of insulin treated neuropathy subjects showed the improved nerve morphology, signifying the importance of insulin in restoring the pathophysiology of diabetic neuropathy."

abstract = "Objective
Several methods are available to calculate glycemic variability (GV), quality of glycemic control (QGC) and glycemic risk (GR). However, clinicians do not easily interpret these data. This study evaluates whether the results of the different methods can be interpreted as equivalent.
Methods
A prospective study was performed including outpatients with DMT2 evaluated at the San Ignacio Hospital and the Colombian Diabetes Association in Bogotá, Colombia. From six-day continuous glucose monitoring data, GV (SD, CV, IQR, MODD, MAGE), QGC (M-value, J-index) and GR (LBGI, HBGI) were calculated. Reference values ​​were generated, classifying the patients according to GV control quartiles (excellent, good, fair or poor). The concordance between the different indices was evaluated.
Results
In total, 140 patients (68.9 ± 11.2 years) were included. The agreement levels (Kappa) between GV indices were moderate, 0.40 (CI 95%:0.29–0.51), 0.42 (CI 95%:0.31–0.53) and 0.39 (CI 95%:0.28–0.50), for CV versus SD, IQR and CONGA respectively. The levels of agreement between GV and QGC indices were minimal (Kappa CV vs. M-value, 0.15CI 95%:0.046–0.26) and weak between the GV and GR indices (Kappa CVvs.LBGI 0.37CI95%:0.26–0.48). The estimators did not improve significantly when the analysis was performed with linearly weighted or quadratic weighted Kappa.
Conclusions
The present study demonstrates that the concordance between the clinical interpretation of the different GV, QGC and GR indices is poor, suggesting that they cannot be assumed as equivalent, so different indices evaluating different concepts, must be evaluated simultaneously to analyze adequately each patient. New studies are needed to evaluate which of the methods better predicts hypoglycemia and microvascular or macrovascular complications."

This study investigated the associations of vitamin D status (i.e., serum 25(OH)D concentration) with markers of metabolic health and metabolic syndrome (MS), as well as possible gender differences in these associations, with metabolic syndrome (MS) for a sample from Shanghai, China.
Methods
Demographic and anthropometric data, as well as 25-hydroxyvitamin D (serum 25(OH)D), blood glucose, and lipid concentrations were obtained for 508 urban residents aged 19–70 years. After grouping into tertiles according to their serum 25(OH)D concentrations, linear and logistic regressions were used to evaluate associations between serum 25(OH)D concentration and risk factors for MS across tertiles.
Results
A 1 ng/mL increase in 25(OH)D was associated with a significant decrease in total cholesterol by 0.25 mmol/L [95% CI: (−0.44, −0.05); P = 0.014] for the third tertile, with reference to the first tertile. Also, 1 ng/mL increase in 25(OH)D was associated with a significant decrease in LDL by 0.18 mmol/L [95% CI: (−0.35, −0.02); P = 0.026] for the third tertile. In addition, participants in the third tertile had a 54% reduction in the OR for MS [95% CI: (−1.10,− 0.02), P = 0.041]. Lastly, while there was no gender difference in vitamin D deficiency status, the non-MS women had significantly higher 25(OH)D level than those with MS (30.1 ± 5.8 vs. 28.5 ± 5.9 ng/mL, P = 0.035), while no such difference was observed for men.
Conclusions
Higher serum 25(OH)D concentration was associated with a better metabolic profile and thus a lower risk for developing MS in urban Shanghai residents of China."

Among the most common metabolic disorders during pregnancy is gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This research was conducted to examine the dietary pattern in women with GDM.
Material and methods
In this case-study, 204 pregnant women (104 cases and 100 control women) were chosen through convenient sampling and random sampling. The subjects' food intakes were assessed using semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, while their activities evaluated by physical activity questionnaire. Anthropometric indices were measured based on standard instructions, and the body mass index was calculated. The dietary patterns were determined using principal component analysis and its relationship with preeclampsia was tested using logistic regression method.
Results
Unhealthy and healthy dietary patterns were found among the pregnant women. In the unhealthy group, after modifying the effect of confounding variables, a significant relationship was observed between dietary pattern and having gestational diabetes (OR = 2.838,95% CI:1.039–7.751). In the healthy group, on the other hand, the people in the fourth quartile had 149% and 184% higher chance not to catch gestational diabetes before and after modification with confounders, respectively (OR = 0.284,95% CI:0.096–0.838), when compared with people in the first quartile.
Conclusion
The findings indicated that selection of foods including fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairies, etc. as healthy dietary pattern is associated with diminished risk of GDM among pregnant women. Determining healthy dietary pattern during pregnancy, considering the foods consumed among pregnant women, as a useful and practical guide during this period can be publicized for training and nutritional interventions."

The aim of this study was to assess the association between the LDLC levels and the incidence of T2D in an Iranian high-risk population not treated with lipid-lowering medications.
Methods
Mean 10-year follow-up data (1819) in non-diabetic first-degree relatives (FDR) of consecutive patients with T2D 30–70 years old, who were not treated with lipid-lowering drugs at baseline were examined. The diagnosis of T2D based on serial oral glucose tolerance test was the primary outcome. Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for the incidence of T2D within tertiles of LDLC.
Results
A higher LDLC concentration was significantly associated with higher risk of T2D. Compared with the first tertile, the adjusted risk of T2D increased for the second (HR 1.20, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.35, P < 0.01) and third (HR 1.22, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.37, P < 0.01), tertiles of LDLC.

Dyslipidemia is one of the major risk factors for atherosclerosis and the main cause of death in the developing and developed countries. In this cohort study, the incidence of dyslipidemia and its components have been studied among individuals over 20 years old in Ahvaz, southwest of Iran.
Materials and methods
The Phase 1 of this study was conducted on the prevalence of Metabolic syndrome and its related factors by Diabetes Research Center in 2009. The target population included individuals over 20 years old who were selected using cluster sampling in Ahvaz health centers. In the second phase of the study, 5 years later in 2014, subjects were again recalled by health centers. Questionnaires, anthropometric indices and measurements were repeated similar to Phase 1. The blood sample was taken from everyone after 12h of fasting and then the factors (Chol, TG, HDL) were measured.
Results
The cumulative incidence of dyslipidemia obtained 60.7% (males 56.7% and females 64.8%). lipid profile {HDL, Triglycerides and Cholesterol had changes in their means(a significant reduction in the mean about 10, 22.25 and 13 units respectively) between baseline and 5 years later. Waist circumference here associated with incidence of high LDL and high chol, also sex and High LDL ‘educational level and daily consumption of vegetables were associated with incidence of low HDL and dyslipidemia respectively.
Conclusion
Age, educational level and daily intake of fruits and vegetables were effective variables on incidence of dyslipidemia. According to various studies, LDL and HDL levels in different regions of Iran, seems to be influenced by factors such as climate, nutrition and activity levels."

Variants in Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1 alpha (HNF1A) gene are associated with Metabolic Syndromeand its components independently. In this study, we aimed to assess the statistical association of the rs1169288, rs2464196 and rs735396 variants and haplotypes of HNF1A gene with metabolic syndrome (MS) and its components in a Moroccan population sample.
Methods
Three variants in the HNF1A gene were genotyped, rs1169288 A>C, rs2464196 G>A and rs735396 T>C in cases and controls from Moroccan population using KASPar® technology (KBioscience, UK). Anthropometric and biochemical parameters were assessed. MS was defined according to the international Diabetes Federation (IDF). The effects of HNF1A polymorphisms and constructed haplotypes on MS were estimated using logistic regression analyses.
Results
The HNF1A gene, rs1169288 and rs2464196 variants conferred an increased risk to MS (OR=2.08, 95%CI=1.38–3.14, P=0.0005 and OR=1.52, 95%IC=1.05–2.20, P=0.03, respectively) when adjusted for BMI, sex and age. We found that the C allele of the variant rs735396 was associated with an increased triglycerides level (p-value=0.04434) among patients and high weist circumference (P=0.02005) and total cholesterol (P=0.03227) amount among controls. The haplotype AAT (OR=5.656, P<0.00001) was the most significantly associated with susceptibility to metabolic syndrome.
Conclusion
The present study demonstrated that SNPs rs1169288 and rs2464196 of HNF1A gene were significantly associated with metabolic syndrome in a Morrocan population. Furthermore, the CAC, AAC, AAT and AGT haplotypes of these SNPs and rs735396 were significantly associated with metabolic syndrome."

Methods
The study was conducted at the medicine department of Bangabandhu Shiekh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) during May 2012 to May 2013. Equal number of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients and non-diabetic subjects (patient attendants) were recruited from outpatient department matching for age (±2 years) and gender. Demographic and anthropometric data were collected from all the subjects. Depression was assessed using, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire. A subject with a score above 8 was considered as depressive. Baseline characteristics of diabetic and non-diabetic participants were compared using chi square test. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess the association between diabetes and depression adjusting for all plausible confounders in the model.
Results
24.8% non-diabetic and 56.2% diabetic subjects were found to have depression. Statistically significant difference was found in income, waist-to-hip ratio between diabetic and non-diabetic subjects (P<0.001). Diabetic patients show 7-fold greater odds of having depression in comparison to their non-diabetic counterpart [OR 7.0, 95% CI (3.4, 14.3)]. Female gender appeared as significant predictor of depression [OR 4.3, 95% CI (2.1, 8.9)].
Conclusions
In Bangladeshi population, people with diabetes are 7 times more likely to have co-existing depression in comparison to non-diabetic subjects. Further studies are required to establish the nature of the relationship between depression and T2DM."

abstract = "Background
Previous studies have demonstrated that hemoglobin-haptoglobin (Hb-Hp) complex plays a role in developing vascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The complexes bind with Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), affecting the function of Lecithin:Cholesterol Acyltransferase (LCAT), and impairing the reverse cholesterol transport mechanism (RCT). This study investigated the influence of Hp phenotypes on serum levels of ApoA1 and LCAT in patients with T2DM.
Methods
The study comprised 131 T2DM patients and 111 matching healthy controls. Fasting blood glucose, HbA1C, and lipid profile were determined by chemistry autoanalyzer, LCAT and ApoA1 by ELISA, and Hp phenotypes by gel electrophoresis.
Results
Irrespective of Hp phenotypes, fasting blood glucose, HbA1C, and lipid profile were significantly higher in patients than in controls, while HDL-cholesterol, ApoA1, and LCAT were lower. ApoA1 correlated positively with LCAT (r=0.223, p=0.024) and HDL-cholesterol (r=0.255, 0.003) in patients only. When Hp polymorphism was taken into account, the levels of LCAT and ApoA1 were significantly lower in patients with Hp2-2 than that in patients of Hp1-1 and/or Hp2-1. Correlations between ApoA1 and each of HDL-cholesterol and LCAT (r=0.239, p=0.046, and r=0.252, p=0.040, respectively) were also observed, but only in patients with Hp2-2 phenotype.
Conclusions
The reduced levels of LCAT and ApoA1 observed in this study support the suggestion that T2DM patients with Hp2-2 phenotype could have altered RCT mechanism and increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease."

An association between metabolic syndrome (MeS) and osteoarthritis (OA) has been reported in recent years; however, conflicting findings have been reported regarding this matter. Inhere we evaluated the relationship between different components of MeS and OA in a Fasa osteoarthritis registry (FOAS).
Methods
The registry includes all OA cases who referred to Fasa hospital (Iran) since 2013. Overall, 131 patients with OA with a Kellgren & Lawrence (K&L) score >1 and 261 controls were compared.
Results
Overall, 82.4% of individuals in the OA group and 40.8% of participants in the control group had MeS (P<0.001). Patients with OA had a 6.8 (95% CI: 4.1–11.4) higher chance of acquiring MeS. After adjusting for sex, age, and BMI, odds’ ratio (OR) for acquiring MeS in OA group increased to 10.9 (95% CI: 5.5–21.8). Among MeS criteria’s, high waist circumference (WC) has strongest correlation for acquiring OA (OR=27.535, 95% CI: 6.003–126.306).
Conclusion
Our findings revealed that metabolic markers are strongly associated with OA and the addition of each component of the MeS, significantly increases the risk of developing OA, therefore control of metabolic factors and appropriate screening must be considered in health policy making and prevention programs."

Electronic health data in the form of International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes is routinely used for clinical research, yet the accuracy of specific diagnoses is largely unknown. The purpose of this study is to assess the validity of computer extracted problem lists for diabetic retinopathy (DR) and other complications of diabetes mellitus (DM) within the VA Greater Los Angeles Health Administration (VHAGLA).
Methods
The study population consisted of patients at the VHAGLA with an ICD-9 diagnosis of DM between Jan 1st 1999 and March 22nd 2016 with visits to the eye clinic. Fifty patients either with or without an ICD-9 diagnosis of DR were randomly selected. The accuracy of ICD-9 codes for DR, as well as related co-morbidities such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease (CAD), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA), were assessed through chart review.
Results
A total of 3193 patients met our inclusion criteria. Of the 50 patients with an ICD-9 diagnosis of DR, the positive predictive value (PPV) was 0.7. For 50 patients without a ICD-9 diagnosis of DR, the negative predictive value (NPV) was 0.9. Of the other co-morbid medical conditions, NPV ranged from a low of 63% for obesity to a high of 98% for CVA and CAD.
Conclusion
Validity of ICD-9 diagnoses of diabetic complications in this VA population varied considerably, with DR demonstrating moderate agreement, obesity being more under-documented, and CVA and CAD being more consistently documented. These discrepancies should be considered when using billing codes for research purposes."

Understanding the metabolic syndrome has been the center of attention in recent years as a major risk factor of many diseases. Given the rising incidence of this disease and as the patient can compete against this disease with choosing healthy lifestyle, in the present study, we investigated the predictors of metabolic syndrome, based on Walker’s health-promoting lifestyle in two large cities in Iran, in 2016.
Methods
This cross-sectional study used two-stage cluster sampling to select 1128 patients, among patients who referred to health centers in Isfahan and Yazd. Data were gathered by Walker lifestyle questionnaire that evaluates health-promoting behavior (nutrition, physical activity, health responsibility, spiritual growth, interpersonal relations, and stress management) by self-report that were completed by interviews for illiterate and semi-literate individuals. Data analysis was performed by SPSS statistical software.
Results
In this study, 576 women and 454 men participated with mean age of 56.19±12.11years and mean weight of 73.90±14.45kg.
Results
showed that the highest mean score for different health-promoting behaviors was related to social responsibility (25.53±5.65) and the lowest was related to nutritional status (15.18±5.79). Regarding the strongest predictor of lifestyle, the results of regression analysis showed that the most direct impact was related to stress management (R2=0.343) and the least direct impact was related to social responsibility (R2=0.243). Among the structures, physical activity with overall effect of R2=0.621 was the strongest predictor of lifestyle based on Walker’s pattern.

Methods
Total 85 cases of with type 2 diabetes mellitus were screened for vitamin D status of which 71 patients were vitamin D insufficient/deficient. They were randomized into two intent to treat groups with different vitamin D supplementation protocols (a) Oral-60000 IU per day for 5days (group I; n=40) and (b) injectable-300000 IU intramuscularly once (group II; n=31). Baseline and one month post supplementation 25(OH) vitamin D levels were measured in both the groups.
Results
Baseline clinical characteristics and 25(OH) vitamin D levels were comparable in both the groups. Post treatment 25(OH) vitamin D level in group I was 26.06±9.06ng/ml and in group II was 49.69±18.92ng/ml. After one month of vitamin D supplementation, increment in 25(OH) vitamin D level from baseline was significantly higher in group II than group I (p<0.001).
Interpretation & conclusions
Injectable method of supplementation was better than oral route in improving serum 25 (OH) vitamin D status in patients with type 2 diabetes. The study suggested impaired absorption of vitamin D from the gastrointestinal tract in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a need for parenteral route of vitamin D supplementation in deficient patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."

Method
In this cross sectional study thyroid function tests were analyzed in 16 diabetic ketoacidosis patients according to American diabetic association before and after insulin therapy.
Result
mean triiodothyronine (T3) level before and after ketoacidosis treatment were 63.2±28.2ng/dl/and 78.5±26.2ng/dl (P. value 0.00) respectively and the mean thyroxin level (T4) before and after ketoacidosis were 3.18±1.4ng/dl and 5.17±2.4ng/dl (P. value=0.00) .Mean thyrotropin (TSH) level and triiodothyronine uptake (T3RU) before and after treatment showed no significant difference.
Conclusion
Diabetic ketoacidosis is a sever systemic disease which along with reduction in T3 level, T4 level is also decreased and TSH level is normal. The changes in Thyroid hormones are reversed to normal after treatment of ketoacidosis so it is recommended in interpreting results of TFT in these patients we should consider these facts and thyroid function test should be repeated after treatment."

The use of second-generation atypical antipsychotics has an increasing role in the development of metabolic syndrome. However, these medications due to metabolic disorders can lead to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and subsequently mortality as well as reduced adherence to treatment. The main objective of current study was to determine the ability of melatonin to reduce the metabolic effects of second-generation antipsychotics.
Methods
This double blind controlled clinical trial was conducted on 100 patients aged 18–64 years old were treated with the second-generation antipsychotics for the first time. The patients were divided randomly into two groups of 50. The case group received slow-release melatonin at a dose of 3mg and the control group was given oral placebo at 8 p.m.
Results
The findings in melatonin group indicated significantly increase of HDL and decreased fasting blood sugar and systolic blood pressure, as well as had statistically significant increase in waist circumference, weight and BMI compared with placebo group.
Conclusion
According to the findings, it can be claimed that the addition of melatonin to atypical antipsychotics has led to a reduction in some of the metabolic effects of these drugs. In this study, HDL level was increased, and the mean systolic blood pressure and FBS were decreased in the melatonin group. Considering that these factors are contributing to cardiovascular disease as a leading cause of mortality in psychiatric patients, so the use of melatonin can reduce some of the medical effects of long-term treatment of atypical antipsychotics."

abstract = "Background
peripheral neuropathy is the most common problem of diabetes. Neuropathy leads to lower extremity somatosensory deficits and postural instability in these patients. However, there are not sufficient evidences for improving postural control in these patients.
Aim
To investigate the effects of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) on postural control in patients with diabetic neuropathy.
Methods
Twenty eighth patients with diabetic neuropathy (40–55 Y/O) participated in this RCT study. Fourteen patients in case group received TENS and sham TENS was used for control group. Force plate platform was used to extract sway velocity and COP displacement parameters for postural control evaluation.
Results
The mean sway velocity and center of pressure displacement along the mediolateral and anteroposterior axes were not significantly different between two groups after TENS application (p>0.05).
Conclusion
Application of 5min high frequency TENS on the knee joint could not improve postural control in patients with diabetic neuropathy."

abstract = "Aims
Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the major chronic vascular complication of T2DM and leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Inflammation is one of the proposed pathway which explains microvascular complications in T2DM but exact mechanism is still unclear. Omentin-1 is an anti-inﬂammatory adipokine which promotes insulin signaling. IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine having role in immune and inflammatory responses. The present study was conducted to elucidate the role of omentin-1 and IL-6 in the pathogenesis of DN and its association with insulin resistance. We aimed to assess and compare the serum levels of omentin-1 and IL-6 in T2DM patients with and without DN.
Materials & Methods
Our study comprised of 2 groups of 41 each. Group A (controls) included T2DM without nephropathy patients and group B (cases) included T2DM nephropathy patients. Parameters studied were serum omentin-1, insulin, IL-6, fasting blood glucose, urea, creatinine, lipid profile, HOMA-IR, eGFR and BMI.
Results & Conclusion
Omentin-1 (p=0.03) was significantly decreased; concomitantly, significant increase in levels of insulin (p=0.004), IL-6 (p=0.023) and HOMA-IR (p=0.0004) were found in cases compared to controls. Bivariate analysis showed eGFR correlating positively with omentin-1 and negatively with insulin in the study population. Our study results, based on serum omentin-1 and IL-6 data suggest important role played by inflammatory mechanism and insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients."

Diabetes mellitus is a major health problem in developing countries. There are various insulin therapies to manage diabetes mellitus. This systematic review evaluates various insulin therapies for management of diabetes mellitus worldwide. This review also focuses on recent developments being explored for better management of diabetes mellitus.
Research design and method
We reviewed a number of published articles from 2002 to 2016 to find out the appropriate management of diabetes mellitus. The paramount parameters of the selected studies include the insulin type & its dose, type of diabetes, duration and comparison of different insulin protocols. In addition, various newly developed approaches for insulin delivery with potential output have also been evaluated.
Results
A great variability was observed in managing diabetes mellitus through insulin therapy and the important controlling factors found for this therapy include; dose titration, duration of insulin use, type of insulin used and combination therapy of different insulin.
Conclusion
A range of research articles on current trends and recent advances in insulin has been summarized, which led us to the conclusion that multiple daily insulin injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (insulin pump) is the best method to manage diabetes mellitus. In future perspectives, development of the oral and inhalant insulin would be a tremendous breakthrough in Insulin therapy."

Better understanding risk factors for metabolic syndrome (MetS) will allow early targeted intervention to mitigate long term risk. We aim to determine the disparate impact of each individual MetS component on overall risk of developing MetS, stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, and age.
Methods
Using data from the 2003–2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), MetS prevalence among adults (age ≥18) was stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, age, and by individual MetS components (e.g. hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), waist circumference, serum high density lipoprotein (HDL), serum triglycerides (TG). Mutlivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate the disparate impact of each risk factor on MetS risk.
Results
Overall MetS prevalence was 33.3%, with the highest prevalence among older individuals, among women, and among Hispanics. When stratified by each individual component of MetS, low serum HDL was the strongest predictor of MetS risk overall and among both men and women, among all race/ethnic groups, and among all age groups (overall: OR 20.1, 95% CI 18.6–21.7). While presence of DM also increased an individual’s risk of MetS, DM was the weakest predictor of MetS.
Conclusions
Among U.S. adults, low serum HDL carries the strongest risk in predicting development of MetS. This effect was seen among men and women, among all race/ethnic groups, and among all age groups, highlighting the importance of low serum HDL as a marker of MetS risk."

To determine the association between thyroid hormones and insulin resistance in a population of healthy individuals.
Materials and methods
We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study in adults who attended a private clinic from 2012 to 2014. We excluded those participants with fasting glucose values ​​compatible with diabetes mellitus, abnormal thyroid hormone values, chronic use of corticosteroids, and incomplete medical records. Participants were divided into tertiles (low, intermediate and high) according to their free triiodothyronine and free thyroxine values. We defined Insulin resistance as a Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) value greater than 3.8. We conducted a univariate and multivariate Poisson regression model to assess the association between thyroid hormones and insulin resistance. The association measure reported was the prevalence ratio (PR) with their confidence interval (CI) at 95%.
Results
We evaluated 600 participants. The mean age was 36.8±14.2years and 33% were male. The frequency of insulin resistance was 29.5%. In the univariate regression, we found association between free triiodothyronine tertiles and insulin resistance. In the multivariate regression adjusted for age, sex, body mass index and thyroid stimulating hormone, the association between free triiodothyronine tertiles and insulin resistance remained; intermediate tertile (PR=1.54; CI95%: 1.10-2.15) and high tertile (PR=1.70; CI95%: 1.21-2.39). We found no association between T4 and insulin resistance.
Conclusions
High levels of free triiodothyronine are associated with insulin resistance. The use of free trioodothyronine to assess insulin resistance in healthy patients should be considered."

Methods
During 2001–2, we enrolled 3042 adults without CVD from the general population of Attica, Greece. In 2011–2, the 10-year study follow-up was performed, recording the CVD incidence in 1958 participants with baseline body mass index (BMI) ≥18.5kg/m2.
Results
The study 10-year CVD incidence was 15.8%, exhibiting a gradual increase according to the baseline body mass index (BMI) category. Baseline BMI ≥30kg/m2 was related with significantly higher 10-year CVD risk compared to BMI <25kg/m2, even after adjustment for age and other known CVD risk factors. Baseline BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio and waist-to-hip-to-height ratio were independently associated with the 10-year CVD risk in multi-adjusted models. Gender-specific analyses showed that these associations were more evident in men compared to women, with baseline BMI exhibiting an independent association with the 10-year CVD incidence in men.

Diabetic nephropathy traditionally produces significant proteinuria prior to the development of renal impairment. However, this clinical paradigm has recently been questioned. The current study evaluated the impact of diabetes mellitus on the prevalence of renal disease in general population.
Methodology
Data from of the HERMEX survey, an observational, cross sectional, population based study were used. The final sample included 2813 subjects (mean age 51.2 years, 53.5% female). Four hundred patients have diabetes. Urinary albumin excretion (UAE) rate was analyzed and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated using the CKD-EPI formula.
Results
Among participants without diabetes, 2.9%(2.2–3.6) had a GFR < 60 ml/min. Prevalence of abnormal UAE in population without diabetes was 3.3% (2.6–4.0). The global prevalence of renal disease was 5.6%(4.8–6.6). Prevalence of GFR <60 ml/min in subjects with diabetes was 8.8%(6.4–11.9)(p<0.001,Chi-square test). Prevalence of abnormal UAE in population with diabetes was 14.1%(7.7–19.8)(p< 0.001,Chi-square test). CKD prevalence was 20.3%(16.6–24.6)(p<0.001,Chi-square test). The logistic regression analysis showed a positive independent association of CKD with age, high blood pressure and albuminuria. No significant relationship was found with diabetes mellitus
Conclusions
CKD is more prevalent in population with diabetes. Nevertheless, most of patients with diabetes and CKD have no albuminuria. An increased cardiovascular burden seems to produce this clinical presentation."

Methods
Bipolar Disorder inpatients who were in manic episode and age-gender matched healthy controls were included in the study. CRI-I, CRI-II, AIP and AC parameters were calculated before and after treatment. The statistical significance level was accepted as p<0.05.
Results
Sixty-eight male patients and 60 healthy controls were included in the study. CRI-I, CRI-II, AIP and AC parameters showed an increase after treatment (p<0.001 for all parameters). There was no significant difference between patients and controls in terms of CRI-I and CRI-II and AC (p=0.129, p=0.573, p=0.129 respectively). Although mean AIP levels of patients was significantly lower than control group (p=0.031), the significance disappeared when we compared the patients and controls according to being in low, medium, and high risk groups (χ2=0.826, p=0.662).
Conclusions
Even in short term of treatment, antipsychotics have an important role in developing dyslipidemia and increasing cardiovascular risk. Manic state may have positive or at least no additional influences on atherogenic risk."

Though most diabetics have frequent encounters with healthcare providers and report compliant behaviors, the majority do not meet recommended diabetes management guidelines. Screening of at-risk populations, targeted SMS campaigns, or diabetes-specific training for healthcare providers may improve clinical outcomes."

abstract = "Aims
Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is an important etiologic and prognostic factor for pancreatic cancer, but few studies have assessed health outcomes among hospitalized pancreatic cancer patients. We examined the associations between MetS and in-hospital outcomes, i.e. pancreatic resection, post-surgery complications, in-hospital mortality and discharge disposition among hospitalized patients with pancreatic cancer.
Methods
Using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) dataset from 2007 to 2011, we obtained data on 47,386 patients hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Descriptive statistics and multivariable regression models were used to compute estimates, odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.
Results
Pancreatic cancer patients with MetS were more likely to undergo pancreatic resection (OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.04–1.25) compared to those without MetS. However they were less likely to experience post-surgical complications (OR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.81–0.99), discharge to a skilled nursing facility (OR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.83–0.93), and less likely to experience in-hospital mortality (OR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.44–0.61) compared to those without MetS.
Conclusion
Hospitalized pancreatic cancer patients with a clinical diagnosis of MetS were more likely to receive pancreatic resection, and had reduced odds of post-surgical complications and in-hospital mortality. If confirmed in future studies, then better understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying this association will be needed, potentially leading to the development of clinical and/or molecular biomarkers to improve early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and identify patients that may benefit from pancreatic resection."

Few studies have examined whether longitudinal changes in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), independent of each other, are associated with the risk of developing metabolic syndrome (MetS). The objective of this study was to examine the longitudinal effects of VAT and SAT on MetS and metabolic risk factors in a multi-ethnic sample of Canadians followed for 5-years.
Materials and methods
In total, 598 adults of the Multicultural Community Health Assessment Trial (M-CHAT) were included in this study. Assessments of body composition using computed tomography (CT) and metabolic risk factors were conducted at baseline, 3-, and 5-years. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to model the longitudinal effects of VAT and SAT on MetS and metabolic risk factors.
Results
There were significant between-person (cross-sectional) effects such that for every 10cm2 higher VAT, the odds of MetS, high-risk fasting glucose levels and high-risk HDL-C levels significantly increased by 16% (95% CI: 9–24%), 11% (3–20%), and 7% (0–14%) respectively. Significant within-person (longitudinal) effects were also found such that for every 10cm2 increase in VAT the odds of MetS and high-risk triglyceride levels significantly increased by 23% (9–39%) and 30% (14–48%), respectively. Cross-sectional or longitudinal changes in SAT were not associated with MetS or metabolic risk factors.
Conclusions
This study found a direct relationship between longitudinal change in VAT and MetS risk independent of changes in SAT. Clinical practice should focus on the reduction of VAT to improve cardiovascular health outcomes."

Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are both associated with the development of Type 2 Diabetes and other pathologies; however, the influence of parental history of Type 2 diabetes (PH-T2D) has yet to be investigated. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the effect of PH-T2D has on the risk of developing hyperinsulinemia and IR.
Materials and methods
1092 subjects (703 non-pregnant females and 389 males) were enrolled for a cross-sectional study. Clinical and biochemical parameters were collected. Subjects were allocated according to their PH-T2D: no parents, one parent, or both parents. Insulin resistance was calculated using the HOMA1 equation (HOMA1-IR). Logistic regression was used to determine the association (odds ratio) between PH-T2D and hyperinsulinemia or insulin resistance.
Results
Increasing degrees of PH-T2D were associated with significant increases in fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and HOMA1-IR (p <0.05). Subjects having one or both parents were associated with an increase risk of developing hyperinsulinemia (odds ratio=1.53, 95%CI: 1.12–2.09, and odds ratio=1.92, 95%CI: 1.21–3.06, respectively) and insulin resistance (odds ratio=1.47, 95%CI: 1.08-2.00 and odds ratio=1.77, 95%CI: 1.09–2.87, respectively), when adjusting for age, sex, BMI, fasting plasma glucose, and triglycerides.

Newer blood gas analyzers have the ability to report electrolyte values and glucose in addition to pH, so this diagnostic process could be condensed in diagnosing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). We aimed to assess the accuracy of the venous blood gas (VBG) analysis with electrolytes for diagnosing DKA.
Methods
This study prospectively identified a convenience sample of (60 patients) presented with DKA and tested their VBG and serum electrolytes. The diagnosis of DKA was made according to American Diabetes Association criteria. Serum chemistry electrolyte values were considered to be the criterion standard. Sensitivity and specificity of VBG electrolytes results were compared against this standard. In addition, correlation coefficients for individual electrolytes between VBG electrolytes and laboratory chemistry electrolytes were calculated.
Results
Paired VBG and serum chemistry panels were available for 60 patients, only 49 patients were included, In this study; 20% of cases were newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus. The total number of diabetic ketoacidosis was 14 patients (28.5%). The sensitivity and specificity of the VBG and electrolytes for diagnosing DKA was 92.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]=89% to 99%) and 97.1% (95% CI=92% to 100%), respectively. Correlation coefficients between VBG and serum chemistry were 0.91, 0.47, 0.61, 0.65, and 0.58 for blood sugar, sodium, potassium, chloride, and creatinine respectively.
Conclusions
Findings of this study offer preliminary support for the possibility of using VBG sample rather than VBG sample and serum chemistry electrolytes together to rule out diabetic ketoacidosis."

We studied demographic and clinical factors association with pre-stroke glycemia, indicated by glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), in acute stroke patients with T2D.
Methods
Using a questionnaire, we collected demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical information from 300 acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke patients in one hospital. We analyzed factors associated with HbA1c in patients with history of T2D.
Results
There were 111 patients with history of T2D and HbA1c measured on admission. In multivariable analyses factors associated with higher HbA1c were treatment with insulin (p=0.05), history of hyperlipidemia (p=0.01), and total cholesterol level (p=0.02). Poor adherence to T2D treatment was associated with higher HbA1c levels (p=0.006) only in a subgroup of patients with HbA1c ≥8%.

Sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) are any beverages containing added-sugar and supposed to increase body lipogenesis and fat accumulation in healthy subjects. This study was performed to assess the possible association between SSBs consumption and obesity in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients.
Methods
T2DM adults with no insulin treatment entered the study. Abdominal obesity and general adiposity were determined using waist circumference (WC) and body mass index (BMI), respectively. SSBs intake was extracted from a validated food frequency questionnaire.
Results
Mean SSBs intake was 0.6 serving/d (145.6mL/d). There was no considerable association between SSBs intake and gender. About 46% of patients consumed at least one serving of SSBs per week. SSBs consumption was correlated neither to WC nor to BMI. After adjustment for confounding factors, abdominal obesity was associated with drinking SSBs ≥1 serving/week (OR=4.93, 95% CI: 1.35–18.03), and SSB ≥3 serving/week (OR=5.07, 95% CI: 1.22–21.15) compared to those consumed <1 serving/week. This association was not found for general obesity (OR=0.88, 95% CI: 0.60–1.23). Ex-smokers had higher SSBs intake compared to those never smoked (OR=3.94, 95% CI=1.06–14.71). Energy intake and macronutrients were similar in both SSBs sub-groups. Mean daily energy supplied by SSBs was 120kcal in participants having ≥1 serving of SSBs/week and 2.7kcal in <1 serving SSBs/week (OR=1.14, 95% CI: 1.09–1.20). Lower SSBs drinkers had 17% higher fiber intake (OR=0.83, 95% CI=0.73–0.96).
Conclusion
SSBs intake might increase abdominal obesity in diabetic population and therefore should be considered in diabetes control procedure."

Forty post-menopausal women (62.48±7.67years; 154.6±5.11cm; 73.93±15.43kg; 31.13±5.82 BMI kg/m2) with a diagnosis of T2D participated in this cross-sectional study. The patients performed fasting blood sample exams, anthropometrics assessments, body composition, and clinical exams. Subjects performed physical tests including handgrip, timed up and go, 30-s chair stand, arm curl, and sit-to-stand. The correlation between the parameters of physical tests, age, body composition, vitamin D, and blood glucose was assessed by Pearson correlation.
Results
The results showed there were significant correlations between blood glucose and relative strength (R=−0.398, p=0.011), arm curl test (R=−0.367 and p=0.020), and hip flexion (R=0.427, p=0.006).
Conclusions
These findings are important because they highlight the importance of resistance training in individuals with T2D and the relationship with a fat increase during a dicrease process. Furthermore, the concentration of serum glucose might be associated with decreases in muscle strength and muscle function in older adults. Thus, T2D patients should be involved with strength training to improve the strength and the muscle hypertrophy."

Since, resistin has been associated with coronary heart disease and with the progression of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), our objective was to determine the correlation between resistin and cardiovascular risk (CVR) in subjects with increasing degrees of hyperglycemia.
Methods
Using a cross-sectional study design, the anthropometric and biochemical profiles were collected from 180 subjects from Puebla, Mexico. Subjects were separated into Normoglycemic (NGT), pre-diabetic (PT2D), or T2D. CVR was determined by the Atherosclerosis Coefficient ((total cholesterol-high-density lipoprotein)/high-density lipoprotein), Castelli 1 index (total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein), Castelli 2 index (low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein), Framingham risk score (https://www.mdcalc.com/framingham-coronary-heart-disease-risk-score#next-steps), and the CVR index (CVRI=triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein). Differences between groups were determined using ANOVA. Partial correlation assessed the association between resistin and CVR indices. Logistic regression was used to determine the risk [Odds ratio (OR)] between resistin and CVR.
Results
Serum Resistin levels were similar between NGT, PT2D, and T2D. No correlation was observed between resistin and CVR indices for the NGT and PT2D. However, T2D demonstrated a strong negative association between the Framingham (r=−0.34, p=0.01), the Castelli 1 index (r=−0.29, p<0.01), and the CVRI (r=−0.38, p<0.05), when adjusted for sex and taking treatment for T2D. For T2D, when the subjects were separated by resistin into tertiles, elevated resistin was associated with a benefit for the Castelli 1 index (T1 v T3: OR=0.15, 95% CI: 0.03–0.070) and the CVRI (T1 v T3: OR=0.13, 95% CI: 0.03–0.66).

To describe the relationship between daily physical activity (steps/day and self report method) and health indices. Also to observe relationship between daily physical activity and existence of any prior sign of metabolic syndrome in middle aged adults of 40–60 years. A secondary objective was to observe relation between objective (steps/day) and subjective (IPAQ) measure of physical activity.
Method
145 subjects were recruited from residential colony of New Delhi, India and their health indices (waist circumference, hip circumference, waist hip ratio, blood pressure, resting heart rate), and presence of any sign of metabolic syndrome were noted down. Their daily physical activity was determined by pedometer (steps/day) and IPAQ (self report). Steps/day was compared with self reported physical activity, presence of any prior sign of metabolic syndrome, and health indices.
Result
The average steps/day was 3226±1558 for females (n=76) and 4273±2530 for males (n=69). IPAQ results were inversely related with WHR (p=0.046, r=−0.166), RHR (p=0.020, r=−0.193) and signs of metabolic syndrome (p=0.017, r=−0.198).

Conclusion
Main findings suggested that fewer steps/day and METS are associated with more components of the metabolic syndrome. Prior signs of metabolic syndrome were mainly present in females.

Insulin Resistance(IR) is increasing in Africans as well as among the Human Immunodeficiency Virus(HIV) infected population for several reasons which include the viral infection itself and the use of Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). This present study assessed the prevalence of IR among HIV infected population and the imminent effect of the disease and therapy on patients.
Methods
This cross sectional study was conducted in Lagos among 266 HIV infected participants and 130 HIV Negative controls aged 18–80 years. Questionnaires were administered and fasting venous blood samples collected for plasma glucose and insulin. Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) and Quantitative Insulin Check Index (QUICKI) indices were used to establish Insulin Resistance using a cut off of >2 and <0.339 respectively.
Results
Insulin resistance was prevalent in 24.1% of HIV-infected participants based on a HOMA-IR and 21.1% using QUICKI compared to 8.5% and 4.6% in the HIV uninfected controls (p<0.001). A prevalence of 25.8% was found among the HAART exposed group compared to 10% among the HAART naïve group (p=0.056) using HOMA-IR while QUICKI results showed 22.5% and 10% respectively (p=0.115).
Conclusion
This study established a significantly high prevalence of IR among HIV infected patients and a higher but non-significant prevalence among the HAART exposed group. Close monitoring of patients is recommended to reduce the risk of developing Diabetes Mellitus. Further research work is needed to identify ways of lowering the prevalence of IR in HIV infected persons."

Autoimmune DM was diagnosed using glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65), insulin autoantibody (IAA) and islet cell antibody (ICA). Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) models of HOMA-B and HOMA- IR were used for estimation of β-cell function and IR respectively. The patients were divided into four groups based on, the autoimmunity (A) and ketosis (K) as group 1 (A+K), group 2 (A−K+), group 3 (A+K−) and group 4 (A−K−). Appropriate statistical tests +)were used to analyze the results.
Results
The study population (n=75, all males) had a mean age of 28.9±4.3years, body mass index 20.6±1.9kg/m2, fasting plasma glucose 177.1±31.4mg/dl and HbA1c of 9.9±2.1% at presentation. The number of patients in groups 1 to 4 are 8, 5, 10 and 52 respectively (p<0.0001). HOMA-IR was higher in groups 2 and 4 (4.1±1.3, 3.6±1.1 respectively), whereas HOMA-B was higher in group 4 (3.6±1.5) alone (p=0.0005).
Conclusion
Type 2 DM is the most common etiology even in young, lean adults in India. Further studies with large numbers are required to confirm our findings."

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has burdened health systems in the world to the value of 500 billion dollars/year. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4 Inhibitors) have been strongly associated with spending on the treatment of T2DM by the courts in Brazil. The aim of this study was to estimate the most cost-effective DPP-4 Inhibitor for T2DM treatment. A pharmacoeconomic study of cost-effectiveness was performed in a medium-sized municipality in Minas Gerais state, Brazil.
Methods
The data are from legalization in municipal health in 2013. The effectiveness of DPP-4 Inhibitors was measured by the reduction in glycated hemoglobin (A1c). The direct medical costs of drug and adverse drug reactions were identified. With these data, a cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) and construction of the decision tree for sensitivity analysis were performed.
Results
The representative of the most effective in reducing A1c gliptins was sitagliptin in combination with metformin, it was able to reduce A1c by 1.16% (1.09 to 1.22, CI 95%). The drug with the lowest cost was linagliptin, with a cost per patient/year of US$ 481.42. Sensitivity analysis performed by the decision tree shows that sitagliptin in association with metformin had the CER of US$ 1,506.75 per patient/year, to reduce A1c by 1%.
Conclusion
The most cost-effective DPP-4 Inhibitor was sitagliptin with metformin."

A descriptive, observational study was completed in a tertiary care hospital between November 2014 and March 2016. Fifty consecutive patients of Type 2-Diabetes Mellitus who had been on metformin therapy for at least three months were included in our study. Several Parameters were compared with vitamin B12 levels and severity of peripheral neuropathy (using Toronto Clinical Scoring System (TCSS) and Nerve Conduction Velocity). These included the duration of diabetes, duration of metformin usage, dietary history, and HbA1c levels. Definite B12 deficiency was defined as B12<150pg/ml and possible B12 deficiency as <220pg/ml.
Results
In our study, we found a negative correlation between duration of metformin use and Vitamin B12 levels(r=−0.40). The mean Vitamin B12 levels seen in our study was 212.3pg/mL. There is a positive correlation between the duration of metformin therapy and peripheral neuropathy (r=0.40). The mean TCSS score was 6.8. The percentage of patients with mild neuropathy was 28%, with moderate neuropathy was 20% and severe neuropathy in 12% of the patients. The average duration of metformin use in patients without peripheral neuropathy was 5.5yrs whereas the average length of metformin use in patients with peripheral neuropathy was 10.4 yrs.
Conclusion
Patients on long-term metformin therapy are at a high risk for Vitamin B12 deficiency and peripheral neuropathy. Interval Screening for peripheral neuropathy is recommended for patients on metformin even if Vitamin B12 levels appear to be normal."

Obesity is regulated by different metabolic factors like leptin, adiponectin insulin and neuropeptide orexin-A. The aim of this study is to assess the role of these hormones and their interrelationship with obesity in north Indian women.
Method
A total of 168 obese women with Body Mass Index (BMI)>30kg/m2 and 150 lean women (BMI<25kg/m2) as control were recruited in this study. Women with obesity were further subdivided into two groups according to their BMI, 71 overweight women with the BMI 25–29.9kg/m2 (mean±S.D: 27.87±0.71) and the 97 obese women with BMI>30kg/m2 (34.68±1.90). Orexin −A, leptin and adiponectin were estimated using quantitative sandwich enzyme linked immunoassay and insulin was estimated by using an immuno-radiometric assay.
Result
Orexin −A and adiponectin level were significantly lower however, leptin and inulin level were significantly higher in obese women as compared with control group. Further, the one- way group analysis showed that the orexin −A and adiponectin level were significantly lower but leptin and insulin level was significantly higher in obese women as compared to overweight and control group respectively.
Conclusion
Result showed that the level of adiponectin, leptin, orexin-A and insulin play an important role in the regulation of energy expenditure. In obesity, the activity of these peptides is disturbed."

To describe the prevalence of metabolic syndrome among older adults in Ecuador. A secondary objective was to examine the relationship between metabolic syndrome and its components and insulin resistance among non-diabetic participants.
Materials and methods
The National Survey of Health, Wellbeing, and Aging survey was used to examine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome according to demographic, behavioral, and health characteristics of the participants. Logistic regression models adjusted for covariates were used to examine the independent association of metabolic syndrome and its components and insulin resistance in non-diabetic older adults.
Results
Of 2298 participants with a mean age of 71.6 (SD 8.1) years, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 66.0% (95% CI, 62.6%, 69.3%) in women and 47.1% (95% CI, 43.2%, 50.9) in men. However, even higher prevalence rates were seen among literate individuals, residents from urban areas of the coastal and Andes Mountains region, obese subjects, those diagnosed with diabetes, and participants with≥2 comorbidities. Overall, abdominal obesity followed by elevated blood pressure were the metabolic syndrome components more prevalent and associated with insulin resistance among older Ecuadorians. Moreover, after adjustment for covariates, older adults defined as having metabolic syndrome had a 3-fold higher odds of having insulin resistance as compared with those without.
Conclusions
The prevalence of metabolic syndrome is high among older adults in Ecuador. The present findings may assist public health authorities to implement programs of lifestyle and behavioral modification targeting older adults at increased risk for this cardio metabolic disorder."

Demographics, anthropometric indices (BMI: Body mass index; WC: Waist circumference, WHR: Waist hip ratio, WHtR: Waist-to-height Ratio), Mets: and Then oxidative stress markers (total antioxidant capacity; TAC, Malondialdehyde; MDA, serum superoxide dismutase; SOD, catalase; Cat) were measured. All analyses were performed at a significant level of 0.05, using the SPSS Statistics 21 and Stata 12 software.
Result
The mean age of the participants was 41.4±7.8years. the mean values of different anthropometric indices in patients with metabolic syndrome were higher than those in subjects without MetS and this difference was significant. According to ROC curve the best marker for diagnosis of Mets was WHtR (Waist-to-height Ratio) and its cut off point was 0.54.Also, there was a positive correlation between WHtR and MDA serum levels. In addition, there was a negative correlation between WHtR and the levels of TAC, SOD, and CAT but it was not significant.
Conclusions
It seems that WHtR can be a valuable marker for predicting metabolic disorders and related diseases; moreover, it can be used for evaluation of oxidative stress level. Finally, the formula WC=height×0.54 as a simple tool for prevention of metabolic diseases can be used in university personnel."

To study the loss of diurnal variation in blood pressure in normotensive patients with Subclinical/overt hypothyroidism and effect of Levothyroxine (L-T4) treatment.
Materials and methods
In this interventional study Eighty patients between 17- 50 years with newly detected OH and SCH (74 women and 6 men) and nine euthyroid subjects (all men) with blood pressure <140/90 were recruited. All patients underwent 24h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) using ABPM machine before and after treatment with L-T4. Diurnal index (DI), Percent time elevation (PTE), Hyperbaric impact (HBI) were studied pre and post L-T4 treatment.
Results
Of the 89 subjects (22 SCH, 58 OH and 9 controls), 7 of the SCH and 30 of OH subjects reported back in follow up after L-T4 supplementation for evaluation. DI, HBI and PTE when compared at baseline between different groups (SCH- OH, SCH- control, OH- control) were insignificant. After L-T4 supplementation DI, HBI and PTE varied significantly with p value 0.007, 0.003 and 0.003 respectively between SCH- OH only. Post L-T4 analysis in SCH group was statistically insignificant (p-value 0.102) but a trend toward improvement in DI was noted (baseline and post treatment DI mean 7.00 and 13.00 respectively).
Conclusion
Loss of nocturnal dipping was found in patients with OH and SCH which was restored after L-T4 therapy only in patients with SCH and not with OH.
Treatment
of SCH patients with high cardiovascular risk may be beneficial in this setting and can be a new indication for LT4 therapy in SCH."

To determine the progression rates from metabolically healthy or unhealthy normal weight, overweight and obese phenotype to type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a non-diabetic high risk population in Isfahan, Iran.
Methods
T2D incidence during a mean (SD) follow-up of 10.1 (2.3) years was examined among 1,982 non-diabetic first-degree relatives (FDR) of patients with T2D 30–70 years old. Participants were divided into 6 groups based on body mass index and metabolic syndrome component, except waist circumference, at baseline: metabolically healthy normal weight (MHNW), metabolically healthy overweight (MHOW), metabolically healthy obese (MHO), metabolically unhealthy normal weight (MUNW), metabolically unhealthy overweight (MUOW) and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO).
Results
The MHO, MUOW, and MUO individuals at baseline were associated with incidence of T2D, independently of age and gender. MHO were 3 times (OR 2.96; 95% CI 1.07, 8.24) and MUOW were 2.75 times (95% CI 1.17, 6.45) more likely to develop T2D than those with MHNW. There was excess risk in MUO than MHO (OR 3.86; 95% CI 1.64, 9.11).
Conclusions
Obesity was a risk factor for T2D, even in the absence of any metabolic abnormalities. Metabolic abnormalities were a stronger predictor of incident T2D than obesity."

Observational studies evaluating the association between chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) have yielded inconclusive results.
Objective
The current meta-analysis was conducted to identify whether CHB infection plays a role in the risk of MetS and its components.
Methods
The electronic search of MEDLINE, PubMed Central, and EMBASE databases was systematically performed from their inception until February 2017 to identify all eligible studies. The most adjusted risk estimates and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations of chronic hepatitis B with MetS and its components were collected and analyzed.
Results
A total of 13 studies, with a total sample size of 138,994,999 subjects and 35,481,231 individuals with MetS were included in this Meta-analysis. The results of pooled analysis revealed that CHB infection is related to reduced risk of MetS (OR=0.83, 95%CI=0.71–0.79, random effects), with evidence of significant heterogeneity (I2=89%, P<0.001). This association was an age, gender, and ethnicity-dependent relationship. Moreover, CHB was associated with reduced risk of elevated blood pressure, reduced HDL-cholesterol, increased fasting glucose, and, most strongly with increased triglycerides in some subgroups. The sensitivity analyses confirmed the stability of the results.
Conclusions
This meta-analysis suggests that CHB is associated with decreased risk of MetS and some of its single components."

To assess the association between elevated serum ferritin levels and the presence of insulin resistance (IR) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in a population of individuals with no endocrine or metabolic disorders background.
Methods
Analytical cross-sectional study, carried out in adults of both sexes with no medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or other metabolic or endocrine disorder, who attended the outpatient service of a private clinic in Lima-Peru during 2012–2014 period. Impaired serum ferritin levels were defined as serum ferritin values >300μg/L in men and >200μg/L in women. IR was defined as a Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) value ≥3.8 and IGT was defined as an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) value between 126mg/dL and 199mg/dL. The reported association measure was the prevalence ratio (PR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
Results
We analyzed 213 participants, the average age was 35.8±11.1years and 35.7% were males. The prevalence of impaired serum ferritin levels, IR and IGT in the population was 12.7%, 33.3% and 9.9% respectively. In the adjusted Poisson regression models, the prevalence of IR was higher among the group with impaired serum ferritin levels (PR=1.74; 95%CI:1.18–2.56); however, we found no association between impaired serum ferritin levels and IGT (PR=1.42; 95%CI:0.47–4.30).
Conclusions
Impaired levels of serum ferritin are associated with IR, nevertheless, not with IGT in a metabolically healthy population. Serum ferritin could be considered as an early marker of IR prior to the onset of glycaemia disorders."

This work aims to identify correlations between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) based on creatinine and/or cystatin C (Cr, CysC) with metabolic syndrome (MS) components in young adults, according to gender.
Material and methods
This is a cross sectional study, where young adults aged between 18 and 30 were matched by gender, age and body mass index. All subjects underwent clinical evaluation and blood sampling for laboratory measurements. MS was determined according to the JIS criteria. The eGFR was estimated using CKD-EPI equations (eGFRCr; eGFRCysC; eGFRCr-CysC).
Results
We evaluated 78 subjects with a mean age of 24.5 years. 10.2% had MS, with higher incidence among males (15.4% ♂ vs. 5.1% ♀). Elevated waist circumference was the MS component most observed. Significant correlations (Pearson; p<0.05) between eGFR and metabolic markers were observed only in males. In addition, we observed a significant association between the increase of MS components and the decay of eGFRCr and eGFRCr-CysC (zero vs. two or more components, ANOVA, p<0.05) only among males.
Conclusion
eGFR decay associated with components of MS and insulin resistance in young male adults could represent a worrying specific risk and indicate that further studies are needed to better understand these findings."

Comorbidity of non-communicable diseases carries a significant risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. With the rising burden of diabetes, hypertension and other risk factors, and ageing population in India, this is likely to pose a major threat to the health system. It is therefore essential to understand this high risk group. This article reports prevalence of comorbid diabetes and hypertension and its associated risk factors in the North Indian state of Punjab.
Methods
A household NCD STEPS survey was done in Punjab, India in a multistage stratified sample of 5127 individuals. All the subjects were administered the WHO STEPS questionnaire, anthropometric and blood pressure measurements. Every alternate respondent in the sample (n=2499) were assayed for blood glucose and lipid parameters.
Results
The prevalence of comorbid DM and HTN was 4.5% in the general adult population. DM, HTN and dyslipidemia co-existed in 1.8% of the population. Obesity and dyslipidemia are the most common comorbidities among persons with DM and HTN alone and comorbid DM and HTN. Factors strongly associated with comorbid DM and HTN include elderly age group, dyslipidemia, obesity and family history of DM.
Conclusions
The study reported high burden of comorbid diabetes and hypertension among the elderly, strongly associated with obesity and dyslipidemia. This emphasizes the role of nonpharmacological intervention such as weight reduction, physical activity, and dietary modification."

Data collected using pretested designed questionnaire based on previously validated Global Physical Activity Questionnaire. The demographic and physical measurement including blood glucose, anthropometric and blood pressure.
Results
The Mean age of participants was 35.5. Males were 59.9% and females 47.1% and the prevalence of inactivity was 53.8%. Despite the fact that males are more active than females (P<0.000) physical activity tends to decrease with age but this not statistically significant. Physical activity is significantly decreased with obesity, higher education and doing sedentary jobs (P<0.018, P<0.000 and P<0.000 respectively). While majority of individuals with hypertension and pre-hypertension tend to do less physical activity (P<0.045 and P<0.008 respectively). Logistic regression analysis shown that gender is absolute risk factor for physical activity. Males have more than three times probability of being physically active than women OR3.82 (1.91–7.30). In this study, physical activity was not affected by central obesity (P<0.497), diabetes (P<0.378) and being married or not (P<0.135).
Conclusion
Physical activity in Sudanese women was significantly decreased in comparison with men."

abstract = "Background
Arterial stiffness is a principal cardiovascular risk factor. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a predisposing factor to arterial stiffness and persistent MetS circumstances can deteriorate the arterial stiffness severity. Low concentrations of plasma ghrelin are meticulously connected to arterial stiffness. This work targeted to judge the relationship between plasma ghrelin levels and intima-media thickness (IMT) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) as markers of arterial stiffness and inflammatory markers and in Saudi subjects with MetS.
Patients and methods
Eighty-four young adults were recruited from the visitors of the outpatient clinics of Taif hospitals, and then they were divided into a control group that involves subjects without MetS and a study group involving those with MetS. Anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, plasma ghrelin levels, fasting plasma glucose levels (FPG) and lipid profile were assessed. baPWV was measured by a volume plethysmograph while IMT was evaluated by ultrasonography.
Results
Plasma ghrelin values were significantly (P<0.001) decreased in the MetS group versus control group. Arterial stiffness was noticed in MetS group by significantly (P<0.01) increased IMT and baPWV (P<0.001) matched with control group. Plasma ghrelin concentrations were negatively associated with age, smoking, FPG, HbA1c, CRP, TNF-alpha, baPWV, and Lt Carotid IMT.
Conclusions
Depending on our outcomes showing the valuable properties of ghrelin in the cardiovascular system in patients with metabolic syndrome, it can be postulated that ghrelin may be associated with markers of atherosclerosis."

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by insufficient insulin production or ineffective pancreatic secretions. In Ghana, the prevalence of DM was estimated to be 6.3% amongst men and women older than 30 years living in the Greater Accra region. The disease can be determined by various means including the use of the multistix that assesses the presence of glucose in urine.
Materials and methods
In this study, 100 subjects were sampled made up of 65% males and 35% females whose urine samples were verified using multistix.
Results
Most (63%) of the subjects diagnosed with the disease fell within the age ranges of 60–69 years and 70–79 years, thus establishing the fact that the incidence of the disease increases with increasing age and increasing body mass index (BMI) over above 25kg/m2. Some (44%) had a family history of diabetes. Other factors such as the socioeconomic status (SES) categories, physical activity levels and eating habits of the respondents played different roles in the occurrence of the disease.
Conclusion
The sex of the individual, however, did not have a major impact on the occurrence of the disease. This study confirmed that overweight body (BMI≥25kg/m2) especially of older ages above 50 years of have very strong link with the prevalence of diabetes mellitus."

This review examined whether maternal and paternal periconceptional nutrition effects an offspring's likelihood of developing chronic metabolic related conditions due to epigenetic imprinting.
Methods
A literature search was conducted in multiple science databases and limited to studies published after 2012, in English language and peer reviewed. The data from selected articles were extracted and a qualitative approach was employed due to heterogeneity of results.
Results
Newborns from obese fathers showed altered methylation overall and significant hypomethylation at the Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 (IGF2) gene. High maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) was associated with altered offspring DNA methylation levels and gestational diabetes mellitus induced significantly increased methylation levels in offspring. Gestational weight gain was not associated with differentially methylated cord blood. Birth weight was higher in offspring exposed to famine in early gestation. Offspring born post maternal bariatric surgery showed a lower percentage of body fat and improved fasting insulin levels compared to siblings born pre-maternal bariatric surgery.
Conclusions
The available evidence suggests that poor maternal and paternal periconceptional nutrition can increase the risk of metabolic syndrome in offspring, through epigenetic imprinting. Potential parents should be advised that maintaining a healthy diet and BMI is likely to reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome in offspring."

To describe the prevalence of abdominal obesity and its association with cardio metabolic risk factors among older adults in Ecuador.
Materials and methods
The present study used data from the National Survey of Health, Wellbeing, and Aging survey to examine the prevalence of abdominal obesity according to certain demographic, behavioral, and health characteristics of the participants. Logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders were used to evaluate the association of abdominal obesity with cardio metabolic risk factors.
Results
Of 2053 participants aged 60 years and older, the prevalence of abdominal obesity was 65.9% (95% CI; 62.2%, 69.4%) in women and 16.3% (95% CI; 13.8%, 19.2%) in men. Notably, a higher prevalence of abdominal obesity was seen among residents in the urban areas of the country, those who reported their race as black or mulatto, individuals with sedentary lifestyle and obesity, and older adults with greater number of comorbidities. Moreover, after adjustment for potential confounders, women with abdominal obesity were 2.0, 2.8, and 1.6 times more likely to have diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, and hypertriglyceridemia as compared with those without, respectively. Likewise, men with abdominal obesity had 51% and 22% higher rates of hypertension and diabetes than their non-obese counterparts, respectively.
Conclusions
the prevalence of abdominal obesity is high among older adults in Ecuador. Moreover, abdominal obesity is significantly associated with cardio metabolic risk factors. Therefore, further research is needed to evaluate sociodemographic and nutritional determinants of this emerging public health burden among older Ecuadorians."

There is evidence that rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients have an over-risk of cardiovascular disease. This may be mainly due to an increase in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS). The prevalence of MetS among adults in Algeria is 19.1%.
Objectives
The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of MetS among RA patients in Algeria. Another aim was to evaluate the relationship between MetS, inflammation biomarkers and disease scores.
Methods
The study was performed on a cohort of 249 patients meeting the ACR/EULAR criteria for RA, followed in 11 Algerian centers. The diagnosis of MetS was based on the NCEP/ATP III (MetS+ if ≥3/5) definition. Prevalence of MetS was calculated, and patients were divided in two groups (MetS+ and MetS-). Comparison between the groups was performed using a t-test.
Results
Among the 249 RA patients, 213 were females and 36 males of a mean age of 50.1±14.5years and a mean disease duration of 8.4±7.8years. The overall prevalence of MetS was 13.9% (CI95%: 9.5-20.1%); it was 14.3% in males and 13.8% in females. The ESR level was significantly higher in MetS+ patients than in MetS- patients (p=0.036).
Conclusion
In this multicenter study, unlike most studies on RA patients, the prevalence of MetS was as not higher in Algerian RA patients (13.9%) than in the Algerian general population (19.1%). Only ESR levels correlate with the presence of MetS, this may be due to the modest cohort size and needs to be confirmed."

Prospective study that included all patients submitted to elective colorectal cancer surgery between August 2015 and August 2016 at Hospital de Braga. Clinical and laboratory parameters evaluated pre-operatively were: central obesity, blood pressure, fasting glucose, triglycerides levels and HDL cholesterol levels. Any complications during the first 30-days after surgery were recorded (readmission, reintervention, anastomotic dehiscence, morbimortality).
Results
One hundred and thirty-four patients were included. Metabolic syndrome was diagnostic in 40.7% of patients with the ATPIII definition, 67.5% with the AHA definition and 67.0% with the IDF definition. At 30days after colorectal cancer surgery, 73.1% patients don’t have any complication, 15.7% have minor complications (grade I/II of Clavien-Dindo classification), 11.1% have major complications (grade III/IV/V of Clavien-Dindo classification) and 1.5% have died from surgical complications (grade V of Clavien-Dindo classification). The statistic analysis didn’t reveal any association between MS, or it’s different components, and surgical outcomes.

Methods
A total of 120 individuals participated in this cross sectional study: 60 patients with schizophrenia (26 males and 34 females) and 60 patients with bipolar I disorder (32 males and 28 females). The psychological disorders were diagnosed by some experienced psychiatrists according to the DSM-V. Furthermore, metabolic syndrome was diagnosed according to ATP III guidelines.
Results
Metabolic syndrome prevalence among schizophrenic and bipolar I patients was 28 and 36 percent, respectively; the disparity in prevalence is not significant. According to the results, compared to their male counterparts, females were more prone significant to metabolic syndrome. Moreover, diastolic blood pressure was significantly higher among bipolar I patients. On the other hand, schizophrenic males were observed to have higher fasting blood sugar levels in comparison to bipolar I males patients. Age, consumption of second generation antipsychotics or antidepressants, and the duration of the disorder were found to be related to metabolic syndrome.
Conclusion
This study showed that metabolic syndrome is not more prevalent among bipolar I patients, compared to those with schizophrenia. Also, women are more likely to be affected by the syndrome. A number of factors such as age, consumption of medication, and duration of the disorder are associated with the likelihood of the syndrome."

Results
The total study sample included 75 subjects. The average age (SD) was 48.2 (5.6) years, and the mean duration of diabetes (SD) was 6.2 (2.4) years. The most common type of extrasystoles were the single supraventricular extrasystoles, observed in 72.29% of cases (vs 38.89% in the control group) and paired supraventricular extrasystoles, which were identified in 30% of cases (vs 19.44% in the control group). Ventricular cardiac arrhythmias in the form of ventricular extrasystoles (VE) were identified in 25.71% of cases (13.89% in the control group).
Conclusions
This study revealed the signs of the morphological restructuring of the right chambers of the heart and a relatively high prevalence of supraventricular arrhythmias in the early stages of type 2 diabetes. Moreover, according to the results, the incidence of some types of supraventricular arrhythmias and the occurrence of tachycardia episodes in patients with type 2 diabetes mostly depends on the restructuring of the right chambers of the heart, which may be caused by the peculiarities of the cardiac innervation, with the higher density of choline and adrenergic plexuses in the right chambers."

54% of individuals were categorized as high risk followed by 37.6% as moderate risk as per IDRS risk score. Prevalence of diabetes was more in ≥50years age group (28.6%) as compared to 35–49 years (14.2%) and 20–35 years age group (6.0%). Individuals with no physical activity had significantly high prevalence of diabetes as compared to mild or moderate physical activity (P 0.004). Similarly, males with waist circumference ≥100cm and females with ≥90cm had significantly high prevalence of diabetes (P 0.000 and P 0.005). On multiple logistic regression analysis age, family history of diabetes and BMI were independent predictors of diabetes.
Conclusion
Diabetes is a rising epidemic. Early screening and appropriate interventions at the start are needed for control of disease and risk factor modifications."

To study the effect of short term Yoga-based lifestyle intervention in the management of diabetes and pre-diabetes, through a ‘pilot’ community-based study.
Methods
A total of 1292 subjects with diagnosed type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes were recruited from different States of India viz., Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Tamilnadu participated in the study. Yoga-based lifestyle intervention was introduced through 10-day non-residential camps. Baseline and post intervention assessments of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) were measured on the first day and tenth day respectively. Of 1292 subjects, 896 both pre- and post- FPG readings were available. Data analysis was done using statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS), version 16.
Results
Mean baseline FPG level was 133.1 (±47.98) and the mean post intervention FPG reduced to 121.19 (±40.56). There was a statistically significant decrease in FPG, p value (<0.0001).
Conclusion
The result suggests that a short-term Yoga-based lifestyle intervention effectively reduces FPG levels in type 2 diabetes patients and pre-diabetes."

We aimed to investigate the association of eating meals while television viewing (TVV) and screen-based behaviors with cardio metabolic risk factors (CRFs) among school-aged children in Shiraz.
Materials and methods
This cross-sectional study was done on 409 primary school children (217 boys), aged 6–9 years. Physical activity, time spent on screen-based behaviors and frequency of eating meals while TVV were measured using a questionnaire. Anthropometric indices, fasting blood sugar (FBS), blood lipids, blood pressure (BP), dietary intakes and physical activity were assessed. Association of eating while TVV with CRFs were assessed using linear regression, adjusted for potential confounders. All statistical analysis were conducted using the Stata 13 software.
Results
Fully adjusted model showed that TVV time had significant positive association with waist circumferences (WC), and BP (p <0.05). Also, we found an inverse relationship between using Computer and Video games with TG level (β=−0.3; CI: −0.64, −0.09). Children who ate two or more breakfast meal while TVV had higher WC (β=2.02; CI: 0.51, 3.53) and FBS (β=3.58; CI: 0.39, 6.78) compared to who never ate breakfast while TVV. After adjustment for Screen time and BMI, eating snacks while TVV was positively associated with FBS and systolic BP. However, Eating dinner and lunch while TVV were not significantly associated with any of CRFs after adjustment for confounders.
Conclusions
We found that both eating breakfast and snacks while TVV were associated with WC, FBS and BP in children. Also, excessive TVV was associated with WC and BP."

To determine the levels of serum homocysteine and its association with insulin resistance among T2DM patients at Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital, Ile Ife Nigeria.
Methods
It was a cross sectional study. It involved consecutive recruitment of 100 T2DM subjects with 100 age and sex matched controls. The fasting plasma glucose, serum creatinine, fasting lipid profile, glycosylated haemoglobin levels, fasting serum insulin and plasma homocysteine concentration were done. Insulin resistance was also determined. SPSS version 17.0 was used for data analysis.
Results
The mean age of subjects was not significantly different from controls. (58.9±8.3 vs. 59.0±8.3years, p=0.926 respectively). Mean Homocysteine level (tHcy) was significantly higher among T2DM subjects compared to controls (27.4±12.1 and 8.3±3.2μmol/L respectively, p=0.0001). Hyperhomocystinaemia was commoner among diabetic subjects compared with controls (81% vs. 5%, p<0.0001). T2DM with hyperhomocystinaemia were more likely to have poorer glucose control profile using glycated haemoglobin (7.4±1.9 vs 6.4±1.4%, p=0.04) and fasting blood glucose 8.6±2.2 vs 7.5±2.4mmol/L p=0.047 and insulin resistance (4.4±4.3 vs. 2.0±0.6, p=0.02) compared with T2DM with normohomocystenaemia. There were significant associations between hyperhomocystinaemic T2DM patients and IR, HbA1c, TC, TG and LDL cholesterol.
Conclusion
The study showed higher homocysteine levels in T2DM than controls. Homocysteine level is worsened by increasing insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia and poor glucose control. Homocysteine level is a potential cardiovascular risk marker in type 2 diabetic mellitus subjects."

A healthy individual, with proper glucose regulation has an ability to switch between burning fat and carbohydrates. It has been suggested that signaling errors within this homeostatic system, characterized by impaired switching of substrate oxidation from glucose to fat in response to insulin, can contribute to the etiology of metabolic syndrome and occurs before the development of type II diabetes. Glucose regulation with restored insulin sensitivity facilitated through clinically regulated, benign dietary ketosis (BDK), may significantly reduce, regulate and reverse the adverse pathologies common to MetS and obesity. The study assessed if prolonged maintenance of induced and controlled physiological, dietary ketosis, would reverse pathological processes induced by MetS including a reduction in fasting triglycerides, BMI (body mass index) and body fat mass (BFM), weight, a significant decrease and/or normalization of hemoglobin A1c (HgA1c) and an increase in resting metabolic rate (RMR) and blood ketones. A group of 30 adults, previously diagnosed with MetS by their primary care physician, were randomly prescribed to one of three groups: a sustained ketogenic diet with no exercise, standard American diet (SAD) with no exercise or SAD with 3-5 days per week of exercise (30 min.). The results demonstrated that the change over time from week 0 to week 10 was significant (p=0.001) in the ketogenic group for weight, body fat percentage, BMI, HgA1c and ketones.

Recent studies have shown increasing prevalence of dysglycemia in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. The present study was planned to study the prevalence of pre-diabetes and diabetes in RA patients from a tertiary care centre in Haryana, India.
Methods
150 diagnosed cases of rheumatoid arthritis which were on follow up in Rheumatology clinic from last one year and equal number of age, sex matched controls were recruited for the study. FPG, 2h plasma glucose level after 75g oral glucose tolerance test and HbA1c were estimated in all the subjects. In RA patients c-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), rheumatoid factor (RF) and Anti-cyclic citrullinated (Anti CCP) antibodies were also measured and disease activity was assessed by using (DAS28 joint counts) and CDAI.
Results
Patients with RA had statistically significant higher waist circumference, hip circumference and BMI as compared to control group. Prevalence of glucose intolerance in RA patients and control group was 14.67% and 6.67% respectively which was statistically significant (p=0.025). The prevalence of pre-diabetes was in RA group was not significant statistically. There was higher disease activity in glucose intolerant (GI) RA cases as compared to normal glucose tolerant (NGT) RA cases. The most commonly used drug combination among RA patients was MTX+HCQ+SAAZ (49 patients, 32.67%). Maximum glucose intolerance was observed in patients who were on Non-HCQ drug combinations.
Conclusions
There is elevated prevalence of glucose intolerance among RA patients that is related to high disease activity, visceral adiposity and drugs usage."

Metabolic syndrome is highly prevalent among patients with type II diabetes and is reported as a strong risk factor for cardiovascular diseases as well as carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The aim of the current study was to compare median nerve indices among diabetic patients with and without metabolic syndrome.
Methods
This cross-sectional study was conducted on 105 patients with type II diabetes whom participated in the coronary artery disease risk factor study in Kerman, Iran (KERCARDS). Patients with type II diabetes were called and those with clinical symptoms of CTS were included in the study, and median nerve indices were measured according to standard electro diagnosis tests. GEE statistical model was used to compare median nerve indices among diabetic patients with and without metabolic syndrome. All statistical analysis was done using SPSS 20.0.
Results
The mean age of participants was 57.57±9.53. There was no significant difference between the left and right hand regarding median nerve indices except median nerve motor amplitude (MA). Furthermore, components of metabolic syndrome including BMI and LDL were determined as risk factors for CTS according to several indices.
Conclusion
Components of metabolic syndrome had more influence on sensory indices than motor indices and primary control of these components might prevent dysfunction of sensory neurons and also motor neurons in advanced stages among diabetic patients."

abstract = "Aim
Chronic kidney disease related-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) has been poorly studied in pre-dialysis Indian CKD population. There are limited data on the pattern of these disturbances in diabetic CKD patients. Therefore, a study was conducted to find out the profile of mineral bone disorders in T2DM patients with pre-dialysis CKD.
Methods
In this cross-sectional design, diabetic patients with newly-diagnosed stage 4 and 5 CKD were evaluated. Serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), 25 hydroxy vitamin D and total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were measured in all patients. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).
Results
A total of 72 eligible patients participated (44 males, 28 females; age 54.2±11.7). Patients with CKD Stage 5 had a lower level of corrected serum calcium and significantly higher level of inorganic phosphorus, total ALP and iPTH as compared to stage 4 patients. Overall, 38.5% were hypocalcemic, 31.43% were hyperphosphatemic. 24.2% of CKD subjects were vitamin D deficient (<10ng/ml) and 41.4% having vitamin D insufficiency (10–20ng/ml). In stage 4, hyperparathyroidism (iPTH>110pg/ml) was detected in nearly 43% of patients. In stage 5, only 32% patients was found to have hyperparathyroidism (iPTH>300pg/ml). There was a good correlation between iPTH and total ALP (r=0.5, p=0.0001) in this cohort. 25 (OH) vitamin D was inversely correlated with ALP (r=−0.39, P=0.001) and showed negative correlation with urine ACR (r=−0.37, P=0.002). As a group, the osteoporotic CKD subjects exhibited higher iPTH (220.1±153.8 vs. 119±108pg/ml, p<0.05) as compared to those who were osteopenic or had normal bone density. There was significant correlation between BMD and iPTH (adjusted r=−0.436; P=0.001). In the multivariate regression model, we found intact PTH to predict BMD even after adjustment of all the confounders.
Conclusion
The current study showed that adynamic bone disease is prevalent even in pre-dialysis CKD population. High bone turnover disease may not be the most prevalent type in diabetic CKD. However, it could contribute to the development of osteoporosis in CKD subjects. Serum total ALP can serve as a biochemical marker to identify pattern of bone turnover where intact PTH is not available."

Methodology
Case group included 40 first-degree relatives of ischemic stroke patients between 30 and 50 years of age. Forty age and gender matched apparently healthy subjects without major risk factors were recruited as controls. Their blood samples were analysed for routine biochemical parameters, Fasting Insulin, high sensitivity C-reactive protein and Homocysteine.
Results
First-degree relatives showed dyslipidemia (High total cholesterol, elevated Low Density Lipoprotein and elevated Non-High Density Lipoprotein), hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance compared to controls. They had high levels of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (p=0.045). There was positive correlation between fasting insulin and Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance with high sensitivity C-reactive protein among first-degree relatives.
Conclusion
First-degree relatives of ischemic stroke patients exhibited hyperinsulinemia, Insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Insulin resistance, a low grade inflammatory state that leads to increased C-reactive protein which triggers the development of atherosclerosis. So screening for insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in first-degree relatives of ischemic stroke patients may help in preventing adverse vascular events."

Aim
To study the relation between endogenous sex hormones and MetS among Egyptian males.
Subjects and method
For the study, 80 Egyptian males were enrolled: 40 males with MetS and 40 healthy age-matched males. Anthropometric measurements and blood pressure were taken for both groups. FBG, TC, HDL-C, TG, testosterone, and E2 levels were determined; LDL-C was calculated.
Results
Males with MetS had significantly lower testosterone levels and significantly higher E2 levels compared to those without MetS (p value 0.0001). The lowest quartile of testosterone was most prevalent among males with MetS (19/40 males, 47.5%) compared to those without MetS (0/40 males, 0%, p value 0.011). Estradiol in the third quartile was most prevalent among males with MetS (19/40 males, 47.5%) compared to those without MetS (1/40 males, 2.5%, p value 0.0001). Serum testosterone and E2 levels were independent predictors of MetS with optimum cut off value (≤2.37ng/ml) for testosterone and (>16.78pg/ml) for E2.
Conclusion
Endogenous testosterone and estradiol are independently associated with MetS with potential utility as predictors of MetS."

The intervention group members and a friend or a family member, that could be supportive in physical activity, received teaching CD based on health promotion model. Both group members at the beginning of the study, two weeks and three months after the training, completed questionnaires. After data collection, statistical analysis was conducted using independent T-test, chi-square test, and repeated measurement of ANOVA.
Results
Finding showed that self-efficacy (P<0.001), health status (p=0.032), benefits (P<0.001) and friends support in physical activity (P<0.001) were perceived to be higher, and barrier of physical activity (P<0.001) was perceived to be lower in multimedia group compared to control group 3 months after training. There was a significant difference in average of metabolic equivalent of task (MET) between two groups after the intervention (P<0.001).
Conclusion
Planning of education based on the HPM and implementation through multimedia can change belief about physical activity and increase participation in physical activity."

Type 2 DM is rapidly rising as a global health care problem that threatens to reach pandemic levels by 2030. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a disease with no cure and chronic disease that results in major morbidity and mortality. The main objective of this study is to evaluate postprandial plasma glucose level and to determine factors affect on postprandial plasma glucose level among type 2 diabetes outpatients attending endocrinology clinics at Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, Teaching Hospital.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The study design was observational prospective longitudinal follow-up study, the study was conducted with sample of 1077 type 2 diabetes mellitus outpatient recruited via attended the diabetes clinics at Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia (HUSM) in Kelantan. Post prandial plasma glucose (PPG) parameter to measure the glycaemic control. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the independent variables that affect the PPG control.
RESULTS
About 426 (39.6%) of the patients did not achieve the optimal postprandial plasma glucose level (<10mmol/l). In this study, the possible factors that affect postprandial plasma glucose levels (PPG) were found to be gender (OR=0.77) and the duration of diabetes (OR=1.12).
CONCLUSION
It has been found that gender and the duration of diabetes are the factors affecting PPG. New strategy to improve the current status of control of diabetes is needed. The study recommends that health-care providers should pay more attention to type 2 DM male patients and patients who had diabetic for long time."

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new class of antidiabetic drugs that affect serum electrolytes levels. The aim of this review is the detailed presentation of the associated mechanisms of the SGLT2 inhibitors-induced electrolyte abnormalities.
Materials and methods
Eligible trials and relevant articles published in PubMed (last search in July 2017) are included in the review.
Results
SGLT2 inhibitors induce small increases in serum concentrations of magnesium, potassium and phosphate. The small increase in serum phosphate concentration may result in reduced bone density and increased risk of bone fractures, mainly seen with canagliflozin, but recent meta-analyses did not show increased risk of bone fractures with SGLT2 inhibitors.
Conclusion
The increases in serum electrolytes levels may play a role in the cardiovascular protection that has been recently reported with empagliflozin and canagliflozin."

Hypomagnesaemia has been shown to be associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its complications. The present study investigated the association of hypomagnesaemia with T2DM and its complications in patients hailed mostly from the western hilly region of Nepal.
Methods
This study was conducted among 150 type 2 diabetic patients and 150 of non-diabetic controls between May to September 2016. Relevant demographic, anthropometric, physiological and biochemical variables were measured using standard protocols. Statistical analyses were performed by SPSS version 17.0.
Results
Hypomagnesaemia (1.7±0.2mg/dl) was present in 50% of diabetic patients and none in the healthy controls (2.0±0.2mg/dl). It was inversely correlated with levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (r=−0.299), total cholesterol (r=−0.219), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (r=−0.168) and creatinine (r=−0.215) and directly correlated with serum creatinine based glomerular filtration rate (eGFRcr) (r=0.196). Subjects with hypomagnesaemia were significantly older (57.4±11.5years) and had higher levels of HbA1c (8.4±1.2%) and serum total cholesterol (248.3±72.0mg/dl). The methods of diabetes control did not have a significant influence on serum magnesium level. Patient’s age (OR: 1.05 (95% CI-1.01–1.09)), poor glycemic control (OR: 6.78 (95% CI-2.56–17.95)) and low eGFRcr (OR: 4.89 (95% CI-1.78–13.40)) were the significant predictors of hypomagnesaemia.
Conclusion
Half of type 2 diabetic population under study had hypomagnesaemia without regard to the method of diabetes control. Old age, poor glycemic control, and low eGFRcr were the significant predictors of low serum magnesium in these patients. Besides their regular anti-diabetic treatment, clinicians should also consider dietary supplementation of magnesium to prevent further complications of diabetes in these patients."

abstract = "Objective
Metabolic syndrome is a constellation of risk factors with increased predilection towards occurrence of cardiovascular diseases. Currently physical exercise and management with metformin are the prevailing treatment modalities for metabolic syndrome. Patients with metabolic syndrome have been found to have reduced exercise capacity over a period of time. Likewise metformin has been shown to decrease exercise capacity among healthy volunteers. Hence this study aims to evaluate the effect of metformin on the exercise capacity of patients with metabolic syndrome.
Design
Prospective study with 6 weeks follow up.
Methods
Newly diagnosed patients with metabolic syndrome and to be started on Table Metformin 500mg twice a day were recruited for the study after obtaining written informed consent. Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET) was done at baseline before the subjects were started on metformin and after 6 weeks of treatment using cardiopulmonary exercise testing apparatus (ZAN600).
Results
Fifteen treatment naïve patients with metabolic syndrome completed six weeks of therapy with metformin. In these patients oxygen uptake [VO2] showed statistically significant decrease from 1.10±0.44 at baseline to 0.9±0.39 (l/min) after six weeks of treatment with metformin [mean difference of −0.20 (−0.31 to −0.09); P=0.001]. Similarly oxygen uptake/kg body weight [VO2/Kg] showed a significant decrease from 14.10±4.73 to 11.44±3.81 (mlkg−1min−1) at the end of six weeks of treatment [mean difference of −2.66 (−4.06 to −1.26); P=0.001].
Conclusion
Six weeks of treatment with metformin significantly decreases exercise capacity in newly diagnosed patients with metabolic syndrome."

Findings will provide evidence-based data for neighboring countries to aid in combat of this epidemic.
Method
A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Malta (2014–2016) on a randomized adults population sample. Various components of MetS were measured along with lifestyle habits (smoking, alcohol and physical activity) and family history (cardiovascular and diabetes). Both descriptive and statistical analyses were performed.
Results
A total of 80,788 Maltese adults estimated to suffer from MetS. Males were predominantly affected with significant difference from females. All MetS components were found to be significant predictors along with alcohol habits but not smoking. Neither physical inactivity nor family history of cardiovascular disease, showed any predictive ability for MetS even after adjustment. Elevated triglyceride levels exhibited highest predictive effect on MetS. TG/HDL ratio showed predictive ability in the Maltese population.
Conclusions
Males were at higher risk for MetS in Malta. A number of predictors were established but not sedentary lifestyle. TG/HDL ratio may provide to be a good indicator for development of MetS."

Chronic inflammation plays a central role in the development and progression of diabetes, and in the pathogenesis of its complications. The neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet–lymphocyte ratio (PLR) are indicators of subclinical inflammation. Mean platelet volume (MPV) is one of the platelet function indices. We investigated the association of NLR, PLR and MPV with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus and determine whether or not these are reliable markers for diagnosis.
Materials and methods
Participants were divided into four groups; 1: normal glucose tolerance, 2: impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetic), 3: newly diagnosed diabetic by OGTT. 4: group is previously diagnosed diabetic without complication. Outcomes were compared between groups.
Results
There are significant differences between all groups in NLR (p=0.004) and PLR (p=0.021) values. NLR values are significantly higher in prediabetic (1.60±0.85), firstly diagnosed diabetic (1.58±0.78) and clear diabetic (2.07±0.95) groups compared to normal group (1.37±0.69) (mean, SD). PLR values are significantly lower in prediabetic (90.35±44.34) and firstly diagnosed diabetic (86.38±45.24) groups compared to normal group (100.55±48.14) but significantly higher in clear diabetic group (122.45±37.43). There are no significant differences between all groups in MPV values.
Conclusion
Inflammation marker NLR significantly increases in prediabetic and diabetic patients. PLR significantly decreases in prediabetes and early stages of diabetes but increases in later stages. NLR and PLR values may be reliable predictive markers in prediabetes and diabetes mellitus."

Metabolic syndrome increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes. This review is on the associations between MetS and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF induces migration and proliferation of endothelial cells (ECs), increases vascular permeability and has a role in tumor growth, adipose tissue expansion, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Circulating levels of VEGFs are elevated in obese individuals and it has also been suggested that VEGF is secreted from adipose tissues, especially from intra-abdominal adipose tissue. There is abundant evidence to support that poor glycemic control in diabetic patients is associated with increased plasma VEGF, which in turn may cause hypertension and several vascular complications in diabetic patients. Circulating VEGF levels are increased in children and young adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus and middle-aged diabetic patients with proliferative retinopathy. It has been revealed that plasma VEGF increases in patients with hyperlipidemia and may trigger the development of atherosclerosis. It can be concluded that there is a positive association between VEGF and components of MetS. Because of the importance of this relationship, more investigations are needed in this field."

Understanding the metabolic syndrome has been the center of attention in recent years as a major risk factor of many diseases. Given the rising incidence of this disease and as the patient can compete against this disease with choosing healthy lifestyle, in the present study, we investigated the predictors of metabolic syndrome, based on Walker’s health-promoting lifestyle in two large cities in Iran, in 2016.
Methods
This cross-sectional study used two-stage cluster sampling to select 1128 patients, among patients who referred to health centers in Isfahan and Yazd. Data were gathered by Walker lifestyle questionnaire that evaluates health-promoting behavior (nutrition, physical activity, health responsibility, spiritual growth, interpersonal relations, and stress management) by self-report that were completed by interviews for illiterate and semi-literate individuals. Data analysis was performed by SPSS statistical software.
Results
In this study, 576 women and 454 men participated with mean age of 56.19±12.11years and mean weight of 73.90±14.45kg.
Results
showed that the highest mean score for different health-promoting behaviors was related to social responsibility (25.53±5.65) and the lowest was related to nutritional status (15.18±5.79). Regarding the strongest predictor of lifestyle, the results of regression analysis showed that the most direct impact was related to stress management (R2=0.343) and the least direct impact was related to social responsibility (R2=0.243). Among the structures, physical activity with overall effect of R2=0.621 was the strongest predictor of lifestyle based on Walker’s pattern.
Conclusion
Considering the results of this study, the greater emphasis in planning and interventions to reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome should be spotted on physical activity and stress management in patients with the metabolic syndrome."

Raised blood pressure is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide; improved nutritional approaches to population-wide prevention are required.We aimed to investigate the relationship between dietary intake and other cardiovascular risk factors with blood pressure in individuals without a history of a cardiovascular event in an Iranian cohort.
Material and method
A cross-sectional study of 5670 healthy subjects [approximately 40% (n=2179) males and 60% (n=3491) females] was undertaken in a sample from northeastern Iran. Subjects were recruited from an urban population, using a stratified-cluster method and derived from the Mashhad Stroke Heart Atherosclerosis Disorder (MASHAD) study, Mashhad, Iran. The age of the subjects was between 35 and 64 years. None of the subjects had a past history of major disease.
Results
The mean ages for the male and female subgroups were 50.1± 8.1years and 48.2 ±7.8 y respectively. Not unexpectedly, subjects without hypertension (HTN) were younger than those with established HTN. Individuals with HTN were significantly more adipose than those without (p<0.01). We found no significant differences in crude or total energy adjusted intake of nutrients between the three groups (p>0.05), except for crude and energy adjusted phosphorus intake (p<0.05) and crude intake of the cholesterol (p<0.05). There was a significant correlation between the dietary intake of total fatty acids, phosphorus and vitamin E with both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). PUFA (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval (CI)], 1.56 [1.05–1.06]; P<0.01), sodium (OR [95% CI], 1.00 [(1.00–1.01)]; P<0.01) and phosphorus (OR [95% CI], 1.00 [(1.00–1.01)]; P<0.01)were significant independent predictors of HTN after adjustment for energy intake.
Conclusion
In our representative population from North-Eastern Iran, it appears that in adults without a history of cardiovascular disease, crude or energy adjusted intake of phosphorus and total fatty acid intake were significant determinants of BP, however we found no association between sodium and potassium intake with BP."

Triacylglycerol/High density lipoprotein (TAG/HDL) ratio, a surrogate marker of LDL particle size (small dense) was included in our study to observe the link with insulin resistance and thyroid co-morbidity.
Methods
Ninety three patients with T2DM of both genders were enrolled from a tertiary health care unit in Puducherry, during the latter half of 2015. The cardio-metabolic risk factors were assessed through body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, fasting blood glucose and lipid profile, glycated haemoglobin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Serum free T4, T3 and TSH were also measured to evaluate the thyroid co-morbidity as a function of insulin resistance.
Results
In addition to insulin resistance, results of our study were focussed on thyroid comorbidity. In overweight diabetic patients, the ROC curve analyses demonstrated that the best marker for insulin resistance was Triacylglycerol/High density lipoprotein (TAG/HDL), with the area under the ROC curve being 0.902. Thyroxine (T4) was less significant when compared to TAG/HDL with area under the ROC curve of 0.583. Triiodothyronine (T3) and T4 were more significant in obese group with areas under the curve being 0.842 and 0.816 respectively when compared against insulin resistance (cut-off value for HOMA-IR 2.69). The optimal cut-off points for overweight were: TAG≥101mg/dl; T4≥1.16ng/dl; TAG/HDL≥2.26 whereas for obese: TC≥163.5mg/dl; TAG≥141.5mg/dl; T3≥2.42pg/ml; T4≥0.96ng/ml.
Conclusions
In overweight type 2 diabetics, TAG/HDL ratio could be used as a reliable marker for insulin resistance with thyroid co-morbidity and T3, T4 were better objective markers in obese type 2 diabetics."

Metabolic syndrome increases cardiovascular risk, and causes damage to the vascular wall. Through this mechanism, it might increase arterial rigidity, leading to further complications and heart strain. The use of a device that measures arterial rigidity can help determine if metabolic syndrome is related to a higher vascular stiffness and changes in estimated arterial age.
Methodology
Cross-sectional study at Luis Vernaza hospital of Guayaquil, Ecuador. Inpatients and outpatients from the Department of Cardiology with a full blood panel and echocardiogram were included. We used the IDF criteria to diagnose metabolic syndrome and measured arterial rigidity parameters in all of them, including augmentation indexes, central blood pressure, pulse wave velocity and arterial age.
Results
95 patients were included for analysis, 44.2% were females and 55.8% were males. Mean age was 61.7 years (±13.1). Metabolic syndrome was diagnosed in 49.5% of our patients and it was significantly more prevalent in women. We found significant differences in PWV, augmentation indexes, and peripheral and central blood pressure between metabolic and non-metabolic syndrome patients. There was a non-significant relationship between estimated arterial age and metabolic syndrome (p=0.32).
Conclusion
Patients with metabolic syndrome have an increased arterial rigidity. This, added to the high prevalence of the disease we found in our sample, shows the high cardiovascular risk these patients are at. A multidisciplinary approach to management is needed, along with patient collaboration. The introduction of these devices to measure arterial stiffness in developing countries can improve diagnosis and therapy of patients with cardio-metabolic conditions."

The relationship between thyroid function and lipid profile has been documented in T2DM and healthy subjects. The aim of the current study was to assess the association between thyroid hormone parameters and dyslipidemia in T2DM and non-diabetic study participants.
Method and materials
In this comparative cross-sectional study, 214 type 2 diabetic and 214 non-diabetic study participants were enrolled. Clinical and anthropometric data were collected from all study participants. After overnight fasting, 10ml of whole blood samples were drawn for the measurement of serum TSH, free thyroxine (fT4), free triiodothyronine (fT3), serum reactive C-protein levels, as well as for lipid profile test and glucose.
Result
The burden of hypothyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism among T2DM study participants were 73 (17.05%) and 13 (3.04%) respectively. Comparatively, T2DM study participants had significantly higher serum lipid level than non-diabetics. Stratified by TSH, hypothyroid T2DM study participants had increased lipid level than euthyroid subjects. T2DM serum TSH have shown a positive significant correlation with all lipid profile parameters except HDL-C. In the final model (multivariate linear regression), diabetics serum TSH significantly and positively associated with TG and BMI. Diabetic serum fT3 and fT4 negatively associated with body mass index. In addition, diabetics serum fT3 negatively and serum fT4 positively associated with TC and HDL-C respectively.
Conclusion
T2DM study subjects had significantly higher lipid level than nondiabetic and We identified that TSH was positively associated with serum TG and BMI among T2DM study participants."

The efficacy of insulin therapy in diabetes depends on proper storage and injection technique. The purpose of this study was to assess the practice of insulin administration among diabetes patients in a tertiary care center.
Materials and methods
This observational study was done in Endocrinology department of a tertiary care center during April–June 2015. The consecutive patients using insulin for at least three months by either syringe or pen were recruited. All of them underwent a survey by the questionnaire which focused on key insulin injection parameters.
Results
One hundred and sixty eight (74.67%) patients were storing insulin vials properly. The thigh was the most common site of insulin injection and 209(92.89%) study participants were rotating at the injection sites. Only 48.57% (34/70) subjects were mixing insulin properly before injection. The practice of hand washing and the cleaning of the injection site was practiced by 158(70%) & 171(76.44%) subjects respectively. One hundred and fifty six (69%) patients were injecting with the proper skin fold and 123(55%) subjects were injecting insulin at 90° angle. The majority of patients (91%) were throwing the needle and syringes directly into the garbage and public drainage system.
Conclusions
There was a significant gap between the insulin administration guidelines and current insulin injection practice. The diabetic education and counseling about proper insulin injection techniques should be provided to all diabetic subjects."

To examine the influence of ethnicity and glucose tolerance status on subjective sensations and food intake in overweight/obese Asian and European Australians.
Methods
18 Asians and 26 Europids were classified as normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) based on serial measures of finger-prick glucose following an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Subjective sensations of hunger and satiety were measured before and every 15min after the OGTT using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Food intake was measured covertly from consumption of a buffet style lunch and from self-maintained 24h food records. All serial measurements were converted into total area under the curve (TAUC) and comparisons adjusted for age, fat and fat-free mass.
Results
There was a significant difference interaction between ethnicity (ETH) and glucose tolerance (GTT) for subjective fullness, desire for food and prospective food intake. IGT Asians had significantly greater sensations of fullness, but lesser prospective food and desire to eat, as compared to other groups. However there were no differences in calorie and macronutrient intake at buffet lunch or over 24-h.
Conclusion
Interactions between ethnicity and glucose tolerance status in subjective sensations did not transcribe to differences in prospective food intake."

Diabetes is a common problem in older adults, as they increasingly comprise a larger proportion of patients newly diagnosed with diabetes. The evidence on the prevalence and distribution of type 2 diabetes (DT2) and its related factors among older adults in Iran is sparse. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of DT2 among Iranian older adults aged ≥60years.
Materials and methods
The study was part of a comprehensive survey (Urban HEART-2) which was a large population-based cross-sectional study. A multistage cluster random sampling method was used to select the participants in Tehran in 2011. All the participants were interviewed by trained personnel using a standard questionnaire on diabetes as well as a socio-demographic checklist. Logistic regression and chi-square were used to investigate the association between diabetes and the demographic characteristics.
Results
A total of 15069 older adults were included in this analysis. The mean age of the participants was 68.93±7.27years (SE: 0.059) and the mean of BMI was 26.21±4.40kg/m2 (SE: 0.036). Prevalence of DT2 was 14.4% among Iranian older adults. Factors such as age, being female, high BMI, and education were significantly associated with DT2.
Conclusion
Given the high prevalence of diabetes among older people, more population based research is needed to quantify the ramifications of diabetes, and to monitor the effects of prevention and health system strengthening strategies on the prevalence, treatment, and control of DT2."

The objective of the study was to compare the diagnosis of dysglycemic states by conventional oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) criteria (fasting and 2-h plasma glucose) with the 1-h post-load plasma glucose level.
Material and methods
34 individuals (mean age: 55±13years; BMI: 27.7±6.3kg/m2) at risk for prediabetes were administered a 75g OGTT. Individuals with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) or prediabetes were identified according to fasting and/or 2-h plasma glucose (PG) concentrations. Subsequently, subjects were divided in 2 groups: group 1 (n=21) with a 1-h PG<155mg/dl and group 2 (n=13) with a 1-h PG≥155mg/dl. HOMA was performed to assess β-cell function and insulin sensitivity.
Results
NGT or prediabetes based on conventional criteria correlated with the 1-h PG<or≥155mg/dl (p<0.001). Moreover, the 1-h PG≥155mg/dl was associated with higher HbA1c levels (6.1±0.5 vs. 5.5±0.3%, p<0.001) and significantly impaired insulin secretion and hyperbolic product (BxS) on HOMA test vs. 1-h PG<155mg/dl.

This pilot study aimed to investigate and compare the perceived pain relief effectiveness of two different modes of TENS in people with painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN).
Methods
A cross-over study was conducted at Charles Sturt University, Orange. Five participants with PDN were assessed with a McGill Pain Questionnaire before and after each of the two TENS treatments. Participants were randomly allocated to Traditional TENS (80Hz, 200ms) or Acupuncture-like TENS (2Hz, 200ms) and the treatments were applied daily for 30min over ten days. Following a seven day washout period, the alternate mode of TENS was carried out using the same method. Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests were used to statistically analyse the results.
Results
All five participants reported personally meaningful pain relief during one or both of the TENS treatments. The Wilcoxon signed rank testing showed no statistical significance, p=1, likely due to the small sample size. Acupuncture-like TENS had a large effect size (z=−1.625, r=0.514), whilst Traditional TENS produced a medium effect size (z=−1.214, r=0.384). No adverse effects were reported.
Conclusion
Acupuncture-like TENS may be more effective for PDN than traditional TENS. A larger scale replication of this pilot study is warranted."

Results
There were 1378 subjects sampled, mean age 45.5±13years and 1001 (72.6%) women. The age standardised prevalence for MetS was 39.9% and significantly higher (p<0.001) in women (49.9% versus 35.0% in men). The MetS was identified in 6.9% of young adults (15–24 years), with a four-fold increase in the 25–34year olds, and 60.1% in the 55–64year old group. Clustering of MetS components was present in all age-groups, but increased with advancing age. The independent contributors to the MetS were increased waist circumference, raised triglycerides and obesity. This study highlights the high prevalence of MetS in this ethnic group and the emergence of MetS in our younger subjects.

abstract = "Background
Metabolic syndrome (MetS) was shown to be related to a variety of diseases. High level of vigilance for the diagnosis of MetS is expected among health providers. We evaluated the level of awareness to MetS among physician and nurses working in a central hospital.
Methods and results
A specially designed anonymous questionnaire was used, including both open and multiple choice questions set to evaluate the participant's awareness to MetS. The study included 126 participants, 71% physicians and 29% nurses. Mean age was 36.2±3.8 years. Among physicians, 68.5% were residents and 45.5% were internists. 98% of the participants stated that they were familiar with the term MetS and that they treat MetS patients regularly. Most participants knew the correct number of criteria included in MetS definition and the number of criteria needed for MetS diagnosis (84% and 90%, respectively). However, only 12% were able to discriminate correctly all MetS cases from non-MetS ones. Physicians performed better than nurses (15.6% and 3.1%, respectively, P=0.003). Neither, field of practice nor seniority was found to have a significant influence on the results. The frequency of recommendation for MetS risk factor modulation in the discharge files was also analyzed. Such recommendations were scarcely given, with cardiology department being the exception (80% of discharge files from cardiology department compared with less than 20% in other departments).
Conclusion
Though hospital workers showed high level of awareness to the existence of MetS, they failed to differentiate correctly MetS cases from non-MetS ones."

The increasing availability of antiretroviral drugs has made HIV-positive patients to live longer, and conditions that are associated with longevity such as metabolic syndrome and other cardiovascular related conditions have become relevant in them. This is less well studied among African populations. Therefore the study aimed at estimating and comparing the prevalence of and associated risk factors for the metabolic syndrome (MS) among African HIV infected patients.
Method
In this comparative cross-sectional study, we analyzed the data of 300 participants matched for age and gender who satisfied the inclusion criteria with half of the subjects on HAART, while the other half was HAART naïve. The MS was diagnosed using ATP-III criteria.
Results
The mean age of the patients was 34.8±9.9years. The majority of the patients were females 64%. The prevalence of MS among HAART-exposed patients was found to be 19.3%, while it was 5.3% among HAART naïve patients (p=0.001). Raised triglyceride and elevated blood pressure were the criteria with the highest occurrence among HAART-exposed, 82.8% for each. Advanced age, longer duration of HIV diagnosis and HAART exposure, increased BMI, weight gain after HAART exposure, exposure to PIs and increased mean CD4 cell count were found to be significantly associated with MS (p<0.05). However, only age (OR 4.3, 95% CI 1.6-11.8, p=0.005) and BMI (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.5-11.9, p=0.007) were found to be independently associated with the development of MS.
Conclusion
Exposure to HAART particularly protease inhibitor based regimen increases the risk of MS among HIV-infected patients."

Due to the presence of insulin resistance, PCOS increases the risk of chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes, hypertension, lipid disorders, cardiovascular diseases and malignancies such as breast and endometrial cancer. The actual cause of this syndrome is unknown but environmental factors such as dietary habits play an important role in prevention and treatment and lifestyle modifications are the most important therapeutic strategies in these patients. The approach of the diet therapy in these patients must be to reach specific goals such as improving insulin resistance, metabolic and reproductive functions that will be possible through the design of low-calorie diet to achieve weight loss or maintaining a healthy weight, limit the intake of simple sugars and refined carbohydrates and intake foods with a low glycemic index, reduction of saturated and trans fatty acids and attention to possible deficiencies such as vitamin D, chromium and omega-3. Given the prevalence of overweight and obesity and insulin resistance, a relatively low reduction in weight, about 5%, can improve problems such as insulin resistance, high levels of androgens, reproductive system dysfunctions and fertility in these women."

Materials methods
This study included 76 patients with type2 diabetes mellitus and 76 healthy subjects. The chitotriosidase activity of all serum samples were determined by fluorometric method.
Results and conclusion
The chitotriosidase activity of patients having complications (neuropathy or nephropathy) were statistically significantly higher (p<0.05) than those of the controls. When the chitotriosidase activity of patients was evaluated regarding their glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, a progressive increase in chitotriosidase activity was observed in patients. The chitotriosidase activity of patients having higher HbA1c>10% levels was statistically significant higher than those of the control group's (p<0.05).

The aim was to investigate relationships of Vitamin D receptor gene (VDR) polymorphisms to the components of MetS among Arabs adult residing in the United Arab Emirates.
Methods
A cross-sectional study of 198 Arabs adult (50 males and 148 females). Serum levels of glucose, vitamin D, HDL-C, and TG, and blood pressure were measured. FokI, BsmI & TaqI genotyping of VDR were investigated using PCR-RFLP technique.
Results
Age of the participants was 21(9) years with a BMI of 26.8(7.8) kg/m2. About 15% had MetS with serum vitamin D levels of 25.5(18.2) nmol/L. VDR genotyping yielded: FokI: 57.1% FF and 38.9% Ff, BsmI: 29.8% bb and 51.5% Bb, while TaqI showed 39.4% TT and 43.4% Tt. The ff carriers had higher total cholesterol [174(12.4) mg/dl] than FF and Ff genotypes. Bb carriers showed higher BMI and LDL-C than BB and bb genotypes. In females, FokI VDR polymorphism showed significant association with systolic blood pressure (SBP) and F allele carriers were at higher risk of developing high SBP [x2=4.4, df1, OR=0.29 (95%CI: 0.087–0.98), p=0.035].
Conclusion
VDR gene polymorphisms were not associated with MetS, yet it may affect the severity of some of components of MetS, namely the association of BsmI with obesity, FokI and BsmI with dyslipidemia and FokI with SBP."

Metabolic syndrome is a combination of insulin resistance, impaired glucose regulation, dyslipidemia, hypertension, microalbuminuria and obesity and this increases the risk for diabetes, myocardial infarction and thus increases the risk of mortality. Substance dependence is considered as a prominent risk factor for metabolic syndrome, but not much work has been done in this field. Thus this study is aimed to know the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in drug naïve substance users.
Materials and methods
A total of 50 consecutive indoor drug naive patients with substance dependence (as per ICD 10) were included. Metabolic syndrome was assessed as per WHO criteria for metabolic syndrome. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 17.0 software and Chi square test was applied.
Results
Of the 50 subjects (46% used alcohol; 26% used opioid and 28% were multiple substance users), a total of 20% of the subjects met the WHO criteria for metabolic syndrome and all of them were only alcoholics. Commonest abnormalities were low HDL (48%), raised SBP/DBP (26%/22%) and TG’s (18%). Age, weight, height, DBP and BMI were significant predictors of metabolic syndrome.
Conclusion
Metabolic syndrome is a common entity seen in patients with substance abuse, especially in patients with alcohol use disorder, as seen in our study."

abstract = "Background
The purpose of this study is to summarise the empirical evidence addressing diabetes microvascular complications and management. The effects of diabetes mellitus include long–term damage, dysfunction and failure of various organs. Microvascular disease tends to occur predominantly in tissues where glucose uptake is independent of insulin activity because these tissues are exposed to glucose levels that correlate very closely with blood glucose levels. These metabolic injuries cause altered blood flow and changes in endothelial permeability, extravascular protein deposition and coagulation resulting in organ dysfunction which in turn lead to microvascular complications.
Method
A systematic search of the literature from 2000 to 2016 was conducted using four databases (Medline, Pubmed, Cochrane central and Google scholar) using search terms such as diabetic microvascular complications’, pathogenesis, screening, risk factors, pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions and management.
Results
The current evidence supports a direct relationship between blood pressure (BP) and glycaemic control and progression of nephropathy and retinopathy. These are now considered as independent risk factors for microvascular disease progression. New fields of research addressing new drugs as potential therapeutic targets of the future will be presented.
Conclusion
The prevention of microvascular disease involves paying attention to aggravating risk factors and implementing screening programmes to improve early detection."

The clustering of components of metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a major concern in a transition population because of dramatic changing toward modern life styles. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of clustering of various combinations of MetS and its association with obesity.
Methods and subjects
In a population- based cross-sectional study, a representative samples of 1000 adults were recruited in Babol, the north of Iran. The demographic data, blood pressure, body mass index and waist circumference (WC) were measured with standard method. Fasting blood sugar, serum levels of triglycerides, high density lipoprotein were measured with enzymatic method.
Results
A quarter of population had only one component of MetS. The prevalence of just two components was 30.7% and 26.2% in men and women respectively and about 67.1% of men and 73.3% of women had ≥2 risk factors (P=0.001). While the joint prevalence of three and four components was 22.0% and 12.0% in male and 27.3% and 16.5% in female respectively. The combination of high WC with any of other four components of MetS were significantly higher compared with any other joint combinations in particularly among women (P=0.001). The adjusted odds ratio for having clustering (≥2 risk factors) increased 5.6 times (95%CI: 2.15, 6.04) in obese subjects and remained at significant level after adjustment for age, sex, level of education.
Conclusion
An emerging high rate of clustering of joint combination of cardio metabolic risk factors highlights an urgent intervention for life style modification in public health management."

This study aimed to determine the predictors of diabetes self-care in the elderly in Kerman based on a social cognitive theory.
Material and methods
In this cross-sectional study, 384 elderly diabetic patients who had referred to health screening centers in Kerman were chosen via cluster sampling. To collect information about self-care and its predictors, Toobert Glasgow's diabetes self-efficacy scale as well as a questionnaire was used which was based on social cognitive theory constructs. The validity and reliability of the questionnaire was confirmed. The data were analyzed using Pearson correlation and linear regression analysis in SPSS software 17.
Findings
Among the subjects, 67.37% (252) had poor self-care ability; 29.14% (109) had average ability, and 3.40% (13) enjoyed a proper level of self- care ability. There was a significant relationship between the constructs of the social cognitive theory (knowledge, self- efficacy, social support, outcome expectations, outcome expectancy and self-regulation) and the self-care score. Furthermore, the mentioned constructs could predict 0.47% of the variance of the self-care behaviors.
Conclusion
self-care behaviors in this study were poor. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an educational intervention based on cognitive theory constructs with the goal of properly managing diabetes in the elderly patients."

Numerous studies have assessed the association between Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, results have been conflicting due to variability in definitions of NAFLD and ascertainment of CVD, often combining clinical and surrogate endpoints. We therefore systematically reviewed published literature to assess the association between NAFLD and clinical cardiovascular events (CVE) and performed a meta-analysis.
Methods
We searched PubMed, Medline, Cochrane, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases using terms “nonalcoholic fatty liver disease”, “nonalcoholic steatohepatitis”, “cardiovascular disease”, and their combinations to identify prospective studies published from inception through March 2016. Data from selected studies was extracted and meta-analysis was then performed using random effects model.
Results
A total of six studies with 25,837 patients (NAFLD: 5953; controls: 19,884) were included in the final analysis. Patients with NAFLD had a significantly higher risk of clinical CVE compared to controls (RR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.26–2.48, p<0.001). Exclusion sensitivity analysis did not alter the above results. The association remained consistent for subgroups with clinical coronary artery disease (RR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.04–4.92, p<0.001) and ischemic stroke (RR: 2.09; 95% CI: 1.46–2.98, p<0.001). The risk of cardiovascular mortality was also increased in the NAFLD group (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.31–1.64, p<0.001).

abstract = "Aim
As diabetes mellitus is multi-factorial disease, use of several oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs) is the main stay of pharmacological treatment. The treatment has become more challenging and controversial as OHAs are heterogeneous in their mode of action that causes unwanted side effects. Complementary approaches such as use of medicinal plants and dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) with hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic activities are therefore imperative. A vast literature has independently documented the effects of OHAs, medicinal plants and PUFA for management of diabetes. In the present article, we have reviewed the current literature to describe the effects of commonly used OHAs, their mechanisms of action and reported controversies. The antidiabetic potential of herbs and/or formulations and omega-3 PUFA with its potential benefits and mode of action is also discussed.
Methods
PUBMED, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library etc., were searched for relevant articles using appropriate terms (until February 2015). Human and animal studies were selected for the review. Data extraction was carried out by one author and checked by second author.
Results
There is still controversy over the safety profile of OHAs. Medicinal herbs with hypoglycemic activities are increasingly sought because of its natural origin, active constituents and minimal side effects. The current literature suggests that supplementation with PUFA improves macro- and microvascular complications.
Conclusion
There is a need for best possible individualized treatment based on variations in biochemical parameters with combinational therapy of nutritional/herbal supplementations. Such a combination may be helpful for better management of diabetes and its complications."

There is no consensus as to which Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) definition to use for South-American populations. The aim of this study is to compare the prevalence of MetS and abdominal obesity using different criteria in Andean adults aged 40 and older living permanently at high altitude.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional study in Chivay (Andean highlands). 237 participants were included. Anthropometric measurements, glucose and lipid assessments were done in all subjects. Adult Treatment Panel III (ATPIII) and International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria for MetS were used. Abdominal obesity prevalence was determined using the American Diabetes Association (ADA), IDF, and PREVENCION Study criteria. Cohen’s Kappa coefficient (κ) was analyzed to assess agreement level between different criteria. Multiple regression analyses were performed to find predictors for waist circumference.
Results
MetS was identified in 28.7% (95%CI=23.8–33.5) using ATPIII criteria, and 37.9% (95%CI=32.7–43.0) using IDF criteria, with higher prevalence in women. The κ statistics for agreement between both criteria was 0.775 (95%CI=0.690–0.859). Abdominal obesity prevalence according to ADA, IDF, and PREVENCION criteria was 35.9% (95%CI=29.7–42.0), 75.9% (95%CI=70.5–81.4), and 42.6% (95%CI=36.3–49.0), respectively. Agreement between ADA and PREVENCION criteria was highest (κ=0.859, 95%CI=0.792–0.925). The strongest predictors for higher waist circumference values were triglycerides and BMI in women, and systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose, and HDL-cholesterol in men.
Conclusions
MetS according to ATP III and IDF criteria was highly prevalent. IDF criteria identified a larger number of subjects with MetS. Different abdominal obesity criteria tended to show variation when applied to our sample population."

abstract = "Aims
Occurrence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is rising steadily, with subsequent increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recent studies have shown that PCSK9 plays a substantial role in atherogenic dyslipidemia. Hence, the aim of this study was to assess level of PCSK9 and its relationship with MetS components among young adult females.
Methods
This study was carried out on 137 adult females over 18 years of age residing in the UAE. Subjects were categorized into two groups according to waist circumferences (WC): normal (<80cm; n=41) and large (≥80cm; n=96). Anthropometric and biochemical parameters in the fasting state (glucose, insulin, lipid profile, and PCSK9) were determined using conventional techniques. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and MetS scores were calculated as appropriate.
Results
PCSK9 was lower in subjects with large WC compared to normal WC (p=0.016). PCSK9 correlated negatively with measures of obesity (p<0.05), and positively with IR (r=0.425, p<0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the strongest predictor of PCSK9 was IR (B=6.213; p<0.001), followed by WC (B=−2.488; p<0.001) and triglycerides (B=0.897; p=0.013).
Conclusion
Results from this study demonstrate that PCSK9 correlates with some components of metabolic syndrome and central obesity in young females. Such findings support the suggestion of using PCSK9 inhibitors in the management of MetS to modify risk for development of CVD."

abstract = "The role of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) as modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) disease is increasingly debated, notwithstanding the finding that small-dense and dysfunctional HDL are associated with the metabolic syndrome and T2DM. In order to better clarify the epidemiological risk related to HDL of different size/density, without resorting to direct measures, it would seem appropriate to adjust HDL-C to the level of its main apolipoprotein (apoA-I), thereby providing an [HDL-C/apoA-I] ratio. The latter allows not only to estimate an average size for HDLs, but also to derive indices on particle number, cholesterol load, and density. So far, the potential usefulness of this ratio in diabetes is barely addressed. To this end, we sorted 488 male patients with T2DM according to [HDL-C/apoA-I] quartiles (Q), to determine how the ratio relates to cardiometabolic risk, β-cell function, glycaemic control, and micro- and macrovascular complications. Five lipid parameters were derived from the combined determination of HDL-C and apoA-I, namely HDL size; particle number; cholesterol load/particle; apoA-I/particle; and particle density. An unfavorable cardiometabolic profile characterized patients from QI and QII, in which HDLs were pro-atherogenic, denser and apoA-I-depleted. By contrast, QIII patients had an [HDL-C/apoA-I] ratio close to that of non-diabetic controls. QIV patients had better than average HDL size and composition, and in those patients whose [HDL-C/apoA-I] ratio was above normal, a more favorable phenotype was observed regarding lifestyle, anthropometry, metabolic comorbidities, insulin sensitivity, MetS score/severity, glycaemic control, and target-organ damage pregalence in small or large vessels. In conclusion, [HDL-C/apoA-I] and the resulting indices of HDL composition and functionality predict macrovascular risk and β-cell function decline, as well as overall microangiopathic risk, suggesting that this ratio could serve both in cardiometabolic assessment and as biomarker of vascular complications."

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus develop many complications including osteopenia, which is associated with high fracture risk. Osteocalcin is a non collagenous protein derived from the osteoblasts. Recently, it was found that osteocalcin enhances the pancreatic beta cell proliferation, insulin secretion and protection against type 2 diabetes.
Objective
Investigation of the association of serum osteocalcin and other bone turnover markers with blood glucose level and diabetes mellitus duration in type 2 diabetic patients.
Subjects and methods
Twenty diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients together with 20 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Serum osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium concentrations were measured by commercial ELISA kits.
Results
The results showed that type 2 diabetic patients exhibited a significantly lower serum osteocalcin and calcium (p=0.0001 and 0.002 respectively) and a higher alkaline phosphatase (p=0.008) compared to the controls. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that serum osteocalcin was inversely associated with fasting blood glucose and Diabetes Mellitus duration (β=− 0.018; p=0.007 and β=− 0.085; p=0.014 respectively) in Type 2 diabetic patients. In addition, alkaline phosphatase was positively associated (β=0.828; p=0.015) while serum calcium was negatively associated (β=− 0.046; p=0.048) with Diabetes Mellitus duration.
Conclusion
These results refer to the strong association between diabetes and bone turnover markers and call for monitoring of diabetes-associated osteopenia in type 2 diabetic patients."

To investigate the association between overweight and obesity (in terms of BMI) and diabetes, HBP and diabetes-HBP comorbidity among adult women non-pregnant in Bangladesh.
Methods
Information about demographics, socioeconomic, blood pressure and blood glucose levels were collected for 2022 women ageing above 35 years were collected from Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS 2011). The primary outcome variables were diabetes and high blood pressure. Diabetes was defined as fasting plasma glucose value ≥7.0mmol/L and HBP as systolic blood pressure ≥140mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90mmHg. Blood pressure and plasma glucose measurement were performed by standard clinical procedures. Data were analysed using cross-tabulation, chi-square tests and logistic regression methods.
Results
Mean age of the participants was 41.42 (SD=4.37). 38.7% of the women had BMI values ≥25. The prevalence of HBP, diabetes, and diabetes-HBP comorbidity was respectively 18% and 5.1%, and 2%. The adjusted odds of having diabetes, HBP and Diabetes-HBP comorbidity were respectively 2.14 (p=0.002; 95%CI=1.31–3.48), 2.3 (p=<0.0001; 95%CI=1.70–2.98), and 3.4 (p=0.004; 95%CI=1.47–7.81) times higher among overweight/obese women compared to those with normal weight.
Conclusions
Overweight and obesity account for a major proportion of diabetes, HBP and the comorbidity of these two among non-pregnant women. There remains a considerable risk for future expansion of diabetes and HBP as the prevalence of overweight/obesity is rising constantly. Maintaining a healthy BMI needs to be regarded as among the most important diabetes and HBP preventive strategies among Bangladeshi women."

In kidney, renal pathological changes leading to diabetic nephropathy are mainly secondary to atherosclerosis of the intra and extra renal arteries together with microangiopathy of the glomerular capillaries, afferent arterioles and efferent arterioles. Renal resistive index (RRI) is defined as a ratio of the difference between maximum and minimum (end-diastolic) flow velocity to maximum flow velocity derived from the Doppler measurements of main renal and intrarenal (segmental/interlobar) arteries. Renal resistive index is tightly related to renal arteriolosclerosis, and represents an integrated index of arterial compliance, pulsatility and downstream microvascular impedance. In meantime, growing suggest that RRI has also been closely related with atherosclerosis. Most studies performed in type 2 diabetes showed RRI is increased in type 2 diabetes. In this review, we summarize the data regarding RRI with regard to performed studies, pathogenesis and prognosis, especially focusing on type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Type 2 diabetes mellitus has assumed pandemic proportions worldwide. Aggressive management of hyperglycemia in diabetics is a primary goal of treatment. We have previously reported favorable effects of oral hypoglycemic agents on adipocytokines. Aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship of adipocytokines with anthropometric measures and biochemical parameters in type 2 diabetics.
Methods
Clinically diagnosed type 2 diabetics and age, gender matched healthy volunteers were recruited for study. Anthropometric measurements like height, weight, waist-circumference, hip-circumference were recorded and BMI, waist-hip ratio were calculated. Fasting blood samples were collected from participants and sera were analyzed for glucose, glycated haemoglobin, total cholesterol, SGOT, SGPT, insulin, adiponectin and leptin. Correlation of adipocytokines with anthropometric and biochemical parameters was assessed in healthy and diabetic individuals.
Results
BMI and WHR in diabetics were significantly higher than healthy population. BMI did not show significant association with adipocytokines. Diabetic males with WHR≥0.9 showed negative association with adiponectin and positive association with leptin. WC did not show significant association with adipocytokines in males. Irrespective of WC, healthy females exhibited positive association with leptin. Diabetic females with WC≥88cm showed leptin to be positively associated with WC. Such association of adipocytokines with WHR was not detected in females.
Conclusions
Body fat distribution can be considered as a parameter in assessing adipokine imbalance. Central adiposity is a better measure of adipokine imbalance than BMI. Abdominal obesity in diabetics correlates with altered levels of adipocytokines indicating its importance in diabetic individuals."

To assess the relationship of OC to glycaemic control and parameters of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and compare its levels in Nigerians with and without MetS.
Methods
The waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure of 200 study participants were taken. Plasma osteocalcin, fasting glucose (FPG), glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) and triglyceride (TG) levels were determined. Metabolic syndrome was defined by the International Diabetes Federation criteria. Statistical significance was set at 0.05.
Results
Osteocalcin levels were lower in the DM group (p=0.002) and inversely related to FPG (r=−0.198, p=0.003), HbA1c (r=−0.313, p<0.001), BMI (r=−0.331, p<0.001), WC (r=−0.339, p<0.001) and TG (r=−0.145, p=0.040), but directly related to HDL-c levels (r=0.166, p=0.019).

Conclusions
Plasma osteocalcin levels are inversely associated with good glycaemic control and components of MetS and are lower in individuals with DM and in those with MetS. These findings support a vital role of the bone, in the regulation of glucose and energy metabolism, in Nigerians. Further extensive studies are required to explore the potentials of OC in the management of DM and MetS."

Aim of the study was to detect the level of comprehensive diabetes control among the diabetic patients of Kerala, India.
Method
Patients (1200) were randomly selected from a diabetes care center. Their blood sugar and other biochemical and anthropometric measurements were done and statistically analyzed.
Result
Only 28.3% had their A1C at or below 7% and 45% above 9%. 1/3rd of the female and 1/5th of the male patients had CAD. The prevalence of hypertension was almost equal in both sexes. However, there was a statistically significant higher systolic BP (mean 162.12mm Hg vs 147.49mm Hg, p=0.01044) among females. The total Cholesterol was above 200mg/dl in 42.1% of males and 45.61% of females. The triglyceride was >150mg/dl in 38.6% males and 50.88% females. Low HDL cholesterol levels were found in 20.07% of males and 41.12% of females (p=0.0445). The mean LDL was 121.75 (±32.29247)
Discussion
The mean blood sugar values are found to be high which will lead to a predictable increase in vascular disease, which in turn will affect the quality of health and productivity of the individual and the economic growth of the society as a whole. Studies suggest that therapeutic interventions to improve glycemic control may reduce the risk of CVD and microvascular disease.
Conclusion
This study shows that the level of diabetes control in Kerala is unsatisfactory. We need more medications, better strategies, and more emphasis on glycemic management than we are currently able to apply."

Further both case and control group were sub-grouped in PCOS and non-PCOS with metabolic syndrome (wMetS) and without metabolic syndrome (woMetS) as per National Cholesterol Education Program Treatment Panel (NCEPATP) guidelines. Anthropometrical measurements and biochemical analysis were done. Leptin and adiponectin level were estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Results
Results indicated that SAD, WHR, BMI, BP, lipid profile, FPG, fasting plasma insulin, IR (HOMA-IR), leptin and L:A ratio were significantly higher (p=<0.001) in PCOS women compare to non PCOS. Furthermore anthropometrical values and level of FPG, TC, TG, Insulin, IR (HOMA-IR) and L:A ratio were significantly high (p=<0.001) in PCOS wMetS compare woMetS, however HDL (p=<0.001) and adiponectin level (p=<0.001) were significantly low. The same trend was also found in comparison between with and without MetS among non-PCOS women. The correlation between L:A Ratio with different metabolic risk markers, L:A ratio was positively significant with SAD (r=0.97, p <0.001), FPG (r=0.96, p<0.001), TC (r=0.44, p<0.001), insulin (r=0.98, p<0.001), IR (r=0.97, p<0.001), Adiponectin (r=0.21, p<0.01) and negatively significant with HDL(r=−0.42, p<0.001) in PCOS wMetS whereas L:A ratio was also positively correlated with SAD, BMI, TG in PCOS woMetS.
Conclusions
Study concluded L:A ratio may be one of the potential biomarker for metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance which is independent for presence of PCOS disease."

abstract = "Aim
The impact of fasting blood glucose levels (FBG) and disease duration on type 2 diabetes in Indian population is still unclear. The present study examines gender-dependent effects of FBG and disease duration on lipid profile, adipocytokines and related biochemical parameters in diabetic individuals.
Methods
Type 2 diabetic individuals (n=100) were classified depending on FBG: patients with normal FBG (Glucose<126mg/dl) and patients with high FBG (Glucose≥126mg/dl); and disease duration: ≥0–≤3yr, >3–≤7yr, >7yr.
Results
Males with high FBG had significantly higher serum glucose, triglycerides, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) and waist hip ratio (WHR) than males with normal FBG. Females with high FBG had significant increase in serum glucose, adiponectin and creatinine while decrease in leptin levels than females with normal FBG. Males with high FBG had higher WHR, superoxide dismutase, SGOT, SGPT and lower adiponectin, leptin than females with high FBG. Significant positive association was observed between glucose and cholesterol, triglyceride, VLDL and urea in males with high FBG. With chronic diabetes for >7yr, males had increased systolic blood pressure, glucose, LDL, urea and low catalase activity as compared to other disease duration groups. However, females had higher adiponectin, creatinine and lower body mass index and cholesterol.
Conclusions
High FBG in males adversely affects lipid profile, adipocytokines and liver function. Some of these effects exacerbate as disease progresses. Higher adiponectin may have desirable effects on metabolic markers in females."

The use of pharmacological therapy is often limited in some patients due to a loss of effect over time or development of adverse effects such as weight gain or hypoglycaemia. This has prompted searches into the role of non-pharmacological therapies in T2DM. The availability and use of vitamin supplements in developed countries have increased significantly and there is evidence that certain vitamins may have roles in the management of T2DM. This review examines the literature assessing the use of vitamins A, C, E, D, K and the B group vitamins (B1, B3, B7, B6, B9, B12) in the management of T2DM. No clear evidence supporting the beneficial role of any specific vitamin in the treatment of T2DM was found. Thus, it is recommended that until further studies are conducted to clarify the role of such vitamins in T2DM management, they should not be routinely recommended in clinical practice."

The sodium glucose co-transporters 2 inhibitors are a new class of glucose-lowering agents, which act through a novel mechanism by producing a decline in glucose re-absorption in the kidney, thereby increasing glycosuria and decreasing serum glucose levels. Data suggest that apart from lowering HbA1c, they produce a small but significant weight loss and a small decrease in blood pressure. Also, they possess nephro-protective potential. These drugs are demonstrated to restore intra-glomerular pressure by increasing angiotensin (1–7), which exerts vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory effects. Their profile on cardiovascular events is still under investigation. In this review, the pleiotropic potential of this novel class of glucose-lowering levels will be discussed. Further research is warranted to determine their safety in the long term."

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major health problem in Sudan and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of glycaemic control among individuals with type 2 diabetes across different cities in Sudan.
Methods
Individuals with type 2 diabetes attending selected diabetes centres in Sudan, who had been on treatment for DM for at least one year and volunteered to participate were included. Participants were interviewed using standardized pretested questionnaire to record medical history, sociodemographic and life style characteristics. Lipid profile and glycosylated hemoglobin were tested by calibrated laboratory methods. Blood pressure, Body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference were measured. Chi squared and logistic regression were used as statistical methods.
Results
A total of 387 individuals with T2DM were included in this study (50.4% males and 49.6% females). The glycemic control indicator (HbAIc>7) was poor in 85% of patients. Factors associated with poor glycemic control were prolonged duration of diabetes (p=0.03), high plasma triglyceride (p=0.02), low high density lipoprotein (HDL) level (p=0.04) and low glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (P=0.01). Logistic regression analysis showed that low GFR is independent factor with poor diabetes control.

The aim of this study
The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between metabolic syndrome and its components with bone mineral density in post menopausal women referred for bone mineral density (BMD) test.
Methods
A total of 143 postmenopausal women with at least one year of menopause experience participated in this cross-sectional study. Demographic and anthropometric characteristics for all participants were collected. Also, biochemical parameters including fasting blood sugar, Cholesterol (HDL and LDL), triglyceride were measured. Association between the components of metabolic syndrome and bone densitometry were analyzed by statistical methods.
Results
In this study, 72% of participants did not have metabolic syndrome. Among them, 43.4% and 28.7% had osteoporosis and normal density, respectively. Of remaining participants with metabolic syndrome, 12.6% and 15.4% had osteoporosis and normal density, respectively. Among the metabolic syndrome components, waist circumference, HDL cholesterol, and waist to hip ratio were significantly associated with bone mass (P<0.05). Osteoporotic women had lower waist circumference and waist to hip ratio and higher HDL than women without osteoporosis. On the other hand, women with metabolic syndrome did not have significant differences than women without metabolic syndrome in terms of lumbar and femoral neck density (P>0.05).
Conclusion
Results from this study showed that metabolic syndrome and its components did not induce bone mass loss. The discrepancies of the studies in this area call for more large scale studies in population so as to prevent women problems in this area."

Recent studies indicate that modulation of post prandial blood sugar (PPBS) plays an important role in the long term glycemic control. Measurement of PPBS is more convenient for patients attending outpatient clinics than fasting blood sugar (FBS) as the former needs only two hours of fasting from the last meal.
Objective
To assess the value of PPBS monitoring in optimization of long term glycemic control among diabetic patients attending an outpatient clinic.
Methods
A total of 240 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) attending an out-patient medical clinic were randomized to either PPBS or FBS monitoring. Those who selected to PPBS-group underwent blood sugar measurement 2-h after last meal on the day of their clinic visits and those in the FBS group underwent blood sugar measurement after fasting overnight (8–10h) in the morning of their clinic visits. Treating team was asked to optimize the anti-diabetic medications based on the available PPBS or FBS results. All patients were followed up monthly for six months. Glycemic control was assessed with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at baseline and six months later.
Results
Baseline characteristics of the two arms including age, gender, and duration of T2DM were not significantly different. Mean HbA1c (SD) of FBS and PPBS arms at baseline were 7.20 (0.45), and 7.33 (0.43) and were not significantly different (P=0.115). During the study period, HbA1c dropped by 0.20 in FBS arm compared to 0.25 drop in PPBS arm (p=0.59). Incidence of hypoglycemia was similar in FBS (2.42%) and PPBS arms (2.70%).
Conclusion
Monitoring of PPBS is a safe and effective alternative to FBS to optimize glycemic control in managing patients with T2DM attending outpatient clinics."

We aim to evaluate the prevalence of DM and MetSyn among HCV patients, focusing on age-specific and race/ethnicity-specific disparities.
Methods
We retrospectively evaluated 2003–2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data for age and race disparities in concurrent DM and MetSyn among HCV patients. Multivariate logistic regression models evaluated for independent predictors of DM and MetSyn among HCV patients.
Results
Overall U.S. prevalence of HCV was 1.29% from 2003 to 2012 and prevalence of DM and MetSyn among HCV patients was 17.5% and 35.0%, respectively. Higher rates of DM (36.9% vs. 3.3%, p<0.001) and MetSyn (50.5% vs. 11.7%, p<0.001) were seen among HCV patients ≥60 compared to <40years. The highest rates of DM and MetSyn were seen among African Americans (AA) (DM: 39.1%, MetSyn: 29.2%) and the lowest in non-Hispanic whites (DM: 9.4%, MetSyn: 33.0%). On multivariate regression, patients ≥60 were significantly more likely to have DM compared to patients <40 years (OR 11.90, 95% CI 2.73–52.60, p=0.001); AA were significantly more likely to have DM compared to non-Hispanic whites (OR 2.82, 95% CI 1.53–5.20, p=0.001).

abstract = "Aims
Basal insulin has been shown to effectively reduce fasting blood glucose (FBG), but postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) excursions may remain higher than normal. Glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 receptor agonists such as the short-acting lixisenatide are able to control such excursions by slowing gastric emptying. However, data regarding its use in a real world clinical setting are scarce.
Methods
24 week, prospective, multicentre, non-interventional study in 1437 patients with type-2 diabetes receiving 20μg lixisenatide once daily in combination with basal insulin. The per-protocol set (PPS) comprised 540 patients.
Results
HbA1c levels were found to decrease significantly over 24 weeks of treatment in the PPS (0.94±0.99% [7.9±8.5]; p≤0.001). An HbA1c of <7% (53mmol/mol) was achieved in 26.9% of patients, with 9.8% reaching <6.5% (48mmol/mol) and 30.0% reaching their individual treatment goal. There was a slight decrease in FBG (2.84±30.4mg/dl; p≤0.001), and a significant reduction in PPG, with levels decreasing by between 35mg/dl (1.9mmol/l) and 38mg/dl (2.1mmol/l), respectively on average after all main meals in basal optimised patients (PPS; ≤140mg/dl). Body weight decreased from 101 to 98kg with a mean difference of 3.10±4.10kg (p≤0.001). There were few reports of hypoglycaemia and no reports of serious hypoglycaemia and need for external help. AEs were infrequent, and were in line with previous studies.
Conclusions
Lixisenatide in combination with basal insulin was shown to be an effective treatment strategy for patients with type 2 diabetes, controlling HbA1c levels by reduction of PPG excursions during the whole day."

All subjects were evaluated for thyroid function tests such as triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), T3 resin uptake (T3RU), free T3 (FT3), free T4 (FT4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), before treatment. After completing DKA treatment and two weeks after discharge, the thyroid function tests were repeated on the subjects and the results were analyzed using paired T-test, ANOVA or repeated measure and Pearson correlation tests. the current study showed that the mean levels of T3 and T4 were at hyperthyroid range and lower than normal before the treatment and significantly increased after the treatment (P<0.001). The serum levels of T3RU, FT4 and T4 were at the normal range, but their mean level increased significantly following the treatment progression (P<0.001).A significant relationship was observed among blood pH and the serum levels of FT3 and T3, before the treatment; the lower pH, the lower levels of FT3 and T3. The results of the current study showed that DKA causes euthyroid sick syndrome. The disease complications were resolved two weeks after treatment and the severity of acidosis was the main factor to decrease the level of active form of thyroid hormones such as FT3 and T3."

Available antihyperglycemic agents have minimal or no impact on these complications and a majority are known to trigger weight gain, thereby exerting a paradoxical effect on overall metabolic status. This review introduces the concept of ‘KgA1c paradox’ and underscores the significance of resolving this paradox for comprehensive T2DM management. It provides a therapeutic rationale for inclusion of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in the T2DM treatment algorithm as these agents have demonstrated favorable glycemic effects along with reduction in body weight."

Introduction
Diabetic nephropathy is responsible for nearly third of the world cases of end stage renal disease; it becomes a major public health problem with social and economic burden. The aim of this study is to explore if there is an association between retinopathy and nephropathy.
Material and Methods
In a cross sectional hospital based study a total of 316 individuals with diabetes were recruited from Makkah eye complex retina clinic. Demographic data, medical history and life style characteristics were taken through standard questionnaire. In addition, urine samples were collected to check for presence of albuminuria, blood samples were taken to measure HbA1c, lipid profile and renal function test.
Results
The mean age of participants was 58±10 years old. Only 39.8 and 40.2% of females were diagnosed with retinopathy and nephropathy, respectively. In addition, 60.2 and 59.8% of males were diagnosed with retinopathy and nephropathy, respectively. Hypertension was identified as risk factors for both retinopathy and nephropathy (P<0.001 and P<0.07). Serum creatinine and blood urea are significantly associated with retinopathy (P<0.01 and P<0.01). Body mass index (BMI) and HbA1c are not significantly associated with retinopathy and nephropathy. The prevalence of nephropathy among individuals with retinopathy was 35.6%. There was significant association between nephropathy and development of retinopathy (P<0.01). Logistic regression showed that two absolute risk factors are: nephropathy and having hypertension with P value of 0.009 and 0.003, respectively.
Conclusions
Almost third of diabetic patients developed nephropathy, significant association between nephropathy and development of retinopathy was found."

The number of diabetic patients is increasing in the world. Peripheral neuropathy is the most important problem of diabetes. Neuropathy eventually leads to balance impairment which is the main cause of falling down in these patients However, not sufficient evidences available to compare different protocols for improving balance in diabetic patients.
Objective
This study aimed to compare the effects of two therapeutic exercises on clinical balance measures in patients with type II diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
Methods
The study was performed on 60 patients with diabetes categorized randomly into three groups: an intervention group (N=20) that received ball training exercise, another intervention group (N=20) that received Frenkel exercise and a control group (N=20) that received no interventions. Exercise training session was performed for 3 weeks. Then, clinical balance measures were computed in the three groups. Paired t-test and one-way ANOVA were used to analyze the collected data.
Results
Both types of therapeutic exercise programs significantly improved balance in single leg stance, star excursion test, and Berg balance scale test (P˂0.05) compared to the control group. Besides, this was more significant in the ball training group (P˂0.05).
Conclusions
To improve balance in diabetic neuropathy, Swiss ball exercise is preferred compared to Frenkel training."

Methods
One hundred and sixty six subjects were selected for this study. Clinical data was obtained while laboratory investigations including plasma glucose and lipid profile were performed. Statistical analysis was done with SPSS 20.0. P<0.05 was taken as statistically significant.
Results
School teachers had significantly higher mean total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol compared to auto technicians. Mean serum triglycerides was significantly higher among auto-technicians compared to school teachers in this study. The prevalence of some conventional cardiovascular risk factors was significantly higher among auto-technicians compared to school teachers: Impaired blood glucose (9.6% vs. 1.2%, p<0.05), hypertriglyceridaemia (18.1% vs. 7.2%, p<0.05) and low HDL-Cholesterol (47.0% vs. 37.3%, p<0.05) respectively. However elevated LDL-cholesterol (56.6% vs. 32.5%, p<0.05) was significantly more common among school teachers compared to auto-technicians. Based on the WHO and the Harmonized criteria, metabolic syndrome was more frequent among auto-technicians compared to school teachers. (8.4% vs. 1.2% and 19.3% vs. 7.2% respectively, p<0.05)
Conclusion
The prevalence of metabolic syndrome appears to be significantly higher among auto technicians despite their high level of physical activity, exertion and education compared to teachers. This may be related to the increased occupational exposure to organic and inorganic materials from dust particles, oil and oil related matter and particulate matter among auto technicians. Prompt definitive evaluation of this concept and appropriate health education to encourage safety mechanism can reduce this burden of metabolic syndrome among auto technicians in Nigeria."

To analyze the lipid profile of older people aged ≥80 years according to body composition (high fat mass, low muscle mass and both).
Material and method
: The sample consisted of 113 older people aged ≥80 years. The assessment of body composition was made using Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) and the lipid profile analysis using an enzymatic colorimetric kit. We used Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test to compare the mean of lipid profile according to body composition and were constructed logistic regression models to verify the association between these two variables.
Results
It was found that older people with high fat had higher mean values of TG compared to normal and low muscle mass group. Older people with low muscle mass showed mean values of LDL-c lower than other groups. It was observed that older people with high fat is more likely to have (OR 2.70; 95%CI 1.14-6.37) high blood concentration of TG.
Conclusion
Thus, it appears that high fat is related to the high blood concentration of TG in older people aged ≥80 years, especially those with Asian origin and diabetes besides those with low muscle mass shows lower mean values of LDL-c."

abstract = "Aims
Metabolic syndrome (MetS) increases atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. Low HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) is a diagnostic criterion of MetS and a major ASCVD risk factor. HDL particle concentration (HDL-P) associates with incident ASCVD independent of HDL-C, but its association with incident MetS has not been studied. We hypothesized that HDL-P would be inversely associated with incident metabolic syndrome independent of HDL-C and markers of adiposity and insulin resistance.
Materials and methods
HDL-P was measured by NMR and visceral fat by MRI in participants of the Dallas Heart Study, a probability-based population sample of adults age 30–65. Participants with prevalent MetS, DM, CVD, and any systemic illlness were excluded. Incident MetS as defined by NCEP ATPIII criteria was determined in all participants after median follow-up period of 7.0 years.
Results
Among 1120 participants without DM or MetS at baseline (57% women, 45% Black, mean age 43), 22.8% had incident MetS at follow-up. HDL-P and HDL-C were modestly correlated (r=0.54, p<0.0001). In models adjusted for traditional risk factors and MetS risk factors including visceral fat, HS-CRP, triglyceride to HDL-C ratio, and HOMA-IR, the lowest quartile of HDL-P was associated with a 2-fold increased risk of incident MetS (OR 2.1, 95%CI 1.4–3.1; p=0.0003).
Conclusions
Low HDL-P is independently associated with incident MetS after adjustment for traditional risk factors, lipid parameters, adiposity, inflammation, and markers of insulin resistance. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings and elucidate the mechanisms underpinning this association."

The present study used data from the National Survey of Health, Wellbeing, and Aging survey to examine the prevalence of abdominal obesity according to certain demographic, behavioral, and health characteristics of the participants. Logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders were used to evaluate the association of abdominal obesity with cardio metabolic risk factors.
Results
Of 2053 participants aged 60 years and older, the prevalence of abdominal obesity was 65.9% (95% CI; 62.2%, 69.4%) in women and 16.3% (95% CI; 13.8%, 19.2%) in men. Notably, a higher prevalence of abdominal obesity was seen among residents in the urban areas of the country, those who reported their race as black or mulatto, individuals with sedentary lifestyle and obesity, and older adults with greater number of comorbidities. Moreover, after adjustment for potential confounders, women with abdominal obesity were 2.0, 2.8, and 1.6 times more likely to have diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, and hypertriglyceridemia as compared with those without, respectively. Likewise, men with abdominal obesity had 51% and 22% higher rates of hypertension and diabetes than their non-obese counterparts, respectively.
Conclusions
the prevalence of abdominal obesity is high among older adults in Ecuador. Moreover, abdominal obesity is significantly associated with cardio metabolic risk factors. Therefore, further research is needed to evaluate sociodemographic and nutritional determinants of this emerging public health burden among older Ecuadorians."

A cross-sectional study was conducted among 200 diabetic pregnant mothers (age in yrs, M±SD, 30±4), selected purposively from outpatient department of Bangladesh Institute of Research and Rehabilitation in Diabetes, Endocrine & Metabolic Disorders. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. SPSS 16.0 were used for data analysis.
Results
About 40% mothers had uncontrolled glycaemic status. 43% mothers believed that food should not be taken during the ‘call for prayer’ and 91% of them practiced it. For ‘eclipse’ the percentage of such kind of belief was much higher (80%) and 90% of them practiced it. With varying proportion for particular fishes 44–58% respondents believed that some fishes should be avoided due to the increased movement of child, fetal malformation and disease. 93% actually practiced it. 28% had adverse beliefs about duck meat, 78% pineapple and 8% had about coconut. The corresponding percentages for practice were 82%, 99% and 50% respectively. Mentally and physically abnormal child, different kinds of child illness and threat of abortion were among the reasons for misbeliefs about those foods.

Hence, the purpose of the present study is to determine the relationship between the GDM and the family history of diabetes using the meta-analysis method.
Method
All published papers in main national and international databases were systematically searched with some specific keywords to find the related studies between 2000 and 2016. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) in analysis for each study using a random-effect and Mantel-Haenzel method. We also determined heterogeneity among these 33 articles and their publication bias.
Results
We entered 33 relevant studies of 2516 articles into the meta-analysis process including 2697 women with family history of diabetes mellitus as well as 29134 women without. Of them, 954 and 4372 subjects developed GDM respectively. Combining the results of the primary studies using the meta-analysis method, the overall odds ratio of family history for developing GDM was estimated as of 3.46 (95% CI: 2.80–4.27).

To assess the efficacy of a unified hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) insulin infusion protocol (IIP), based on an Excel algorithm and implemented as an electronic order set, in achieving glycemic targets and minimizing hypoglycemia.
Methods
An IIP was instituted in medical and surgical intensive care units for post-cardiac surgery (PCS) and other stress hyperglycemia (SH), diabetes hyperglycemia (DH), and DKA. The IIP initiated therapeutic insulin rates at elevated blood glucose (BG), and decreased insulin when target range was achieved. A convenience sample (n=62) was studied; 20 PCS, 15 with DH, 9 with SH, 8 with diabetes on vasopressors, 7 with diabetes on glucocorticoids and 3 with DKA were assessed.
Results
The protocol maintained BG at 144±24.7mg/dL for PCS and 167±36mg/dL for patients with diabetes mellitus. It maintained acceptable target range (ATR) (100mg/dL–180mg/dL) 89% of the time for PCS and 67% of the time for patients with diabetes mellitus. There were no measurements of BG<70mg/dL. The protocol lowered the BG at a similar rate and time period in those with diabetes, DKA and those with or without vasopressors or glucocorticoids. To determine long-term efficacy, a retrospective review of Point of Care (POC) RALS (Remote Automated Data System) BG data 2 years post implementation demonstrated fewer episodes of hypoglycemia<70mg/dL and hyperglycemia>240mg/dL and more BG values within ATR.
Conclusions
This IIP maintained ATR without hypoglycemia for patients in the ICU setting without requiring complex nursing calculations."

abstract = "Background
Metabolic Syndrome (MS) is defined as the combination of a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors. The use of cardiovascular indices such as the ratios TC/HDL-c, LDL-c/HDL-c and TG/HDL-c may help in the assessment of cardiovascular risk. Investigation of cardio-metabolic risks in the pre-adolescent stage is essential to characterize possible patterns for MS in the earliest stages of the life avoiding further irreversible consequences.
Aims
This work aimed to investigate the presence of MS and cardiovascular indices in a group of children aged 6–10 years.
Methods
We included 150 children from a city in Brazil. Anthropometric (Body Mass Index and Waist Circumference) and biochemical parameters (glycaemia, total cholesterol, LDL-c, HDL-c, and triglycerides) were evaluated in order to identify the presence of MS. Atherogenic Indices were also calculated (TC/HDL-c, LDL-c/HDL-c and TG/HDL-c).
Results
Our results showed that there are high percentages of children with altered values for biochemical and anthropometric parameters and in the atherogenic indices. MS was identified in 17.8% of the children. The main parameters related to alterations in the atherogenic indices were waist circumference, body mass index and the presence of MS.
Conclusion
The high prevalence of MS and alterations in the atherogenic indices in schoolchildren is a worrying panorama. We suggest the performance of more studies focusing on identification, intervention and prevention programs in order to reduce the risk factors of this syndrome in childhood and to reduce future cardiovascular deaths."

Deficiency of vitamin B12 and folate is rare in developed countries and the countries which adopted fortification programs, but deficiency of these vitamins is found to be highly prevalent in developing world, particularly in Pakistan. Several studies have found an association of high homocysteine levels and diabetes, but a few studies found contrary results. Hence, further epidemiological studies are recommended for homocysteine involvement in diabetes and vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, so that an urgent action can be taken to control the hyperhomocysteinaemia and consequently the ever increasing burden of disease and specifically diabetes."

To determine the prevalence of Thyroid dysfunction among Type 2 Diabetes mellitus.
Methodology
A cross-sectional hospital-based study is conducted to find out the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction. 713 type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) subjects were enrolled in the survey. These subjects were investigated for fasting blood sugar (FBS), glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), total triiodothyronine (T3), total thyroxine (T4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).
Results
Prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in T2DM was found in 16.2%. Gender-specific prevalence found higher in females (25%) compared to males (10.1%) (P<0.001). Age-specific prevalence found higher in the age group ≥50 yrs. (19%) Compared to other age groups (P=0.036). Subjects with poor glycaemic control demonstrated higher prevalence (27.9%) (P=0.012). Subjects with long-standing T2DM had an increased risk for thyroid dysfunction (19.8%) though findings were not statistically significant. (P=0.42).
Conclusion
The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction with T2DM (16.2%) was high in females compared to males and especially hypothyroidism being more typical. Failure to recognise the presence of thyroid dysfunction among T2DM patients may be a primary cause of poor management of diabetes. We recommend universal screening and regular monitoring of thyroid dysfunction in T2DM patients."

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of hearing loss and its association with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a highly endogamous population.
Design
This is a cross-sectional study.
Setting
The present study is carried out in Ear Nose Throat (ENT) and Endocrinology outpatient clinics of the Hamad General and Rumeilah Hospitals, Hamad Medical Corporation.
Subjects
All subjects aged between 20 and 59 years who visited the Endocrinology and ENT outpatient clinics of the Hamad Medical Corporation with hearing difficulty were included in this study during the period from January 2013 to July 2014.
Method
During the study period, prevalence, hearing, audiological test, family history and medical problems associated with hearing impairment in middle aged patients were recorded. Two audiometers Grason Stadler GSI 61 and Madsen Orbiter 922 were used to evaluate the hearing loss.
Result
Majority of the hearing loss observed at the age above 45 years old, (44.8% vs 51.7%, p=0.05). The prevalence of hearing impairment was higher in Qataris than in non-Qataris (59.7% vs 46.6%, p<0.001). The consanguineous marriages were observed higher in Hearing loss (32.1%) than in normal hearing (21.8%) (p=0.028). The mean of diabetes onset duration (7.8±4.12years), sleeping disorder (5.81±1.29h), obese subjects (38% vs 27.4%); family history of diabetes (30.6 vs 23.1%) were higher among hearing impairment. The associated risk factors were significantly higher in T2DM with hearing loss, hypoglycemia (32.8% vs 27.4%), retinopathy (313% vs 18.5%), Nephropathy (17.9% vs 9.8%), Neuropathy (17.9% vs 10.2%), macro-vascular disease (11.9% vs 6.2%), diabetic foot ulcer (20.9% vs 12.6%), Tinnitus (68.7% vs 51.3%), and Vertigo (25.4% vs 16.9%) than in normal hearing diabetes. There was a statistically significant differences between hearing impairment and normal hearing among T2DM regarding hearing assessment frequency (p=0.041). There were statistically significant differences between hearing impairment versus normal hearing for vitamin D [18.91±7.65ng/mL vs 22.85±9.00ng/mL; p<0.001], calcium [1.80±0.12ng/mL vs 1.96±0.14mmol/L; p<0.001], magnesium [0.80±0.09mmol/L vs 0.8±0.14mmol/L; p<0.001], phosphorous [1.42±0.30mmol/L vs 1.56±0.26mmol/L; p<0.001], ceatinine [1.42±0.30mmol/L vs 1.56±0.26mmol/L; p<0.001], cholesterol [4.92±1.08mmol/L vs 4.40±1.01mmol/L; p=0.035], LDL [1.92±0.88mmol/L vs 2.09±0.92mmol/L; p=0.024], albumin [43.1±6.10mmol/L vs 39.8±7.93mmol/L; p=0.010], systolic blood pressure [135.8±16.6Hg vs 130.2±12.5Hg; p=0.017] and, diastolic blood pressure [85.1±9.2mmHg vs 83.0±7.9mmHg; p=0.012]. There were highly statistically significant differences between hearing impairment versus normal for both side right and left ear frequency in Db unit (p<0.001). The multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that head ache (p<0.001), family history of DM (p<0.001), sleep disturbance (p<0.001), high blood pressure (p=0.006), consanguinity (p=0.010), nationality (p=0.014), age in years (p=0.025), and sheesha smokers (p=0.045) were considered at higher risk as a predictors of hearing loss among diabetic patients.
Conclusion
The current study results confirm previous reports that adults with DM and hypertension associated showed greater hearing impairment in highly endogamous population… Diabetic patients with hearing loss were likely to have high blood glucose and other risk factors like hypertension, retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy."

Chronic undernutrition across a lifetime may be an imperative stimulator of diabetes in an individual either by progressively reducing beta cell function alongside islet cell volume and increasing the individual predisposition to other genetic or environmental diabetogenic influences with modifying influence on the course of clinical syndrome. Ketosis resistant insulinopenia is irreversible to the sustained vigorous nutritional convalescence in a substantial fraction of malnourished subjects. It also debunks a latent diabetic stage with insulin resistance reflected by greater insulin requirement in comparison to the patients with type I diabetes with the same beta cell failure fraction and obese type II diabetic patients with equivalent glycemic control gauged by HbA1c levels. Current tendency warrants the replacement of conventional therapy by community oriented theranostic approaches and health programs to curb the epidemic."

Although T2DM patients have higher incidence of macrovascular and microvascular CV complications than the general population, whether cardiac biomarkers would be effective to risk stratification of the T2DM is not fully understood. The role of natriuretic peptides, galectin-3, interleukins, growth differentiation factor-15, as well as biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction are widely discussed.

abstract = "Background
The importance of dyslipidemia is well recognized in the context of both risk factor for acute pancreatitis and prognostic factor for its in-hospital outcomes. With a growing appreciation of post-pancreatitis diabetes mellitus, there is a need to catalogue changes in lipid metabolism after hospitalization due to an acute pancreatitis attack and their associations with glucose metabolism.
Objective
To investigate lipid metabolism in patients with impaired glucose homeostasis following acute pancreatitis.
Methods
There were two study groups: newly diagnosed chronic hyperglycemia or normoglycemia after acute pancreatitis. During the fasting state, venous blood samples were collected to analyse markers of lipid metabolism (triglycerides, glycerol, low density lipoprotein, high density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, free fatty acids, and apolipoprotein-B) and glucose metabolism (HbA1c, insulin, index of adipose tissue insulin resistance (Adipo-IR), and HOMA-IR). Binary logistic and linear regression analyses were conducted, and potential confounders were adjusted for in multivariate analyses.
Results
The study included 64 patients with normoglycemia and 19 - with chronic hyperglycemia. Glycerol was significantly associated with the development of chronic hyperglycemia in both unadjusted (p=0.02) and adjusted (p=0.006) models. Triglycerides were significantly associated with the development of chronic hyperglycemia in adjusted (p=0.019) model. Other markers of lipid metabolism did not differ significantly between the two groups. None of the markers of lipid metabolism was significantly associated with Adipo-IR or HOMA-IR.
Conclusion
Overall, patients with chronic hyperglycemia after acute pancreatitis appear to have a lipid profile indicative of an up-regulation of lipolysis, which is not significantly affected by either general or adipose tissue-specific insulin resistance."

Subject and methods
A cross-sectional study conducted from February 2016 to September 2016. Of the total 1500 diabetic patients approached, 1094 (72.9%) gave their consent. Data analysis included, sociodemographic, serum lipid profiles (LDL, HDL), calcium, uric acid, blood pressure and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at baseline and after six months. The Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) tools were used to measure the patient satisfaction.
Results
The mean and standard deviation of age among gender, there were significant differences between males (51.81±14.40) and females (49.76±13.99) (p=0.024). There were statistically significant differences between males and females regarding place of living (city 76% vs town 26%) p<0.001) and consanguinity (p=0.040). Almost of the patients with diabetes were overweight (males 44.5% vs females 41.8%) while more than a quarter (31.2%) males were obese.

Multivariate stepwise regression analysis showed that the satisfaction DTSQ scores for HbA1c (p<0.001), h of sleep (p<0.001), neuropathy (p=0.007), diabetic education (p=0.014), SBP (mmHg) (p=0.021) DBP (mmHg) (p=0.028) were identified as significantly associated with higher treatment satisfaction.
Conclusion
The study confirms a positive correlation between diabetes patient’s satisfaction with care and treatment. Females DM patients compared to males had a better satisfaction score with current treatment, unacceptably low blood glucose level, flexibility in treatment and understanding of DM."

Asymptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) in symptom-free subjects, and people with the metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a significant correlate of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, little is known about their relationship and whether this is mediated through central obesity as one of the defining components of the MetS.
Materials and methods
In a cross-sectional setting, 150 asymptomatic healthy premenopausal women without previously diagnosed hypertension, diabetes or known history cardiovascular diseases were consecutively enrolled. Ankle-brachial index (ABI), various parameters of general and central body fat distribution, and MetS were assessed.
Results
The prevalence rates for asymptomatic PAD and MetS within the study population were calculated at 6% and 44%, respectively. Following the rigorous adjustment made by the components of MetS and clincial variables of age and serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterols (LDL-C), several indicators of general and central body fat distribution, including total, truncal and visceral body fats were found to have significantly positive correlations with log-ABI values. Moreover, log-ABI was significantly and negatively associated with the presence of MetS in both crude and multivariate models of logistic regression analysis, as adjusted by age, LDL-C and several indices of general and central fat deposition (OR [95% CI]: 0.016 [0.001 to 0.424], P value=0.013 in the multivariate adjusted model).
Conclusion
ABI had positive and negative associations with central obesity and MetS, respectively. Our findings strongly suggest the inverse correlation between ABI and the MetS is likely not mediated through central obesity as one the key components of MetS."

Metabolic syndrome is highly prevalent among patients with type II diabetes and is reported as a strong risk factor for cardiovascular diseases as well as carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The aim of the current study was to compare median nerve indices among diabetic patients with and without metabolic syndrome.
Methods
This cross-sectional study was conducted on 105 patients with type II diabetes whom participated in the coronary artery disease risk factor study in Kerman, Iran (KERCARDS). Patients with type II diabetes were called and those with clinical symptoms of CTS were included in the study, and median nerve indices were measured according to standard electro diagnosis tests. GEE statistical model was used to compare median nerve indices among diabetic patients with and without metabolic syndrome. All statistical analysis was done using SPSS 20.0.
Results
The mean age of participants was 57.57±9.53. There was no significant difference between the left and right hand regarding median nerve indices except median nerve motor amplitude (MA). Furthermore, components of metabolic syndrome including BMI and LDL were determined as risk factors for CTS according to several indices.
Conclusion
Components of metabolic syndrome had more influence on sensory indices than motor indices and primary control of these components might prevent dysfunction of sensory neurons and also motor neurons in advanced stages among diabetic patients."

A principal component analysis revealed high contribution rates for the components (69.32%–88.77%). A confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the components of the questionnaire had adequate model fit (goodness of fit index=0.997, adjusted goodness of fit index=0.984, comparative fit index=0.998, and root mean square error of approximation=0.049). Notably, data from participants within the suburbs did not support the theory of planned behavior construction. Several paths did not predict the hypothesis variables. However, attitudes toward healthy food choices strongly predicted behavioral intention (path coefficients 0.49–0.77, p<0.01), regardless of demographic characteristics.
Conclusion
Our results support that the theory of planned behavior can apply to secondary school students in urban areas. Furthermore, attitudes towards healthy food choices were the best predictor of behavioral intentions to engage in such choices in Inner Mongolian students."

To investigate the link between benign prostatic hypertrophy, BMI and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Materials and methods
This was the retrospective study conducted at the urology clinic of NCRHA and SWRHA, in Trinidad. Data was obtained from 85 patients with high PSA values (>4.0ng/mL). The data collected were age, ethnicity, weight, height, lifestyle and their most recent blood sugar levels were recorded. Ultrasound reports of patients diagnosed with BPH were also analyzed to gather data on whether their hyperplasia was benign or malignant.
Results
The majority of the sample population was of Afro-Trinidadian descent (41) followed by East Indian descent (26) and then of mixed ethnicity (18). Individuals in the sample population with a normal BMI had a mean PSA value of 23.66ng/mL, while those with a BMI in the overweight range had a mean PSA value of 28.1ng/mL, and those with a BMI in the obese range had a mean PSA value of 18.5ng/mL. There were no statistically significant differences in the mean values of PSA levels between diabetics and non-diabetics, between the 3 major ethnic groups in our sample population and between the 3 different groupings based on BMI ranges. However it was found that the average mean age of patients of East Indian descent (62.96±2.23) was significantly lower than that of patients of African descent (70.15±2.02).
Conclusions
This study did not show any significant differences in the mean values of PSA levels between diabetics and non-diabetics, between the 3 different groupings based on BMI ranges."

Foot ulcer is also a clinical marker for limb amputation and for death in diabetic patients. The purpose of this study was to determine amputation and mortality rates and its associated factors in patients with diabetic foot ulcerations in a tertiary hospital in Brazil.
Methods
Retrospective medical records from 654 diabetic foot patients were reviewed. The risk factors were determined using the conditional logistic regression model analysis.
Results
The mean patient age was 63.1 years (SD 12.20). Peripheral arterial disease was present in 160 patients (24.5%). Major amputations were performed in 135 (21%). The in-hospital mortality rate was 12% and the mortality rate of the amputees was 22.2%. The lowest hemoglobin level, the median value was 9.50g/dL, (4.0–17.0). Anemia was detected in 89.6% of patients submitted to amputation and in 82,1% of those who died. Hemoglobin <11g/dL was the most significant risk factor for major amputation (odds ratio 5.57, p<0.0001). The presence of peripheral arterial disease and old age were also a risk for major amputation (odds ratio 1.84, p=0.007 and 1.02, p=0.028, respectively). Factors associated with increased risk for death were hemoglobin <11g/dL (odds ratio 4.04, p<0.001), major amputation (1.79, p=0.03) and old age (1.05, p<0,001).
Conclusions
Diabetic foot ulcer is associated with high amputation and mortality rates. Old age, peripheral arterial disease and low hemoglobin level are risk factor for major amputation. Old age, major amputation and low hemoglobin level are risk factors for death."

Genetic variation of disease susceptible genes is different in different ethnic groups and there is an evidence of association of polymorphisms of Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors (PPARs) in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). This research analyses the association of PPARs in early and late onset of T2DM in North Indian Population (NIP).
Methods
Total of 703 subjects were recruited from north of India and subjects were further divided into subjects of early onset (less than 25 years of onset, 26 T2DM and 26 controls) and late onset (more than 25 years of onset, 326 T2DM and 325 controls).
Result
The onset of T2DM begins from 15 years and continues further to maximum T2DM subjects to the age of 50 (76% of T2DM). High BMI and WHR, high blood pressure leading to early onset of hypertension, early mortality due to T2DM (7% of T2DM is above 75 years and 3% of T2DM has 20 years duration of onset) and high hyperglycemic NIP were the few outcomes of this research.
Conclusion
There is a strong association of PPAR γ, PPAR α and PPAR δ genes on the susceptibility of T2DM in late onset but not with the early onset of T2DM subjects in North Indian Population: Dual association of PPAR γ was observed with its genotype G/G (Ala/Ala) favoring protection against T2DM and genotype C/C (Pro/Pro) favoring susceptibility to T2DM. Association of intron7 polymorphism of PPAR α and +T294C polymorphism of PPAR δ on the susceptibility to T2DM requires further analysis."

The goal of our study was to determine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and all its components, in a population of postmenopausal women aged over 45 years, consecutively accessed to our Heart Station, during 2014, for their first cardiac examination,furthermore to estimate their cardiovascular risk and the achievement of target blood values of main risk factors, according to current Guidelines.
Methods
We screened 1257 postmenopausal women. MetS was assessed according to the National-Cholesterol-Education-Program-Adult-Treatment-Panel III definition. Cardiovascular risk was calculated by the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (<65 years).
Results
MetS was assessed on 834 women (66.4%). Prevalence of each component was: hypertension on 767 women (91.9%), central obesity 758 women (90.9%), low high-density lipoproteins cholesterol (HDLc) increased levels 612 women (73.3%), high triglyceride levels 428 women (51.3%), glucose levels higher than 110mg/dl or diabetes 404 women (48.5%). Cardiovascular risk was moderate until 65 years, but it increases after. Metabolic control in postmenopausal women was poor for glucose, only 82 women (9.8%) presented glucose levels lower than 110mg/dl, it was better for systolic blood pressure, that was normal in 564 women (67.6%) and worse for lipid levels.
Conclusion
The prevalence of metabolic syndrome in our population of postmenopausal women is high. Hypertension and central obesity are the more common components. The cardiovascular risk is moderate-high, the achievement of target values for glycemic and lipid levels is unsatisfactory, while systolic blood pressure is enough well controlled but however it is mandatory to improve this goal. An early MetS diagnosis and an early educational intervention are useful to decrease cardiovascular risk of postmenopausal women affected by metabolic syndrome."

Diabetes is one of the biggest problems in healthcare systems and kills many people every year. Diabetes management is impossible when only utilizing medication. So, patients must be educated to manage their diabetes. This study aims to assess the effect of education by telephone and short message service on empowering patients with type 2 diabetes (primary outcome).
Materials and methods
A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in the Urmia diabetes association in Iran. Sixty six participants with definitive diagnosis of type 2 diabetes entered into the study. Patients with secondary health problems were excluded. Patients were selected by simple random sampling then allocated into intervention (n=33) and control (n=33) groups. The intervention group received an educational text message daily and instructive phone calls three days a week for three months along with usual care. The Diabetes Empowerment Scale (DES) with confirmed validity and reliability was used for collecting data. Data was analyzed using SPSS V6.1. Independent t-test, paired t-test and chi-square were used to analyze the data.
Results
The empowerment of the intervention group compared with the control group significantly improved after three months of distance education (p<0.00, EF=1. 16).
Conclusions
The study findings show that the distance education has a significant effect on empowering patients with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, using distance education along with other diabetes management intervention is highly effective and should be part of the care in diabetes treatment."

Localized disease has a better prognosis especially in earlier stages I and II. In addition most patients with more advanced localized stage III disease are expected to survive with a combination of surgery and adjuvant treatments. Progress in treatment of metastatic disease has led to median survivals exceeding 2 years and a minority of oligometastatic patients may survive even longer or be cured with multimodality therapy. Besides stage of the disease few prognostic factors are available to guide informative discussions with patients or guide therapeutic decisions. One area of research that may provide information in this direction is comorbidity conditions of the metabolic syndrome spectrum. Despite a significant body of literature investigating elements of the metabolic syndrome such as obesity and diabetes in isolation as risk and prognostic factors in colorectal cancer, a more restricted amount of research is dealing with the combination of these two factors as prognosticators of colorectal cancer. This paper will discuss published data on these factors and specifically their combination in the prognosis of colorectal cancer and will address some of their pathogenesis and therapy implications."

abstract = "Background
Type 2 diabetes is a global problem with significant morbidity and healthcare costs. In this study, we aimed to determine the 10-year trend of diabetes, prediabetes and their risk factors in the adult urban population of Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS).
Materials and methods
In this cross-sectional study, we included all patients above 20 years of age who were registered in phases 1 and 4 of TLGS. Each phase had a 3-year duration. 4580 patients were recruited in each phase (916 patients in each age-group, including 3772 males and 5145 females). Random cluster sampling was used in phase 1 and convenience sampling was used in phase 4. Diabetes and glucose tolerance status were determined according to the 1991 criteria of the American Diabetes Association. In our five age groups, risk factors were compared, which included physical activity, waist circumference, body mass index, education, smoking, lipid profile and family history. Exclusion criteria were placement of an individual in the same age-group in the two phases and pregnancy. We calculated the prevalence of diabetes and dysglycemia in each age-group. Age-specific prevalence rates were determined. Prevalence of risk factors in the two phases were compared using chi-square test and Student t-test. Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze the variables with non-normal distribution.
Results
In this study, 3976 individuals were recruited in phase 1 (2308 women and 1668 men; female to male ratio 1.38) and 4941 individuals were recruited in phase 4 (2837 women and 2104 men; female to male ratio 1.35). Prevalence of prediabetes in all age groups (except for the 30–39 years age-group) were increased in phase 4 compared to phase 1. Prevalence of known diabetes in all age groups were increased in phase 4 compared to phase 1, yet, the increase was significant only in the 30–39 and 60–69 years age groups (1.8% vs. 0.7% and 19.0% vs. 10.2%, respectively). Newly diagnosed diabetes was decreased in all age groups in phase 4, except for the 60–69 years age-group. The incidence of newly diagnosed diabetes in the 60–69 years age-group was significantly higher in phase 4 compared to the similar age-group of phase 1 (15.2% vs. 11.8%; p<0.001). Physical activity, body mass index, waist circumference (central obesity), general obesity, smoking (except for the 30–39 and 40–49 years age groups), and level of education were significantly higher in phase 4 compared to phase 1. Marriage rates were significantly lower in phase 4 compared to phase 1 across all studied age groups.
Conclusion
We observed an increasing trend in the prevalence of diabetes over a 10-year period in TLGS. This is an accordance with estimates ​​in this field and highlights the need for education, prevention, treatment and control of diabetes. We also found increased rates of central and general obesity, smoking and divorce along with decreased marriage rates, which should be considered by the healthcare policymakers and state health officials as significant risk factors of diabetes."

Proinflammatory mediators can be related to obesity and induce insulin- resistance in adipose tissue. Signaling pathways of transcription factors, particularly NF-κB signaling, are involved in insulin-sensitivity. In addition, the crosstalk between M1-M2 macrophage polarizing plays an essential role in insulin resistance by switching from an M1 to an M2 phenotype and also activation of transcription factors such as NF-κB and AP1.

Non-enzymatic glycation impairs the structural and functional characterstics of human serum albumin (HSA) native conformation. Prolonged hyperglycemia causes cross links formation in proteins that may contribute to progression of diabetic complications.
Methods
HSA (20μM) was incubated with different concentration of d-glucose100, 200, 300 and 400mg/dl for a period of 40 days in phosphate buffer saline (20mM pH=7.4) under sterile conditions. Incubated samples were extensively dialyzed and structural changes were analyzed by far and near UV circular dichroism spectra measurement. Fructosamine assay with nitroblue tetrazolonium was performed to confer isomerisation between glucose and protein. Aggregations of the glycated product (AGEs) formed during reduction of nitrobluetetrazolium dye were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy. Crosslinks aggregates were investigated by in-situ Congo red binding assay. Red blood cells hemolysis test was performed to decipher the antioxidant activity of albumin samples.
Results
Fructosamine content in glycated albumin demonstrates the non-enzymatic addition of glucose to HSA and confers the formation of monoformazone (marker of glycation). Significant changes were found in the glycated samples of HSA compared to native (unmodified) in far and near UV circular dichroism. Transmission electron microscopy, Congo red staining, showed the formation of crosslink's aggregated mass in glycated HSA. Glycation of albumin reduces the antioxidant capacity of native albumin confirmed by red blood cells hemolysis test.
Conclusion
The finding of present study brings new evidences on the detrimental alterations of on albumin vital functions after non-enzymatic glycation with glucose. These results may emphasize the albumin associated diabetic complications under glycemic range of diabetes mellitus."

abstract = "Summary
Non-alcoholic fatty liver means the presence of hepatosteatosis without significant alcohol consumption; it is strongly associated with obesity and metabolic disorder like type 2 diabetes and dyslipideamia. NASH may progress to advanced stages of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. Increased body mass index and viral genotype contribute to steatosis in chronic hepatitis. The sonographic features of NAFLD include the presence of bright hepatic echotexture deep attenuation, and vascular blurring either singly or in combination. Dyslipidemia in patients with NAFLD is atherogenic in nature and it is characterized by increased levels of serum triglycerides and decreased levels of HDL cholesterol. Statins are potent lipid-lowering agents which decrease LDL cholesterol by 20–60%, decrease triglycerides by 10–33% and increase HDL cholesterol by 5–10% for the patients with NAFLD."

abstract = "Aims
To determine an association between hs-CRP and metabolic control/diabetic chronic vascular complications (DCVCCxs) in the patients with type 2 diabetes (DM). In addition, the possibility of using hs-CRP levels to predict risk of DCVCCxs will also be validated.
Methods
This cohort study randomly enrolled 608 patients with DM during the 2007–2008 study period. We also recorded basic laboratory findings at baseline and at one year, to include fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and hs-CRP.
Results
Logistic regressions of odds ratios between hs-CRP and DCVCCxs (coronary arterial disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic peripheral neuropathy) showed significant correlations, except for cerebrovascular disease, as follows 0.2 (0.11–0.38), 0.09 (0.01–0.77), 0.06 (0.02–0.16), 0.31 (0.12–0.82), and 0.17 (0.07–0.43), respectively. Linear regression for changes in hs-CRP were significantly correlated with HbA1c (r=0.38), fasting plasma glucose (r=0.40), triglyceride (r=0.20), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r=0.12), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r=−0.12). No correlation was found for total cholesterol (r=0.06). Based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the cut-off points for hs-CRP levels for prediction of DCVCCxs were 2.89, 2.25, 2.10, 2.25, and 2.82mg/L, for coronary arterial disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic peripheral neuropathy, respectively.
Conclusions
Our data showed that DCVCCxs were associated with hs-CRP in patients with DM. The cut-off point for hs-CRP can be used to predict association with DCVCCxs. Well-controlled metabolic components in diabetic patients, especially HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, and triglyceride may reduce the level of hs-CRP."

Patients utilize a variety of sources to learn about their condition. This study assessed the association of these resources with patient knowledge, adherence, and physiologic outcomes.
Methods
Adults with Type 2 diabetes recruited at an outpatient clinic in Pune, India provided IRB-approved consent and completed surveys measuring diabetes knowledge, self-management, and educational resource utilization. Lab values were obtained from the patient’s medical record. Statistical analysis was conducted in SPSS to determine the association between educational resources and outcomes.
Results
We enrolled 82 patients with a mean age of 58.3 years. The most commonly used resource was books/pamphlets. The use of television and books/pamphlets as sources of information was significantly associated with greater knowledge and self-management. Use of books and pamphlets and peers with diabetes was associated with lower fasting and postprandial blood glucose. Regression analyses controlling for age, gender, and years with diabetes revealed that use of newspapers and magazines, books and pamphlets, and television were predictors of overall diabetes knowledge and nutrition knowledge. The use of television as a source of information was a predictor of the hours exercised per week.
Conclusions
Resources such as books and pamphlets, newspapers and magazines, and television are common ways that people with diabetes learn about their medical conditions. The use of television as a source of information predicted the greatest number of positive outcomes among patients, followed by use of books and pamphlets. These methods should be further explored in order to understand how their benefit may be maximized for patients."

Vitamin D has recently been given a lot of attention for its role in controlling insulin secretion. Many studies have spoken of its role in weight management, blood sugar control and many other metabolic variables.
Patient and methods
In a randomized double-blind clinical trial, 210 people with vitamin D deficiency were randomly allocated into two groups receiving vitamin D (50,000 units per week) or placebo for 8 weeks.
Results
Vitamin D levels were significantly increased in the group receiving vitamin D supplementation (13.7±5.2 unit increase versus 0.8±2.8). The increased levels of vitamin D lead to significant changes in fasting insulin levels (6.8±8.1 unit reduction versus 2.3±3.7), a 2-h insulin (31.1±34.9 unit reduction versus 4.5±24.6) and Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) indices.
Conclusion
Correction of vitamin D deficiency leads to increased insulin sensitivity that was significantly able to maintain glucose in the normal range with lower levels of insulin."

A secondary objective was to investigate if the progression of diabetes-related complications had any affect on the fear of falling. This was a study of 38 patients enrolled at the Foot Center of New York. Prospective subjects were recruited if they reported an International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code consistent with diabetes using electronic medical records, expressed a desire to participate, conformed with the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study (they were over 18 years of age and considered alert and thereby able to consent to the study), and provided informed consent. A total of 38 patients were enrolled in the study. Most of the participants were male and African American. The mean number of podiatric manifestations in the group was 4.43 (SD=62.35). The mean HbA1c level for the group was 8.23% (SD=1.94). Several predictors of podiatric manifestations were examined in the study, including mean MFES (Modified Falls Efficiency Scale) score, age, concurrent treatments for neuropathy, and HbA1c levels. Simple correlational analyses revealed that there was no correlation between HbA1c and the number of podiatric manifestations. Several follow-up regression analyses were performed to assess the ability of HbA1c to predict podiatric manifestations when controlling for individual parameters such age and duration of diabetes. HbA1c did not predict number of podiatric manifestations after controlling for age and diabetes duration, age alone or diabetes duration alone. The study did find that patients receiving neuropathy drugs reported lower MFES scores (notably, lower MFES scores are associated with a higher risk of falling). HbA1c levels of patients receiving neuropathy drugs did not differ significantly from the HbA1c levels of patients not receiving neuropathy drugs. The podiatric manifestations of patients with diabetes in East Harlem, where this study was carried out, are wide-ranging and include nail and skin disorders, which are both recognized as common precursors to infections and amputations. Predictive tools could help reduce the economic burden of diabetes. This study assessed the ability of HbA1c to predict the total number of podiatric manifestations in diabetic patients. In the end, HbA1c was not a good predictor of the number of podiatric manifestations. The weak correlation between HbA1c levels and the total number of podiatric manifestations in this study might be due to the small sample size. Future studies, ideally involving a larger sample size, are needed to more accurately assess the potential of HbA1c for predicting lower extremity complications."

This study was designed to assess the prevalence of diabetes in people aged over 20 years in Ahvaz, Iran.
Materials and methods
The study population was chosen by cluster sampling. A checklist included: age, sex, weight, height, blood pressure, waist circumference, educational level, smoking status and previous history of diabetes was completed for each patient. Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) ≥126mg/dl and/or oral hypoglycemic treatment and/or insulin consumption was defined as diabetes, FPG=100–125mg/dl as Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG) and FPG <100mg/dl as normal.
Results
Study population was 944 persons. Mean age of population was 42.2±14 years. Diabetes was detected in 15.1% of population. Only 40.4% of cases were aware of their disease. Diabetes was detected in 14.7% of female and 15.7% of male participants. Diabetes was related to age, waist circumference, family history of diabetes, hypertension, waist to hip ratio, educational level, marital status, serum triglyceride, cholesterol and body mass index (BMI) in both genders. But by using logistic regression analysis, age, family history of diabetes, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, and marital status had significant effect on diabetes.
Conclusion
This study showed that using FPG criteria or current medication 15.1% of this population had diabetes and about 60% of patients were unaware of their disease. Age, hypertension, family history of diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia and marital status are the risk factors of diabetes in Ahvaz population. IFG have high prevalence and diabetes screening should be intensified in this population."

Ramadan fasting is one of the five pillars of Islam. People with diabetes are exempted from fasting according to Islamic rules. However, many people with diabetes wish to fast. Physicians are asked frequently by their patients about their ability to fast and the possible impact of fasting on their glycaemic control. Studies about the effect of Ramadan on people with insulin-treated diabetes are scarce. This review aims to provide clinicians with the best recommendations for their patients with insulin-treated diabetes who wish to fast.
Methods
Four databases (Medline, EMBASE, Scopus and PubMed) were searched using the following MeSH terms and keywords: “insulin dependent diabetes mellitus”, “type 1 diabetes mellitus”, ‘Ramadan’ “and” “fasting”. In addition, a hand search of key journals and reference lists was performed. Sixteen full text articles were selected for review and critical analysis.
Results
All of the included studies except one found improvement or no change in glycaemic control parameters during Ramadan fasting. The incidence of major complications were negligible. Minor hypoglycaemic events were reported in some studies but did not adversely affect fasting. Postprandial hyperglycaemia was a major concern in other studies. However, the incidence of severe hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis were trivial.
Conclusion
Ramadan fasting is feasible for insulin dependent diabetic patient who wish to fast. Clinicians should advise their patients about the importance of adequate glycaemic control before Ramadan and frequent glucose monitoring during fasting. Certain types of Insulin seem to be more beneficial than other."

abstract = "Background
Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is associated with obesity, insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome (MetS). In non-diabetic populations, features of metabolic obesity (MO) are observed in a minority of normal-weight (NW) subjects. The cardiometabolic status of metabolically obese but normal-weight (MONW) individuals has not yet been phenotyped in T2DM.
Patients and methods
Prevalence and features of MONW were analyzed in 1244 T2DM patients, in whom MONW was identified as a BMI <25.0 and a MetS score ≥3/5. Among NW (n=262; 21%), those without MetS (n=152; NW-MetS[−]) were compared to NW-MetS[+] (n=110; i.e. 42% of NW and 9% of all T2DM).
Results
There were no differences between groups in age; gender; diabetes duration; smoking; BP; and LDL-C. NW-MetS[+] had higher BMI; waist; fat mass; visceral fat; liver steatosis and HbA1c, and lower insulin sensitivity. Non-right-handedness was twice-higher (18%) in NW-MetS[−]. NW-MetS[+] had higher apoB100 and triglycerides, and lower HDL-C and LDL size. Macroangiopathy was present in 39% of NW-MetS[+] vs. 22% of NW-MetS[−], as coronary (23% vs. 14%) or peripheral artery disease (14% vs. 5%) and TIA/stroke (15% vs. 7%). Microangiopathy was present in 54% of NW-MetS[+] vs. 32% of NW-MetS[−], as retinopathy (25% vs. 13%); neuropathy (29% vs. 18%); and albuminuria (39% vs. 20%).
Conclusions
MONW among T2DM represents a significant minority (about 1 in 10). Their cardiometabolic phenotype deserves attention due to multiple comorbidities, including a twice-higher prevalence of micro-/macrovascular damage in patients wrongly perceived at lower risk due to normal BMI. Unexpectedly, non-right-handedness was over-represented among metabolically healthy patients."

The study was designed for comparing the efficacy and cost effectiveness of Pregabalin and Duloxetine used in Diabetic Neuropathic Pain.
Methods
The prospective interventional 6 month study was conducted in a diabetic clinic of a 500 bedded tertiary care hospital in South India. The subjects having diagnosed with diabetic neuropathy and not treated with Pregabalin and Duloxetine or any other drugs of its class were selected. The data were collected using NPS and Neuro QoL questionnaires. The cost of both drugs used in the study was calculated as the mean of the price of 3 leading common brands of those drugs. The comparative efficacy was calculated by comparing the mean difference produced by both drugs in NPS and QoL scores. The cost effectiveness were calculated by ICER ratio.
Results
The results have shown a significant improvement in the mean difference of NPS and Neuro QoL scores of both Pregabalin (p=<0.001) and Duloxetine (p=<0.001) before and after the therapy, the Duloxetine dominates over Pregabalin in both. The mean cost of Pregabalin for 3 months therapy was found to be INR 668.7 and that for Duloxetine was INR 756. Duloxetine showed a better effect but more expensive. ICER ratio was calculated and found that a cost of INR 61.47 per extra QoL gained by Duloxetine.
Conclusion
The study have revealed that, both drugs are found to be effective.On conducting cost effective analysis, a significant better improvement in QoL of patients was obtained by Duloxetine with comparatively mild increase in the price."

Obesity and being overweight is the most powerful risk factor accounting for 80–90% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The epidemic of obesity is driving the diabetes epidemic to alarming levels and primary care is becoming an important setting for obesity management in T2DM in India. Yet many primary care providers feel ill-equipped or inadequately supported to address obesity in patients with diabetes. This article reviews the most recent and strongest evidence-based strategies that may aid physicians in management of obesity in patients with T2DM in primary care.
Material and methods
A systematic literature search of MEDLINE using the search terms Obesity, Obesity in T2DM, weight loss and Primary Care was conducted. The American Diabetes Association, National Institute for Health, National Institute of Health and Excellence (NICE), Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) and World Health Organization websites were also searched. Most studies in this area are observational in design with few randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Articles and studies involving meta-analysis or RCTs were preferred over other types.
Results and conclusion
Effective weight management treatment in T2DM patient can be implemented in the primary care setting. Evidence based individualized lifestyle and pharmacologic measures supported by behavioral intervention and counseling with appropriate and informed surgical referrals has the potential to improve the success of weight management within primary care."

Physical function is a determinant of survival in chronic diseases, however, little is known about functional capacity (FC) and self-reported health status of patients with type-2 diabetes (T2D). This study investigated the relationship between FC and health related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with T2D.
Materials and methods
This cross-sectional survey recruited 150 patients with T2D from a Nigerian university teaching hospital using purposive sampling technique. Socio-demographic and physical characteristics were assessed. FC and HRQoL including physical and mental health component summary (PCS and MCS) were assessed using the six minute walk test (6MWT) and Short-Form (SF-12) questionnaire respectively. Maximum oxygen consumption (VO2 max) was estimated, pre and post 6MWT cardiovascular parameters and fasting blood glucose (FBG) were assessed. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Alpha level was set at p<0.05.
Results
There were 83(55.3%) women, means of age and FBG of participants were 64.2±8.7years and 7.4±2.4mmol/L respectively. The means of 6-min walk distance (6-MWD) and estimated VO2 max were 341.55±41.82m and 9.2±0.7mL/kg/min respectively. Significant differences were found between pre and post HR (t=−44.71; p=0.001), SBP (t=−38.38; p=0.001) and DBP (t=−38.58; p=0.001) following 6MWT. The means of PCS and MCS of HRQoL were 48.67±5.51 and 58.39±2.86 respectively. There were significant correlations between FC and each of PCS (r=0.678; p=0.001) and MCS (r=0.211; p=0.009).
Conclusion
Patients with T2D demonstrated low functional capacity and reduced HRQoL. Significant relationship exists between FC and physical and mental component summary of HRQoL. Exercise intervention to improve FC and HRQoL were recommended."

Insulin resistance (IR) a state of decreased sensitivity of target tissues to insulin is suspected usually in obese so can be overlooked in normal weight subjects thus it is important to find optimal method of IR assessment in clinical practice.
Aims
(1)Assessment if IR can be reliably and easily diagnosed by any of surrogate methods: HOMA, HOMA 2, QUICKI and Matsuda index, using data from routinely performed tests.(2)Retrospective estimation of IR resistance incidence among female patients with various BMI, hospitalized for various reasons, in order to confirm need for IR assessment.
Methods
HOMA, HOMA2, QUICKI, Matsuda index were calculated using data obtained from medical history of 130 female subjects – patients of the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases, in whom oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with parallel insulin concentrations assessment was performed.
Results
IR correlated positively with body mass index (BMI) in the entire study group, regardless which of four analyzed IR indices was used. Insulin resistance occurred in the obese as well as in normal weight and underweight subjects. The incidences of IR in the study group varied, depending upon chosen method and adopted cut-off values.
Conclusions
The need for quantitative assessment of IR in clinical practice is apparent. Proper selection of the best method of IR assessment remains a problem. HOMA appears the method of first choice for clinical use. There is an urgent need to establish universal or, at least, national standard cut-off values for IR, to introduce IR assessment in clinical practice."

abstract = "Background
The decreased number and impaired functions of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) may associate with cardiovascular disease (CV) including atherosclerosis. However, the role of vistafin in regulation of angiogenic EPC subset maturation in T2DM patients without known atherosclerosis is still not fully understood.
The aim of the study
To investigate an association of serum vistafin level and number of circulating EPCs in T2DM patients beyond known CV disease.
Methods
This case–control observational investigation was evolved 54 subjects with T2DM and 35 healthy volunteers. The flow cytometry was used for predictably distinguishing cell subsets, which depend on expression of CD45, CD34, CD14, Tie-2, and VEGFR2. Biomarkers were measured at baseline of the study.
Results
All T2DM patients were divided depending median of vistafin level (5.88ng/mL) in to two cohorts with low vistafin level (<5.88ng/mL; n=29) and high vistafin level (≥5.88ng/mL; n=25) respectively. Logistic regression analysis has shown that visfatin, hs-CRP, age and BMI were the best variables in the prediction of EPC number labeled as CD14+CD309+ and CD14+CD309+Tie2+ cells. After adjustment of the model to age and BMI elevated visfatin level remained the best predictor for both CD14+CD309+ and CD14+CD309+Tie2+ EPCs (OR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.88–0.95; P=0.001 and OR 0.90, 95% CI: 0.87–0.96; P=0.001 respectively).
Conclusion
We found that elevated level of vistafin was an independent predictor for declined numerous of non-classical EPCs labeled as CD14+CD309+ and CD14+CD309+Tie2+, whereas CD34+ subsets of EPCs did not associate with vistafin level in T2DM individuals."

The efficacy of insulin therapy in diabetes depends on proper storage and injection technique. The purpose of this study was to assess the practice of insulin administration among diabetes patients in a tertiary care center.
Materials and methods
This observational study was done in Endocrinology department of a tertiary care center during April–June 2015. The consecutive patients using insulin for at least three months by either syringe or pen were recruited. All of them underwent a survey by the questionnaire which focused on key insulin injection parameters.
Results
One hundred and sixty eight (74.67%) patients were storing insulin vials properly. The thigh was the most common site of insulin injection and 209(92.89%) study participants were rotating at the injection sites. Only 48.57% (34/70) subjects were mixing insulin properly before injection. The practice of hand washing and the cleaning of the injection site was practiced by 158(70%) & 171(76.44%) subjects respectively. One hundred and fifty six (69%) patients were injecting with the proper skin fold and 123(55%) subjects were injecting insulin at 90° angle. The majority of patients (91%) were throwing the needle and syringes directly into the garbage and public drainage system.
Conclusions
There was a significant gap between the insulin administration guidelines and current insulin injection practice. The diabetic education and counseling about proper insulin injection techniques should be provided to all diabetic subjects."

The metabolic syndrome developed after kidney transplantation is the result of several factors which are identical with the risk factors in normal population, however, also some factors typical for the transplanted patients—especially the effects of immunosuppressive therapy.
Material and methods
In the groupof 268 patients after kidney transplantation, which had no type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus before transplantation, we identified patients with metabolic syndrome(based on IDF criteria), 12 months from the kidney transplantation. In all patients, we recorded the following parameters: age at the time of transplantation, type of immunosuppression, waist measure, the value of triacylglycerols, the value of HDL cholesterol, presence of arterial hypertension, andthe value of glycaemia in fasting state (or presence of diabetes mellitus). The groupof patients was divided into the control group and the group of patients with metabolic syndrome.
Results
The average age of patients was 46.1±11.6years. The control group included 149 patients (55.6%),and we identified the metabolicsyndromein 119patients (44.4%). The patients with metabolicsyndrome were significantly older (P<0.0001), had significantly larger waist (both the entiregroup and the males andfemales) P<0.0001.The femaleswith metabolic syndrome had significantly lower value of HDL—cholesterol (P=0.0013), and significantly higher number of patients with metabolic syndrome had hyperglycaemia in fasting state or diabetes mellitus (P=0.0006).
Conclusion
By controlling the weight and waist, we may identify the risk patients for development of metabolic syndrome after kidney transplantation."

In this context, hyperglycaemia, oxidant stress, and inflammation are key factors that contribute in CV events and disease in type1 and type 2 DM, even when metabolic control was optimal and/or intensive glycemic control was implemented. It has been suggested that the effect of poor metabolic control or even transient episodes of hyperglycemia in DM associates in particularly with worsening ability of endogenous vasoreparative systems that are mediated epigenetic changes in several cells (progenitor cells, stem cells, mononuclears, immune cells), and thereby lead to so called “vascular glycemic memory” or “metabolic memory”. Both terms are emphasized the fact that prior glucose control has sustained effects that persist even after return to more usual glycemic control. The mechanisms underlying the cellular “metabolic memory” induced by high glucose remain unclear. The review is discussed pathophysiology and clinical relevance of “metabolic” memory phenomenon in DM. The role of oxidative stress, inflammation, and epigenetics in DM and its vascular complications are highlighted. The effects of several therapeutic approaches are discussed."

The health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a matter of concern in elderly people with chronic diseases. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of obesity, hypertension and diabetes on HRQoL among elderly.
Methods
A population based cross sectional study was conducted with 750 representative sample of elderly people aged 60–90 years in Babol, the northern Iran. The demographic data and the measurement of blood pressure and other anthropometric measures were collected. The validated short form (SF-36) questionnaire was used to assess the HRQoL. A multiple linear regression model was applied to assess the impact of obesity, abdominal obesity, hypertension and diabetes on QoL.
Results
The mean age (SD) of participants was 68.0±7.6 and 67.7±7.9 years for men and women respectively. Diabetes exerted the most negative effect on QoL score (adjusted coefficient=−9.2, 95% CI: −11.7, −6.5 points) followed by abdominal obesity and hypertension. Whereas a combination of three conditions was associated with a greater significant reduction in QoL scores in both sexes(adjusted coefficient=−14.5, 95% CI: −19.0, −9.9 points). However, the negative influence of obesity and hypertension on QoL was significant only in women.
Conclusion
Most components of the QoL is affected by diabetes, obesity and hypertension particularly in women. Diabetes alone or in combination with other conditions has a negative influence in both sexes with greater effect in women. These findings justify further professional support to compensate the negative influences chronic conditions on health-related QoL especially for older obese diabetic women."

High pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and excessive pregnancy weight gain lead to higher incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Aim of the study was to assess the effects of initial BMI and pregnancy weight gain on development of GDM in a rural Sri Lankan population. It was also hypothesized that these effects could be more pronounced in shorter mothers.
Methods
A case-control study was conducted at two rural hospitals in Sri Lanka. A case was defined as a pregnant mother admitted for the completion of pregnancy and diagnosed to have GDM (n=99). A similar group of mothers without GDM were recruited as controls (n=336). Data were collected through health records and direct interviews.
Results
Mean age of GDM and non-GDM mothers were 32.8 years 28.1 years, respectively. High pre-pregnancy BMI was a significant risk for GDM, with a rising trend with increasing BMI. In contrast to underweight mothers, the risk increases from normal weight [odds ratio (OR)=6.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.2–19.4, p<0.01], overweight (OR=17.1, 95% CI 5.8–49.9, p<0.01) and to obese (OR=32.4, 95% CI 10.0–104.5, p<0.01). There was no significant difference in weight gain across mother's height groups. Height or leg length did not show an association with GDM. Family history of diabetes and past GDM were associated with GDM. GDM mothers had higher likelihood for cesarian deliveries, and babies with higher birth weight.
Conclusion
The pre-pregnancy BMI was the most important modifiable risk factor for GDM, and it should be the main preventive measure."

Exercise is an integral part of diabetes care. In Iranian women with type II diabetes, we compared the effects of supervised group exercise therapy with the effects of home-based exercise therapy on health-related quality of life (HRQOL), anthropometric parameters, glycaemic control and lipid profile.
Materials and methods
One hundred and two diabetic women were randomised to supervised and home-based groups.
Methods
Over 12 weeks, participants received supervised group-exercise therapy or a home-based exercise-therapy program. During the intervention, they were assessed three times: at baseline, and at weeks 6 and 12. Generalized Estimating Equation models were used to examine the associations between the type of exercise-therapy program and changes over time in anthropometric and biochemical outcomes, and in HRQOL scales of SF36 questionnaire.
Results
Relative to home-based group, supervised group improved significantly regarding role-physical, general health, mean body weight and body mass index from baseline to week 12 (p=0.01). Their reduction in mean body-fat mass from baseline to week 6 (p=0.04) was greater. Similarly, their role-physical, general health and role-emotional improved significantly during the intervention (p<0.05). From baseline to the twelfth week, the HbA1c level fell significantly (p<0.05) in both groups.
Conclusions
Supervised group-exercise therapy was more effective than home-based exercise therapy in improving HRQOL and body composition in diabetic women. However, home-based exercise therapy also produced significant improvements in glycaemic control, body composition and lipid profile. Whether in a supervised or home-based setting, the exercise intervention can therefore be effective in improving health outcomes in diabetic patients."

abstract = "Aims
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic and chronic disease which is characterized by hyperglycemia, and that is the major causes of various micro and macrovascular complications. Asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA), formed by the hydrolysis of proteins containing methylated arginine residues, is an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which oxidize l-arginine to citruline and nitric oxide (NO), related to hyperinsulinaemia and hyperlipidaemia. Apelin is a recently discovered peptide, present in a number of tissues and play role in insulin sensitivity improvement. In this study, our aim was to determine the levels of apelin and ADMA with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in type 2 diabetic patients with or without vascular complications.
Methods
This study included (a total of) 59 diabetic patients. Of the patients, 30 were diabetic with complications, and 29 without complications. In serum samples obtained from the patients, serum ADMA and apelin levels were measured with Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method.
Results
Our study totally enrolled 59 patients in two groups. No significant differences were found in sex, age, HbA1c and glucose levels among groups. Apelin and ADMA levels of group with complications were lower than those of group without complications, but no statistically significant difference of apelin and ADMA levels (p>0.05).
Conclusion
The results of this study have been showed no statistically significant relationship present between ADMA–apelin levels and complications of T2DM. Further studies involving larger patients populations and healthy controls should be done to clarify the pathogenetic significance of apelin and ADMA in diabetic vascular complications."

abstract = "Background and aim
Interleukin (IL)-18 is a proinflammatory cytokine secreted from mononuclear cells. Serum concentration of IL-18 is a strong predictor of death in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Recent studies have shown that microinflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy as well as of cardiovascular diseases. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that the serum level of IL-18 is a common predictor of nephropathy and atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Materials and methods
69 diabetic patient that have documented file in two centers (Ali asghar hospital and dialysis center of Imam ali hospital) had selected. 32 patients with type 2 nephropathic diabetes and 37 age- and sex-matched control subjects with type 2 diabetes that haven’t any sign and symptom of nephropathy were enrolled.then take 5 ml blood from peripheral veins. Patients with positive CRP were excluded(2 patients in control group and 1 patient in case group). We assessed measured serum IL-18 levels in all patients.
Findings
Serum IL-18 levels were significantly elevated in patients with type 2 diabetes with nephropathy as compared with control subjects (serum IL-18 261.29±20.25 vs. 167.20±13.48 pg/ml, P<0.001. the all patients in case control have upper level of serum IL-18 vs the control group.
Discussion and conclusions
Serum levels of IL-18 in nephropathic patient significantly rise and Serum levels of IL-18 might be a predictor factor of progression of diabetic nephropathy."

abstract = "Aims
Tissue hypoxia is an important contributor to diabetic complications. Glycation of hemoglobin (Hb) and obesity are major determinant of oxygen saturation (SpO2) in blood. Hence, the present study was planned to evaluate the effect of obesity on SpO2 in a wide range of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in ambulatory type 2 diabetic patients.
Material and methods
A cohort of 60 subjects irrespective of diabetic status were recruited and clustered in group I (HbA1c <6.5) and group II (HbA1c ≥6.5) depending on HbA1c. Anthropometry and routine biochemical parameters were measured. HbA1c (%) were estimated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) respectively. SpO2 (%) levels were measured by pulse oximetry. Pearson correlation, bivariate regression and student ‘t’ test were used for statistical analysis.
Results
Blood concentration of HbA1c was <6.5 in 29 participants and ≥6.5 in 31 participants. Plasma fasting and post prandial glucose, HbA1c as well as Hb levels were significantly (p<0.50) higher in diabetics as compared to non diabetics. Waist circumference (WC) (r=−400; p=0.026) and body mass index (BMI) (r=−381; p=0.034) showed a significant negative correlation with SpO2 in diabetic patients. On adjusting HbA1c in group II, SpO2 was found to independently and inversely associated with WC (p=0.042) and BMI (p=0.049).
Conclusions
Obesity was found to be a strong independent contributor to reduction in oxygen carrying capacity in ambulatory type 2 diabetic subjects. However there is no effect of glycated Hb on SpO2 in the same population."

The increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and MetS related complications in the U.S. poses a serious public health burden. We aim to identify high risk groups at greatest risk of developing MetS in the U.S.
Methods
Using data from the 2001–2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), MetS prevalence among adults (age≥18) was stratified by sex, race/ethnicity and age to identify groups at greatest risk of MetS. Mutlivariate logistic regression models evaluated for predictors of MetS.
Results
Overall, the prevalence of MetS in the U.S. was 78 million during the study period. There was a greater prevalence of MetS in females compared to males (34.4% vs. 29.6%, p<0.001). Females had a 25% higher risk of MetS compared to males (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.18–1.32, p<0.001). Hispanics had a higher risk of MetS when compared to non-Hispanic whites (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.04–1.23, p<0.01). The prevalence of MetS increased with increasing age (age <40: 17.5% vs. age 40–49: 29.7% vs. age 50–59: 37.5% vs. age 60–69: 44.4% vs. age ≥70: 47.0%, p<0.001), and individuals age 70 and over were more than 5 times more likely to have MetS than those less than age 40 (OR, 5.12, 4.71–5.57, p<0.001)
Conclusions
The high prevalence of MetS in the U.S. affects females, Hispanics, and older individuals the greatest. The aging population and increasing Hispanic population further highlight the huge burden of disease MetS will place on the healthcare system in the U.S."

abstract = "Background
It has been documented that patients with metabolic syndrome (MS) and vascular complications have higher homocysteine levels. Hyperhomocysteinemia correlates with IR, increasing oxidative stress, which causes lesions of vascular endothelium leading to endothelial dysfunction, hypertension and atherosclerosis.
Objective
The objectives of the study were to examine homocysteine values, along with cardiovascular risk factors (lipid and apolipoprotein status, CRP, blood pressure), indicators of renal function (microalbuminuria/24h), glucose regulation and insulin resistance (glucose and insulin level, HbA1c, HOMA-IR, uric acid) and anthropometric parameters (BMI, WC, HC, WHR) in patients with and without MS as a correlation between homocysteine and MS factors.
Methods
The study included obese and overweight individuals, aged of 30–75 yrs. classified into two groups: with MS (n=35) and without MS (n=41).
Results
Patients with MS had increased WC, BMI, BP, glycaemia, HOMA-IR, TG, CRP, microalbuminuria, homocysteine and decreased HDL-C (p<0.05). Statistically significant difference between groups was found for WC, BMI, sBP and dBP, TG, HDL-C (p<0.01) and glycaemia, CRP, Apo B, HOMA-IR (p<0.05).

Dyslipidemia is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease and is a leading cause of mortality in developed and developing countries. This study was aimed to determine the prevalence of dyslipidemia and its risk factors in an urban group of Iranian adult population.
Methods
In this study, based on the criteria set by the National Cholesterol Education Program, the prevalence of dyslipidemia was evaluated in a population of 4737 people aged 45–69 years who participated in the second phase of an ophthalmology cohort study in Shahroud. Dyslipidemia prevalence was determined by age, sex, and risk factors of the disease; the findings were tested by using simple and multiple logistic regression.
Results
The prevalence of dyslipidemia was 66.5% (CI 95%: 64.4–68.6) in males, 61.3% (CI 95%: 59.5–63.2) in females, and 63.4% (CI 95%: 62.0–64.9%) in both sexes. The prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, low HDL-C, and high LDL-C, respectively, was 28.8%, 13.4%, 42.3%, and 13.4%, respectively. In multivariate logistic regression model, increase of age (for females), abdominal obesity, overweight and obesity, hypertension, and diabetes were associated with an increased odd of dyslipidemia.
Conclusion
The prevalence of dyslipidemia in middle-aged urban population in Iran is high, and with increasing age there is an increased risk of dyslipidemia. Hence, considering the growing trend of aging in Iran, there is need for taking special measures to deal with dyslipidemia as a health priority. Furthermore, the need for planning in order to reduce the risk of dyslipidemia and prevent its complications is greater than ever."

The aim of our study is to measure total Magnesium in pregnant women screened for GDM and to compare total magnesium between whom were diagnosed having GDM and those having normal pregnancy.
Methods
Our study is a prospective study involved 99 pregnant women referred to Maternity and Child Hospital Al Ahsa (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) for 100g Oral Glucose Tolerance test. All included pregnant women were in their 24–28 weeks of gestation with free past medical history and were free for any medicine. A 100-g Oral Glucose Tolerance (OGTT) with total plasma magnesium measurement were done to all included women. All patient were followed tell delivery.
Results
Among 99 patients enrolled in our study, GDM was diagnosed in 19 patients (19.2%). Fifteen patients have normal fasting glycaemia and were diagnosed having GDM on 100-g OGTT. Four patients have fasting glycaemia more than 126mg/dl (7mmol/l) confirming the diagnosis of GDM. Hypomagnesemia was confirmed in eight patients (8.08%). no one of them had GDM. The serum magnesium concentration in GDM women was lower that of normal pregnant women but the difference was not significant. (0.89±0.1 vs 0.92±0.2mmol/l, p=0.51). BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were not significantly different between the pregnant women who developed or not gestational diabetes.
Conclusion
In our study, the development of GDM cannot be explained by low total serum magnesium. The low total serum magnesium in patient diagnosed having GDM compared to whom free of GDM and the importance of magnesium in the genesis of insulin resistance should encourage more large trial to explain the exact role of magnesium in the pathophysiology of GDM."

The percent and distribution of body fat are important factors in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases. Our aim was to investigate common anthropometric indices in their relationship with body fat content.
Methods
In a cross-sectional study 1360 healthy individuals (580 men and 780 women) in a cluster sampling, from Ahvaz, Iran, body fat content (using bioelectrical impedance) and anthropometric measurements [weight, waist circumference, a body shape index, abdominal volume index, body adiposity index, conicity, body mass index, hip circumference, waist to hip ratio and waist to height ratio] was obtained. The ROC curve analysis was used to compare each index with body fat percent.
Results
Significant difference was found between men and women in all anthropometric parameters (p < 0.001). Women displayed higher percentages in the overweight and obese categories (33.6% vs. 32.9% and 26.4% vs. 22.1%, respectively). In both men and women, the strongest correlations were seen between body fat percent and BMI, AVI and WHtR (r>7.9 and p<0.001). BMI, WHtR and AVI in men and BAI, BMI and WHtR in women showed the most accuracy for estimating body fat percent, respectively.
Conclusion
All anthropometric parameters could predict body fat percent with relatively good power, however BMI, WHtR and AVI are more powerful predictors. Based on our findings, we suggest using the AVI and WHtR instead of other indexes, as they are better able to assess the accumulation of fat in the abdominal area and are able to more accurately assess body fat percent, which are indicators of chronic disease."

To compare the changes in various glycemic parameters in insulin-naïve type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients who were initiated on insulin glargine or insulin degludec in a real world setting.
Methods
Retrospective data were analyzed in consecutive type 2 DM patients in a real world setting, who failed oral therapy (at least 2 oral anti-diabetic drugs) and were initiated with either insulin glargine or insulin degludec. The parameters assessed were the changes in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, body weight, dose of Insulin and the total number of patient reported hypoglycemic episodes up to 6 months after initiation.
Result
At baseline, insulin glargine and insulin degludec groups were similar in terms of gender, age, weight, HbA1c and duration of diabetes. After 6 months follow up the change in HbA1c (−1.09 versus −1.45 P=0.124), change in FPG (−72.81mg/dl [−4mmol/L] versus −75.88mg/dl [−4.2mmol/L] P=0.755), and the change in body weight (+1.65 versus +0.85 P=0.082) were similar in glargine and degludec groups, respectively. Patients in insulin degludec group experienced significantly lesser patient reported hypoglycemic episodes (12 versus 40) and required significantly lesser dose (25.68Units versus 18.61Units per day; P=0.002) compared to insulin glargine. 41% of the patients reached HbA1C target of ≤7% with insulin glargine compared to 69% with insulin degludec within the specified time period.
Conclusion
Results from this real world analysis suggest that among type 2 DM patients who were initiated on insulin degludec as compared to insulin glargine may be associated with significantly lesser patient reported hypoglycemic episodes and lesser dose of insulin while achieving similar glycemic control. This study is however limited by the retrospective nature of the data collection."

Hyperglycemia induced oxidative stress is implicated as a contributor to the onset and progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its complications like diabetic nephropathy (DN). Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) is primarily involved in the neutralization of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by enzymatic conjugation with the scavenger peptide glutathione (GSH). Therefore, present study was aimed to evaluate the role of GST along with oxidative stress markers and their correlation in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus with and without nephropathy.
Methods
This study comprised of 300 participants divided into three groups of 100 each: healthy controls (HC), T2DM without complications and DN. Plasma GST, malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced GSH levels and ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) were estimated spectrophotometrically.
Results
Highest GST levels was observed in T2DM which was significantly higher (p<0.05) as compared to DN and HC. However, GSH and FRAP levels were found to be significantly lowest whereas MDA levels were significantly highest in DN as compared to T2DM and HC. GST showed a significant negative correlation with GSH, FRAP and positive correlation with MDA in both patients groups.
Conclusions
Highest activity of GST in T2DM might be as a compensatory mechanism in response to oxidative stress. GST is found to have significant negative association with decreased GSH. Altered redox milieu in DN collectively conspire to increase the risk of renal damage in T2DM."

Diabetic patients have higher incidences of cognitive impairment and hence they are more at the risk of developing AD. Some of the recent evidences have majorly stated the effects of insulin resistance in the disturbance of various biological processes and signaling pathways. Both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemic conditions contributes in dysfunctioning of cognitive abilities and functions. The present review summarizes the evidences which establish the possible links between the two pathologies on the account of molecular, biochemical and at histopathological level. The information regarding their interactions was collected from different databases and journals. The gathered information will clearly establish the link among the two pathologies and will be helpful in future for the development of drugs for Type 3 Diabetes."

The Metabolic Syndrome (MS) is characterized by a set of risk factors, which causes metabolic and inflammatory changes that increase vascular risk and may promote the development of atherosclerosis. Changes in lifestyle are related to obesity and associated diseases such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, MS and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Aims
This study aimed to evaluate the relationship of MS components and high sensitivity C Reactive Protein (hsCRP) in patients undergoing arteriography.
Methods
A group of patients undergoing arteriography was recruited in order we could evaluate the metabolic profile, levels of hsCRP and number of obstructions in the arteries.
Results
Most of our patients underwent arteriography are more likely to have hypertension, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, and central obesity, thus, MS is prevalent in this group. They also tend to exhibit higher values of hsCRP, lower values ​​for the estimative of the size of the LDL-c particle and higher number of obstruction in the arteries.
Conclusion
We may say that the improvement of the above parameters could reduce inflammation and oxidative stress and vascular damages what would extend life expectancy and quality of life of this group of patients."

To assess the relationship between marijuana use, cigarette smoking and metabolic syndrome among adults in the United States who reported they use marijuana or cigarettes in comparison to non-marijuana and non-cigarette users.
Method
We conducted multiple logistic regression analyses using data from the 2011–2012 United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to estimate relationships between cardio-metabolic risk factors and increasing years of smoking cigarette or marijuana use. Statistical adjustments were made for both demographic and endogenous factors related to recreational substance use.
Results
Each year increase in marijuana use was significantly associated with increased odds of metabolic syndrome (OR=1.05; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.09), and hypertension (OR=1.04; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.07) adjusting for both demographic and endogenous factors related to recreational substance use. Each year increase in cigarette smoking was significantly associated with increased odds of hypertension (OR=1.03; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.06) and hyperglycemia (OR=1.03; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.05) after adjusting for confounders.

Diabetic Foot Syndrome (DFS) is the most costly and devastating complication of diabetes mellitus (DM), which early effective assessment can reduce the severity of complications including ulceration and amputations. This study aimed to review dermatological and musculoskeletal assessment of diabetic foot.
Materials and methods
In this review article, we searched for articles published between March 1, 1980 and July 28, 2015 in PubMed, Science Direct, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus, for both English and non-English language articles with the following keywords: “Diabetic foot syndrome”, “Ulceration”, “Amputation”, “Foot assessment”, “Skin disorders” and “Musculoskeletal deformities”.
Results
In dermatological dimension, most studies focused on elucidated changes in skin temperature, color, hardiness and turgor as well as common skin disorders such as Diabetic Dermopathy (DD), Necrobiosis Lipoidica Diabeticorum (NLD) and Diabetic Bullae (DB), which are common in diabetic patients and have high potential for leading to limb-threatening problems such as ulceration and infection. In musculoskeletal dimension, most studies focused on range of motion and muscle strength, gait patterns and as well as foot deformities especially Charcot osteoarthropathy (COA), which is the most destructive musculoskeletal complication of diabetes.
Conclusion
DFS as a common condition in DM patients lead to ulceration and lower limb amputation frequently unless a prompt and comprehensive assessment was taken. So that dermatological and musculoskeletal assessments are usually neglected in primary health care, these assessments should be done frequently to reduce the high risk of serious complications."

Obesity and diabetes are contributed to cardiovascular disease risk. The current study was performed to evaluate the association of central and general obesity and cardio-metabolic risk factors, including dyslipidemia and hypertension in T2DM patients.
Methods
This was a cross-sectional study in T2DM adults. Body mass index (BMI) was used to identify general obesity and waist circumference (WC) was measured to define abdominal obesity (based on ATP III). Biochemical analyses, and anthropometric and blood pressure measurements were done for all participants.
Results
Participants with central obesity showed significantly higher systolic (132.5mmHg vs. 125.4mmHg, p=0.024) and diastolic blood pressures (84.9mmHg vs. 80mmHg, p=0.007) than participants without obesity. Dyslipidemia was more prevalent in all participants either by BMI (98.3% vs. 97%, 95% CI: 0.18–17.53) or by WC (97.2% vs. 98%, 95% CI: 0.07–7.19).

It is estimated that around 20–25 percent of the world's adult population has metabolic syndrome. In this manuscript, we have reviewed the existing data linking gut microbiome with metabolic syndrome. Existing evidence from studies both in animals and humans support a link between gut microbiome and various components of metabolic syndrome. Possible pathways include involvement with energy homeostasis and metabolic processes, modulation of inflammatory signaling pathways, interferences with the immune system, and interference with the renin-angiotensin system. Modification of gut microbiota via prebiotics, probiotics or other dietary interventions has provided evidence to support a possible beneficial effect of interventions targeting gut microbiota modulation to treat components or complications of metabolic syndrome."

Type 2 diabetes has grown to epidemic proportions in the U.S. and physical activity levels in the population continues to remain low, although it is one of the primary preventive strategies for diabetes. The objectives of this study were to estimate the direct medical costs of type 2 diabetes attributable to not meeting physical activity Guidelines and to physical inactivity in the U.S. in 2012.
Methods
This was a cross sectional study that used physical activity prevalence data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to estimate the population attributable risk percentage for type 2 diabetes. These data were combined with the prevalence and cost data of type 2 diabetes to estimate the cost of type 2 diabetes attributable to not meeting physical activity Guidelines and to inactivity in 2012.
Results
The cost of type 2 diabetes in the U.S. in 2012, attributable to not meeting physical activity guidelines was estimated to be $18.3 billion, and that attributable to physical inactivity was estimated to be $4.65 billion. Based on sensitivity analyses, these estimates ranged from $10.19 billion to $27.43 billion for not meeting physical activity guidelines and $2.59 billion–$6.98 billion for physical inactivity in the year 2012.
Conclusions
This study shows that billions of dollars could be saved annually just in terms of type 2 diabetes cost in the U.S., if the entire adult population met physical activity guidelines. Physical activity promotion, particularly at the environmental and policy level should be a priority in the population."

The purpose of this study was to investigate relation between daily water and beverage intake of adults working in day or shift work and lipid profile.
Materials and methods
Total beverages intake was estimated in shift and administrative staff of Ahvaz International Airport, Iran. Forty five male, aged 25–55 years, attending this institute were invited to participate in this study. They completed a three-day food records and all participants were measured plasma lipid profiles.
Results and conclusion
Forty one of participants completed all aspects of the study. Two clusters were emerged, labeled descriptively as Conventional including “high Sugar-sweetened drinkers” and “low sugar drinkers”. The highest intake of water was in cluster 1 (1170.9ml/day) even this amount is much less than the daily recommended amounts. There were significant differences in triglyceride levels among day and night shift workers. According to the results, there is inadequacy of water and high sugar beverage intake among the shift workers which it is a potential risk of some related chronic diseases such as metabolic syndrome with high triglyceride level in the future."

Several studies have shown that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) may improve insulin resistance in various diseases. However, the possible effect of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation on insulin resistance in PCOS still remains unclear. We evaluated the effect of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on insulin resistance in women with PCOS in a meta-analysis.
Methods
Literature searches of MEDLINE, PubMed Central and EMBASE for publications in English were conducted up to December 2015. We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated effects of omega-3 fatty acids supplements on insulin resistance in women with PCOS. Results are summarized as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Effect sizes of eligible studies were pooled using random-effects models (the DerSimonian-Laird estimator). We assessed the potential sources of heterogeneity using the standard χ2 test.
Results
Of 1202 papers, three RCTs were eligible for inclusion which involved 72 cases and 73 controls. The dose range for omega3 supplement was 1.2g to 3.6g and the duration of follow-up was from 6 to 8 weeks. There was no significant effect of omega-3 fatty acids supplements compared to placebo on insulin resistance (MD: 6.18; CI; −3.347, 15.382; p=0.208) and HOMA −IR (MD: 0.276; 95% CI=−1.428, 1.981; p=0.751) in women with PCOS.
Conclusion
The results provide an evidence that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids may not have a beneficial effect on improving insulin resistance in women with PCOS."

Metabolic syndrome as a cardiovascular disease predictor, is proposed to be reduced by following a Mediterranean diet. This study was aimed to explore the relationships between metabolic syndrome and Mediterranean diet in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.
Materials
A cross-sectional study was performed on 158 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients 28–75 years old (mean age: 54.3±9.6 yrs). Fasting glucose and lipid profile were measured. Blood pressure and anthropometric characteristics of each participant were recorded. Food frequency questionnaires were evaluated using an 11-item score to determine the adherence to Mediterranean diet.
Results
Totally, 55.4% of participants had a good adherence to Mediterranean diet. The risk of metabolic syndrome in women was significantly higher than in men (OR=8.65, CI 95%=2.88–25.99; p<0.001). Nuts, legumes and seeds consumption were associated with a significant lower risk of metabolic syndrome (OR=0.42, CI 95%=0.188–0.917; p<0.05). No considerable association was observed between metabolic syndrome and adherence to Mediterranean diet (p=0.167).

Methods
Age and gender matched 40 subjects with metabolic syndrome and 40 control groups took part in this study.
Results
The mean malondialdehyde level was significantly higher in overweight and obese subjects with metabolic syndrome than control groups (P<0.05). The mean level of IL-6 in men and the mean level of malondialdehyde in women with metabolic syndrome was significantly higher than control groups (p<0.05). There were significant positive correlation between malondialdehyde and fasting blood glucose, triglyceride and systolic blood pressure (p<0.05).
Conclusions
Our results suggest that higher levels of IL-6 and malondialdehyde may cause insulin resistance and metabolic disorders in all subjects with metabolic syndrome. Malondialdehyde level shows strong association with some metabolic syndrome components. This means the greater risk of metabolic syndrome."

To determine whether gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability of metformin monotherapy varies according to baseline BMI or at doses >1500mg/day in patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.
Methods
We performed a sub-analysis of the safety population from a prospective, multicenter, Phase IV open-label study in which 371 Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes received extended-release metformin monotherapy for 16 weeks. The incidence, severity and duration of GI adverse events (AEs) were compared between normal-weight (BMI<25kg/m2, n=155) and overweight/obese (BMI≥25kg/m2, n=216) patients. The primary objective was to determine whether baseline BMI affect the incidence, severity and duration of GI AEs, using Fisher's exact test and Student's t-test. Secondary objectives were to compare these factors according to final metformin dose (≤1500mg/day versus 2000mg/day).
Results
The proportion of patients who reported ≥1 GI AE did not differ significantly between BMI groups (25.2% of the normal-weight group versus 21.3% of the overweight/obese group; p=0.3840). Patients who reported GI AEs in the two BMI groups experienced similar GI AE severity (p=0.5410), mean duration (p=0.3572) and duration distribution (p=0.1347). There was no significant difference in GI AE severity and duration between metformin dosage groups (≤1500mg/day versus 2000mg/day).
Conclusions
Newly-diagnosed Chinese type 2 diabetes patients of normal weight are no more likely than overweight/obese patients to suffer from increased incidence rates, severity or duration of GI AEs when treated with first-line extended-release metformin monotherapy. Doses of 2000mg/day did not increase the severity or duration of GI AEs."

Methods
Cross-sectional multicenter study which included patients with stages 3 to 4 CKD. SHPTH was considered when the intact PTH levels (iPTH) were equal or higher than 70pg/ml. We divided the sample into two groups (diabetics and non-diabetics). We used robust statistical methods.
Results
409 patients (214 diabetics) were studied. HPTH was found in 60.4% of diabetics vs 65% of non-diabetics (P=0.42). Diabetics with HPTH were younger (79.5 vs 82.3 years-old, P=0.005), and had more hypertension (P=0.0014), dyslipidemia (P=0.0001) and comorbidities. In multivariate analysis, we found a significant relationship in case of diabetics, with age (OR: 1.04, 95%CI 1.005–1.09 P=0.02 ), and with statins treatment (OR 2.3, 95%CI 1.17–4.54, P=0.01).
Discussion
The prevalence of SHPTH between the groups was similar, however, diabetics had more presence of hypertension and dyslipidemia, and SHPTH in this case was also related with moderate microalbuminuria and lower levels of vitamin D. An association with statins was also found in this group."

Material and methods
In this study a questionnaire to assess general population awareness about type II diabetes disease and its complications was Design, developing and validation based on 10 experts’ panel and statistical inferences.
Results
Initially 67 questions designed and according to the experts’ panel 16 questions were removed and 11 questions were edited. Finally, content validity of 51 questions has been approved by the experts’ panel. According to Lawshe’s score if CVRs were at least 0.8, items will be has content validity. The results show that both internal consistency and intra-class-correlation were good (>0.75). Cronbach’s alpha and ICC were 0.84 and 0.82, respectively for all questions. To confirm structure of conceptual model, confirmatory factor analysis and Amos software was used. Goodness of Fit Index was RMSEA=0.027, GFI=0.95, AGFI=0.91, CFI=0.97; and showed that the hypothesized model is approved.
Conclusion
In general, we can say that the questionnaire is approximately comprehensive and complete. It is suggested that to assess awareness of diabetes type 2 in seven dominants (e.g. fundamentals, common symptoms, early and late complications, diet, control methods, and source of information of DMT2) this questionnaire should be used in general population."

The study population consisted of 200 subjects, 100 with metabolic syndrome (case) and 100 without metabolic syndrome (control) aged between 18 and 80 years, attending OPD at PBM Hospital were studied. Controls were age and sex matched to the cases. Blood tests and all physical variables were examined using standard methods. Subjects were divided into 6 groups according to their possession of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 components of the metabolic syndrome. Statistical analysis was done using ANOVA, linear regression analysis and multivariate linear regression model.
Results
Mean serum UA level was significantly associated with all components of metabolic syndrome (p<0.001) and had strong positive correlation (r=+0.66 to +0.77, p<0.0001) with all of them except serum HDL with which it showed strong negative correlation(r=−0.71, p<0.0001). It increased as the number of metabolic factors increased showing a highly significant trend (p<0.0001). On multivariate regression analysis UA contributed to 66.84% variance of metabolic syndrome.
Conclusion
The current multivariate regression analysis clearly infers that uric acid can be considered as a marker and potential modifier of metabolic syndrome."

This study examined the prevalence of sleep disorders (SD) and self-reported sleep symptoms and risk factors among adult patients diagnosed with T2DM.
Methods
Data were obtained from the 2012 US National Health and Wellness Survey, an annual Internet-based survey. A total of 7239 participants reported a diagnosis of T2DM. Patients also provided information on diagnosis of SD (e.g., insomnia, sleep breathing disorder, other sleep conditions, etc.) and regularly experienced sleep symptoms (e.g., difficulty falling asleep, sleep apnea, daytime sleepiness, difficulty staying awake, etc.). Logistic regressions were used to examine factors associated with SD and symptoms.
Results
The average age was 59.9 (standard deviation=12.2), 59.5% were male, 24.4% were diagnosed with SD, 76.8% reported experiencing any sleep symptom regularly (difficulty falling asleep, 30.5%; sleep apnea, 17.4%; daytime sleepiness, 26.8%; difficulty staying awake, 10.1%). Logistic regression models showed the strongest predictors of diagnosed SD were obesity class (OC) III (OR=2.20), White (OR=1.92), OC II (OR=1.57), smoking (OR=1.57), lower income (OR=1.49–1.19), unemployment (OR=1.38), and comorbidities (OR=1.35), all p<0.05. The strongest predictors of any sleep symptom were OC III (OR=2.22), OC II (OR=1.78), lower income (OR=1.74–1.24), female gender (OR=1.72), OC I (OR=1.60), White (OR=1.54), and smoking (OR=1.47), all p<0.05.
Conclusions
Almost 25% of patients with T2DM were diagnosed with SD and over 75% reported experiencing at least one sleep symptom regularly. SD and symptoms were strongly associated with obesity, White ethnicity, gender, low income, and smoking. Interventions focusing on weight management and smoking cessation have shown to improve T2DM and may improve SD."

The current study intended to explore the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) related with prediabetes by assessing oxidative stress and inflammation using serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and urine microalbumin (MA) and their correlation with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and physical measurements.
Materials and methods
Based on FPG values, 80 subjects were grouped into prediabetes and healthy controls. IL-6 and MPO were estimated in serum sample whereas MA was estimated in random urine sample.
Results
Prediabetes group had significantly increased (p<0.05) mean anthropometric measurements and IL-6, MPO and MA as compared to healthy controls. MPO had significant correlation with FPG (r-0.388) in the prediabetes group. IL-6 and MPO showed a positive correlation with body mass index (BMI (r-0.339, r-0.327)), waist circumference (WC (r-484, r-0.493)) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR (r-0.430, r-0.493)) while MA did not correlate with FPG and anthropometric measurements.
Conclusion
This study suggests that prediabetes is associated with central adiposity, inflammation and oxidative stress predisposing them to an increased risk for CVD."

abstract = "Aim
The present study was designed to estimate the progression rates from combination of normal weight, overweight, obesity, and number of metabolic abnormalities (MA) to type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a non-diabetic high risk population in Isfahan, Iran.
Methods
A total of 1869 non-diabetic first-degree relatives (FDR) of patients with T2D 30–70 years old were examined and followed for a mean (SD) of 7.3 (2.2) years for T2D incidence. At baseline and through follow-up, participants underwent a standard 75-g 2-h oral glucose tolerance test.
Results
The metabolically healthy overweight and obese at baseline were associated with incidence of T2D, independently of age and gender. Any one MA increased the risk of developing T2D among normal weight, overweight and obese individuals. Those with normal weight and ≥3 MA were over 20 times (odds ratios (OR) 20.21; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 2.4, 170.4) and those with overweight and ≥3 MA 22.5 times (OR 22.5; 95% CI 3.0, 167.0) and obese with ≥3 MA were 25.4 times (OR 25.4; 95% CI 3.4, 187) more likely to develop T2D than those with normal weight and without MA. Compared with participants without MA, obese individuals with concomitant MA were not significantly more likely to progress to T2D.
Conclusion
Our data provide further evidence that normal weight, overweight and obese individuals with MA had a higher risk of incident T2D than normal weight individuals without MA."

In sub-Saharan Africa, there is no precise use of metabolic syndrome (MetS) definitions and risk factors screening indices in many clinical and public health services. Methods proposed and used in Western populations are adopted without validation within the local settings. The aim of the study is to assess obesity indices and cut-off values that maximise screening of MetS and risk factors in the Nigerian population.
Method
A consolidated analysis of 2809 samples from four population-based cross-sectional study of apparently healthy persons≥18 years was carried out. Optimal waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) cut points for diagnosing MetS and risk factors were determined using Optimal Data Analysis (ODA) model. The stability of the predictions of the models was also assessed.
Results
Overall mean values of BMI, WC and WHtR were 24.8±6.0kgm−2, 84.0±11.3cm and 0.52±0.1 respectively. Optimal WC cut-off for discriminating MetS and diabetes was 83cm in females and 85cm in males, and 82cm in females and 89cm in males, respectively. WC was stable in discriminating diabetes than did WHtR and BMI, while WHtR showed better stability in predicting MetS than WC and BMI.
Conclusion
The study shows that the optimal WC that maximises classification accuracy of MetS differs from that currently used for sub-Saharan ethnicity. The proposed global WHtR of 0.50 may misclassify MetS, diabetes and hypertension. Finally, the WC is a better predictor of diabetes, while WHtR is a better predictor of MetS in this sample population."

abstract = "Aim
Optimal treatment intensification strategies in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) receiving basal insulin supported oral antidiabetic therapy (BOT) remain controversial. The objective of the present study was to compare outcomes of BOT-intensification by either the uptitration of long-acting insulin glargine or by the immediate addition of a rapid acting insulin analogue (RAIA).
Methods
This was a prospective, observational, 24-week study in T2DM patients with BOT using insulin glargine and baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) between 7.0 and 8.5%. Patients were stratified by their physicians to one of the following treatment intensification strategies: Basal insulin titration to target with discretionary subsequent addition of RAIA at weeks 12 or 24 (GLAR), or immediate addition of RAIA at baseline (GLARplus).
Results
A total of 3266 patients were prescreened of whom 2202 fulfilled the selection criteria. Of these, 1684 patients were documented in the GLAR group and 518 in the GLARplus group. In the GLAR group, in 91 (5.5%) and 21 patients (1.3%) RAIA was added at weeks 12 and 24, respectively. The groups displayed similar baseline characteristics; except, mean diabetes duration was slightly shorter in the GLAR group (8.7 vs. 9.4 years). During the study, insulin glargine dose was increased from 18.7 to 26.4U (plus 7.7U) in GLAR and from 24.9 to 27.3U (plus 2.4U) in GLARplus patients. Mean RAIA dose was 9.6±4.7U at the final visit. After 24 weeks, HbA1c was reduced by 0.8 and 0.9% in the GLAR and GLARplus groups, respectively (both p<0.001). An HbA1c of ≤7.0% was achieved in 49.2% of GLAR and 48.5% of GLARplus patients. In both groups, we observed improvements in cardiovascular risk factors such as lipids and blood pressure. The rates of symptomatic (1.6 vs. 1.7%) and severe (0.18 vs. 0.19%) hypoglycemic episodes were low and comparable in both groups.
Conclusion
These findings provide evidence that treatment intensification in patients with type 2 diabetes not at glycemic target on BOT with insulin glargine is equally safe and effective using either long-acting insulin titration alone or the addition of a rapid-acting insulin analogue."

Hyperglycemia increases oxidative stress through the overproduction of reactive oxygen species, which results in an imbalance between free radicals and the antioxidant defense system of the cells. A positive correlation was reported between lipid peroxide levels and diabetic complication.
Objectives
The aim of the present study was to investigate the state of oxidative stress in controlled and uncontrolled diabetic patients.
Methods
One hundred thirty nine participants were included in this study, grouped as: Group-I: Healthy Control group of non-diabetic normal subjects, Group-II: Controlled type-2 DM group of subjects with type-2 DM and HbA1c≤8% and Group-III: Uncontrolled type-2 DM group of subjects with type-2 DM and HbA1c>8%. Fasting blood glucose, 2h postprandial glucose, MDA and HbA1c were quantified. The association between diabetic control and lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde) was evaluated.
Results
The mean HbA1c increased significantly in uncontrolled type-2 DM subjects compared to controlled type-2 DM group. Lipid peroxidation as expressed in MDA was significantly increased in uncontrolled type-2 DM group compared to controlled type-2 DM, both groups show significant elevation in this parameter compared to healthy subjects. There is a significant positive correlation between MDA and HbA1c in the studied subjects.
Conclusion
The core problem during diabetes is poor glycemic control, which leads to protein glycation, lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress and ﬁnally varieties of complications. Periodic evaluation of lipid peroxidation products in diabetes mellitus is recommended as it could contribute to the early identiﬁcation and management of oxidative stress."

Oxytocin (OXT) is a neurohypophyseal hormone that has been recently shown to possess a number of beneficial effects in diabetes and obesity. Betatrophin is a protein expressed in fat and liver that regulates lipid metabolism and promotes pancreatic β-cell proliferation. It is not investigated yet whether OXT and betatrophin levels correlate in metabolic syndrome (MS) or diabetes patients.
Methods
The aim was to assess correlations between plasma betatrophin and OXT levels in MS-diabetic or prediabetic (N=89) as compared to MS-non-diabetic (N=69) patients. Competitive binding ELISA was used to evaluate betatrophin and OXT plasma concentrations. Correlations of the above biomarkers and patient clinical characteristics were also detected.
Results
As compared to the control MS participants (0.32±0.25ng/mL); betatrophin plasma levels were increased (P<0.001) in the MS-pre/T2DM patients (1.23±0.68ng/mL). On the contrary, OXT concentrations were decreased (P<0.001) in the MS-pre/T2DM patients (1222.46±514.55pg/mL) as compared to the MS control subjects (2323.42±848.68pg/mL). OXT concentration correlated negatively (r=−0.492, P<0.001), while HbA1c and FPG correlated positively with betatrophin plasma levels (P<0.001), but were inversely correlated with OXT levels (P<0.001) in the total sample.
Conclusion
Betatrophin levels are increased, while OXT levels are decreased in MS-pre/T2DM. We found an inverse correlation between the levels of the two biomarkers in addition to correlation between their levels and the degree of glycemic control."

Recent years have seen an increasing body of work on the following metabolic defects common to both obesity and diabetes such as, impaired tissue perfusion, sleep disturbances, androgen dysfunction, altered Vitamin D levels and GI stress. The scope of this review is to present the most widely accepted theories that link the two diseases, provide an update on some proposed unifying metabolic defects and highlight current and future prevention and management strategies."

To determine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and prediabetes in a population of the city of Guayaquil, Ecuador, aged 55–65 years; to observe if there are differences in prevalence between males and females, and to describe the frequency with which each component of the metabolic syndrome is found in this population.
Materials and methods
population-based cross-sectional study in Guayaquil. We recruited people of both genders, with ages ranging from 55 to 65 years. Through clinical history, physical examination and laboratory tests, we obtained necessary data to diagnose metabolic syndrome and/or prediabetes. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS® 22.
Results
we obtained a sample of 213 patients, 64.5% were females and 35.5% were males. Mean age was 60.3 years (±3.1). A total 65.8% of patients had increased waist circumference, and 45% were diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. Hypertriglyceridemia was the most prevalent condition in males, while women more commonly had low HDL. Prediabetes was diagnosed in 45.9% of our patients, and 19.5% had both disorders. There was no significant difference on metabolic syndrome prevalence between genders, but prediabetes was significantly more common in women.
Conclusion
we found a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome and prediabetes in Guayaquil, higher than what was reported in other areas. Abdominal obesity is even more prevalent. Women have prediabetes more frequently than men. Our patients, given their age, are at higher risk of cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline by having metabolic syndrome and/or prediabetes."

abstract = "Aims
Serum uric acid level has been suggested to be associated with metabolic syndrome risk factors. However, the association between metabolic syndrome and serum uric acid is still controversial and challenging. This study was aimed to investigate the association between serum uric acid levels and metabolic syndrome components in personnel of the Shahroud University of Medical Sciences.
Material and methods
This case–control study was conducted on 499 personnel aged 30–60 years old who were working in Shahroud University of Medical Sciences, in 2015. MetS was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) criteria. The relationship between serum UA level and the number of metabolic components was determined by linear regression analysis.
Result
In this study, the mean concentration of serum uric acid in men with the syndrome was higher than that in women. Mean serum UA level increased as the number of metabolic factors increased. The mean serum uric acid levels was 4.98±1.64 in patients with metabolic syndrome and 4.5±1.28 in non-patients (p=0.005). Subject with abnormal uric acid were almost 2.62 times more likely than other subject to develop the syndrome.
Conclusions
The results of this study showed that only hypertriglyceridemia is a component which increases the risk of hyperuricemia. In addition, hyperuricemia increases the risk of metabolic syndrome by more than two fold. It seems that high uric acid can be considered as a predisposing factor for metabolic syndrome; thus, it is recommended to measure serum uric acid in routine tests."

To determine if insulin resistance (IR), an important predictor of cardiovascular risk in the general population and in type 2 diabetes mellitus, can be assessed using simple parameters which are readily available in clinical practice.
Methods
This cross-sectional study included 194 patients with type 2 diabetes. Body mass index, waist index (WI), triglyceride levels, 1/HDL, triglyceride/HDL, uric acid and urine albumin:creatinine ratio were investigated as possible predictors of IR.
Results
WI correlated more strongly than any other parameter with log insulin levels, log fasting glucose to insulin ratio (FGIR), log fasting glucose to insulin product (FGIP), homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) and quantitative insulin check index (QUICKI). WI also emerged as the strongest independent predictor of IR indices studied in regression as well as in ROC analyses. At a cut-off of 1.115, WI had a 78% sensitivity and 65% specificity for predicting IR when HOMA-IR was used as indicator of IR, and 74% sensitivity and specificity when QUICKI was used as indicator of IR. Combining WI with other variables did not improve performance significantly.
Conclusions
In our cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes, WI was the parameter with the strongest association with, and the best predictor of, IR."

Increased incidence of CVD has been observed in recent years in the Kashmir valley (North India). Since the risk factor development of the cardiovascular diseases (CVD) takes place during childhood, we undertook an epidemiological survey to assess the prevalence of dyslipidemia in the school children of Kashmir valley.
Materials and methods
1131 children of 5–19 years of age were selected and evaluated for BMI, cholesterol, TGs, LDL and HDL levels from different areas of Srinagar city (urban) region of the Kashmir valley from June 2011–June 2014.
Results
The frequency of dyslipidemia in Kashmiri children varied along the subjects. Hypertriglyceridemia was seen in 82.6% of the males and 47.6% of females in the age group of 5–9 years, 38.5% of males and 51.1% of females in the age group of 10–14 years and 24.7% of males and 35.9% of the females in the age group of 15–19 years. Low levels of HDL than normal were seen in 34.7% of males and 19% of females in the age group of 5–9 years. Similarly low HDL levels were seen in 17.9% of males and 15.5% of females in the age group of 10–14 years. The incidence of low HDL was also seen in 4.9% of males and 10.8% of females in the age group of 15–19 years.
Conclusions
In the present study dyslipidemia was more common in centrally obese children and the most common component was high triglycerides and low HDL's. Female school children were at higher risk of developing CVD than males."

To investigate the patterns and relationship among the metabolic syndrome (MS), coronary heart disease (CHD) and kidney function.
Methods
A cross-sectional secondary data set of 9359 individuals, age 30–74 years, receiving annual health check-up in 2012 were used in this studied. Identification of MS and CHD development was determined by International Diabetes Federation criteria and Framingham risk score, respectively, while kidney function was assessed by using the estimate glomerulus filtration rate (eGFR) and chronic kidney disease epidemiology (CKD-EPI) formula.
Results
The prevalence of MS was 16.1%. The majority pattern of MS in male displayed abnormalities of body mass index (BMI) plus triglyceride and blood pressure (BP). Most of them had high risk of CHD, and kidney function in stage 1 and 2. Furthermore, abnormalities of BMI plus BP and blood glucose were the main components related to high risk of CHD, and stage 1 of kidney function in female.
Conclusion
This finding showed the cleared pattern of the sequential abnormality factors which potentially use for setting the activity and empowerment team to prevention, promotion, and treatment strategy in MS patients. Particularly, BMI is the first assessment and then follow by blood pressure and blood sugar which could be used as the guideline for reducing MS associated with CHD and kidney disorder in Thai population."

The present study aims to study the prevalence of depression in patients with uncomplicated type II diabetes mellitus and to find its association with various socio-demographic factors in the same.
Materials and methods
A cross-sectional, single interview study was performed in an outpatient department of an endocrinology institute. Total 80 type II DM patients without any associated complications of diabetes were included in this study. To diagnose Depressive Episode, structured clinical interview for DSM V was applied. Severity of depression was assessed by Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). To assess socio-demographic characteristics of the patients, all of them were evaluated with a semi-structured socio-demographic performa.
Results
38.75% patients (N=31) were found to be suffering from depression. Among them 48.38% were moderately depressed and none were suffering from very severe depression. Significant association was not found between depression and socio-demographic factors of age (p=0.920), gender (p=0.251), economic profile (p=0.583), local background of the patient (p=0.646), educational qualification (p=0.935) and marital status (p=0.644). Similarly no association was found with duration of diabetes, HbA1c and BMI.
Conclusion
Exclusion of complicated cases didn’t seem to influence overall prevalence of depression, although reduction in severity was apparent. Thus even in those diabetic patients who are leading a complication free life, a detailed psychiatric analysis to rule out depression is mandatory."

The drug therapy details of the patients were collected from inpatient case records in the respective clinical wards. Clinical pharmacist reviewed the drug therapy, identified the drug related problems during ward rounds and discussed with the physicians and suitable suggestions was provided which had been documented.
Results
A total of 189 drug therapy problems were identified from 151 patient case records. The number of drug related problems was found to more in males than females. Drug related problems were commonly seen in patients aged between 61 and 70 years of age. The most common drug related problems was found to be drug use without indication (17.98%) followed by improper drug selection (16.40%). The most frequent suggestions by the clinical pharmacist were on cessation of drug (30.68%). The acceptance rate of suggestions and the changes in drug therapy was found to be high (58.20%). The majority of the level of significance of drug related problems was seen to have moderate significance in grade.

To assess the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its correlation with the severity and duration of psoriasis.
Methods
One hundred psoriasis patients and 100 age-and-sex matched controls were included, whose waist circumference and blood pressure were measured; fasting serum cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose levels quantified; disease severity assessed and metabolic syndrome defined separately by two globally accepted criteria.
Results
Metabolic syndrome (38%:12%), hypertriglyceridemia (53%:25%), impaired glucose tolerance (38%:16%) [P<0.001] and low HDL (P=0.002) were significantly more prevalent in cases as compared to controls as were the mean values of triglycerides and fasting blood sugar. Increased mean age of psoriasis patients and duration of disease strongly correlated with the presence of this syndrome. The divergence in definition of the syndrome by two separate criteria was also highly significant (P<0.001).

In addition, it negatively affects a patient’s quality of life and social environment, and poses a burden on national health care budgets. Although various therapeutic approaches, such as hypoglycemic agents, antihypertensive drugs, and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, have been tried to slow the progression of nephropathy, the number of patients with diabetic kidney disease continues to rise with the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Thus, early identification of patients at risk of developing diabetic nephropathy and initiation of appropriate therapy is important to improve patient outcomes.

Different approaches for screening and diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus(GDM) have great impact on all process of management of gestational diabetes and its future complications. The aims of this study were to evaluate rate, risk factors and outcomes of GDM based on International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups diagnostic criteria.
Materials
In a prospective study pregnant women attended 5 clinics in Ahvaz, screened for gestational diabetes mellitus using IADPSG criteria and followed up delivery from August 2014 to February 2015. At the first prenatal visit women underwent the fasting blood sugar test. A 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed for 750 mothers between 24 and 32 weeks of gestation. Logistic regression test for calculating the odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals was used.
Results
The mean age of participants was 28.43±5.52years. The overall rate of GDM in our study was 29.9% (224/750). Incidence of gestational diabetes was associated with age group≥35years [OR=1.92(95% CI, 1.19–3.09)], family history of diabetes [OR=2.47(95% CI, 1.33–4.59)], previous GDM [OR=3.12(1.35–7.19)], BMI≥25 [OR=1, 71(1.10–2.67)] Using logistic regression. The most common maternal complication in studied women was cesarean section followed by hypertension and preeclampsia.
Conclusion
About one third of studied women diagnosed as GDM according to the IADPSG criteria. Risk factors of GDM were maternal age, family history of diabetes, Previous GDM, overweight and obesity before pregnancy, the same reported factors with 2 steps approach. Higher rate of GDM using this criterion may increase concern about healthcare costs and workloads."

Dietary factors can affect the coronary heart disease (CHD). Results of previous studies on the association between the diet and CHD are not consistent in different countries. There were no data on this association in Armenia.
Objective
Aims of this case-control study were to evaluate the association between nutritional factors and CHD among Armenians in Yerevan.
Methods
During 2010 and 2011, we randomly selected 320 CHD patients with a diagnosis of CHD less than 6 months and 320 subjects without CHD (≥30years old) from the hospitals and polyclinics in Yerevan. Dietary intakes with 135 food items over the previous 12 months were evaluated using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire.
Results
After adjusting for some CHD risk factors higher intakes of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) were associated with a reduced risk of CHD, while this association was not witnessed for saturated fatty acids (SFA). In addition, findings indicated an inverse relation between vitamins (E, B6 and B12, folic acid) and fiber with CHD. In this population, smoking, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome (MetS) were significantly more common among patients with CHD.
Conclusion
The intake of vitamins E, B6 and B12, folic acid, PUFA, MUFA and fiber appeared to be predictors of CHD, independently of other risk factors."

Metabolic syndrome (MS) and atherosclerosis are chronic inflammatory conditions. Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (LpPLA2) is a circulatory marker of systemic inflammation and a risk predictor for cardiovascular diseases. This study aims to evaluate the expression of this enzyme in an effort to understand the underlying mechanism of atherosclerosis in MS.
Methods
This study included twenty patients of MS and same number of healthy controls. Anthropometry and clinical examination were carried out in both groups. Real time PCR was performed for LpPLA2 mRNA and relative expression was calculated using ΔΔCT method keeping β2 microglobin and β-actin as internal controls.
Results
LpPLA2 mRNA expression was higher in patients of MS. Fold change was 5.7 when β2 microglobin was used as normaliser and 4.97 when β-actin was used. mRNA levels of LpPLA2 correlated significantly with waist circumference (r=0.462, p=0.003) and systolic blood pressure (r=0.392, p=0.015) as well as high density lipoprotein cholesterol (r=−0.453, p=0.003).
Conclusions
High expression of LpPLA2 mRNA indicates that systemic inflammation has role in pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in patients of MS. This is evident from its direct correlation with blood pressure. The study also suggests that expression of LpPLA2 may be associated with obesity. Therefore, LpPLA2 mRNA expression levels may develop as an important risk predictor for vascular complications in MS."

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is considered to be one of the important risk factors for cardiac diseases. Frank diabetes is usually preceded by long term abnormality in glucose homeostasis which is called pre-diabetes. The hypothesis that diabetic patients have greater risk and worse prognosis of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) than pre-diabetics is controversial. Considering that India has been declared as a diabetic capital of the world, the study aimed to assess the load of pre diabetics, diabetics and non-diabetics landing in myocardial infarction.
Materials and methods
The study consisted of through physiological and biochemical evaluation of 200 patients of newly diagnosed AMI and evaluating the load of non-diabetics, pre-diabetics and diabetics among them.
Result
It was found that the total non-diabetic population (normoglycaemic and pre-diabetic) formed the bulk of AMI patient (69%) in our study. The degree of biochemical alterations seen among the three groups suggests that abnormal glucose homeostasis is not the sole determinant of the severity of AMI. The study data also suggests that glycaemic status, which poses a risk for AMI, differs in male and female individuals. Males even with normal glucose level are at increased risk to develop MI.
Conclusion
The study concludes that both males and females with their blood glucose in pre-diabetic range are seen to be vulnerable to develop AMI. Thus all individuals irrespective of their glycaemic status around the age of forty should be screened and individuals with fasting sugar in pre-diabetic range should take extra precaution in terms of healthy diet, life style and regular check up"

abstract = "Objective
The relationships between the waist circumference (WC), visceral adipose tissue (VAT) thickness and three components of metabolic syndrome (MetS) were explored to verify which of the obesity indices might be superior.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted of 1256 subjects (840 males and 416 females) aged 26–89 years, who were individuals undergoing intensive health checkup. The three components of MetS examined were high blood pressure, glucose intolerance and dyslipidemia. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis were used for the analyses.
Results
The mean values of the WC and VAT thickness were significantly higher in the subject group positive for each of the metabolic syndrome components than in the subject group that was negative for all the components (p<0.001). ROC curve analysis showed that the WC showed an advantage over the VAT thickness only for predicting high blood pressure in men. Logistic regression analysis revealed increase of the odds ratios of the WC for glucose intolerance (p<0.001), high blood pressure (p<0.001) and dyslipidemia (p<0.01) in men. In contrast, the odds ratio of the VAT thickness was significantly increased only for dyslipidemia (p<0.01) in men. In women, the odds ratios of the WC for glucose intolerance (p<0.01) and dyslipidemia (p<0.001) were significantly increased, and odds ratio of the VAT thickness for high blood pressure (p<0.01) was significantly increased.
Conclusion
This survey presented an advantage of WC over VAT thickness as an obesity index for identifying all the three components of metabolic syndrome, although sex differences in the study outcomes were found."

The study was aimed to investigate the effect of voglibose or acarbose as an add-on treatment in overweight/obese type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients who are uncontrolled with metformin and sulfonylureas (SUs) in Western part of India.
Participants and methods
A retrospective study included 77 participants (BMI≥25kg/m2; HbA1c level>8% and<9.5%) with overweight/obese T2DM. These participants were treated with either voglibose or acarbose. Glycemic parameters (fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c]), bodyweight, BMI and lipid parameters were evaluated at baseline, 3-month, 6-month and 9-month of treatment. Adverse events were also captured at respective time points.
Results
Voglibose showed significant reduction in HbA1c and bodyweight with short duration of treatment (6 months; P<0.05 and 9 months; P<0.01) whereas acarbose showed significant reduction with longer duration of treatment (9 months; P<0.05) when compared with baseline. Moreover, both treatment groups were reported with reduction in BMI. Further, significant improvement in lipid parameters except LDL and HDL were observed in both treatment groups when compared with baseline. None of participant was discontinued due to side effects of the treatment. In addition, the frequency of hypoglycemia was decreased in both treatment groups.
Conclusion
Voglibose or acarbose as an add-on treatment with metformin and sulfonylureas in uncontrolled obese/overweight T2DM provides desired glycemic control, reduces bodyweight and improves lipid parameters with good tolerability profile."

abstract = "Aims
Physical activity is an essential determinant of health. However, there is dearth of evidence regarding prevalence of physical activity in developing countries, especially its association with metabolic syndrome risk factors. This study assessed the association of physical activity with metabolic syndrome in a Nigerian population.
Materials and methods
A cross-sectional study was carried out on apparently healthy persons who are ≥18 years old. The World Health Organisation (WHO) Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) was used to collect five domains of physical activity. Participants were classified as physically active or inactive based on meeting the cut-off value of 600 MET-min/week. Metabolic syndrome was diagnosed using the Joint Scientific Statement on Harmonizing the Metabolic Syndrome criteria.
Results
Overall prevalence of physically active individuals was 50.1% (CI: 45.6–54.7%). Physical inactivity is significantly more in females (p<0.01) and among participants >40 years old (p<0.0001). Whereas individuals with metabolic syndrome appeared more likely to be physically active (OR=1.48, CI: 0.71–3.09); physical inactivity showed to exist more among participants who were living in urban area (OR=6.61, CI: 3.40–12.85, p<0.001). Participants with prediabetes (OR=1.69, CI: 0.62–4.61) and diabetes (OR=1.91, CI: 0.65–5.63) were more likely to be physically inactive as compared to other metabolic syndrome risk factors.
Conclusion
The high prevalence of physical inactivity in this study population is a clear indication that concerted efforts to improve physical activity may be required. However, it seems that metabolic syndrome is not improved by being physically active. This suggests that interventions directed at physical activity alone may not produce optimal efficacy in this study population."

It is important to identify the risk factors for metabolic syndrome (MetS) in order to prevent the development of cardio-/cerebrovascular diseases. The authors estimated the risk factors for the development of MetS with special emphasis on the severity of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB).
Methods
We conducted as a cross-sectional study in subjects undergoing intensive health examination (581 men aged 33–84 years). Diagnosis of MetS was based on the criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel.
Results
The prevalence of MetS in subjects with severe SDB, which was defined as an apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) of 30 or higher, was 40.7%, which was significantly higher than that in the subjects without severe SDB (29.3%). The odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) of the logarithmic-transformed AHI for MetS was 1.6 (1.1–2.4) after adjustments for age, serum uric acid, logarithmic-transformed serum C-reactive protein, smoking history, exercise history and alcohol history. When the subjects were categorized by the severity of SDB, the OR (95% CI) of severe SDB, which was the only category that showed significant association, was 2.2 (1.2–4.0).

Diabetes mellitus has considerable public health implications for communities, individuals, and health services. Increasing prevalence of diabetes all over the world intensifies the demand for health care services, and particularly for inpatient care.
Aim
The present study aims to assess the current prevalence of diabetes and its etiology among hospitalized Jordanian adults.
Methods
This was a cross sectional study conducted at Specialist Hospital (SH) in the Jordanian capital of Amman, with data collection taking place between June and August 2015, and data was extracted manually from medical records. Patients were divided into three groups: (a) those with a medical history of diabetes, (b) those with unrecognized diabetes or new hyperglycemia, and (c) those with no diabetes. Data management and analysis were conducted using the SPSS program. Means ±SD were used to present all continuous variables, as well as the numbers and percentages for categorical variables, and we used analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare between means. For differences between categorical variables, we used (x2). A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
A total of 392 patients (266 female, 126 male) were admitted during the 10-week study period. Of these, 204 fell into category (a), 45 into category (b), and 143 into category (c). Diabetes was the principal diagnosis in 52% of the hospitalizations. Patients who had diabetes or new hyperglycemia were considerably older than non-diabetic patients. The five most common reasons for hospitalization were congestive heart failure (25.0%), pneumonia (22.5%), DKA (22.0%), coronary atherosclerosis (16.20%), and septicemia (14.20%).
Conclusion
The common etiologies for hospitalization were congestive heart failure, pneumonia, DKA, coronary atherosclerosis, and septicemia. Keeping in view the results of this study it is recommend that regular screening should be performed for diabetic patients, as this will increase the chances that many diabetes complications will be prevented, particularly for elderly subjects."

abstract = "Aims
Chronic inflammation in obesity is associated with co-morbidities such as, hyperglycemia, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Leukocytes play an important role in this inflammation and C-reactive protein (CRP) and Interleukin-2 (IL-2) can be important effectors during the immune response in obesity; however, the initial inflammatory events in obesity remain unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the circulating levels of CRP, IL-2, insulin and adiponectin, their association and the association with leukocyte count in obese individuals without co-morbidities and with or without insulin resistance (IR).
Materials and methods
Nineteen obese non-diabetic and 9 lean subjects were studied for serum levels of CRP, IL-2, insulin, adiponectin, lipids, glycated hemoglobin, glycemia, for homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), arterial pressure and anthropometric parameters, and for leukocyte counts. Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (N/L) was calculated using the loge of leukocyte counts. Associations were determined by Pearson's correlation.
Results
None of the studied groups presented co-morbidities and two groups of obese individuals with normal or high levels of insulin (IR) were found. Increased CRP concentration and decreased IL-2 and adiponectin concentrations in obese were observed. Positive correlation between leukocyte type counts with CRP in obese with IR was found; however, no correlations with IL-2 in obese were observed. Insulin in obese were positively correlated with CRP and negatively correlated with IL-2 in IR obese individuals. Adiponectin in obese was negatively correlated with CRP.
Conclusion
CRP and IL-2 may represent two important effectors in the early inflammatory events in obese individuals without co-morbidities. Adiponectin and insulin may be involved in anti-inflammatory events."

The simple screening test of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) has not been established yet. We aimed to clarify the usefulness of simple measurement of AGEs for screening tests.
Methods
The subjects were healthy participants and patients with metabolic syndrome. Urine samples were diluted from 1:10 to 1:200 using phosphate-buffered saline, and the fluorescence intensity was measured at 440nm after excitation at 370nm in a 96-well microplate spectrophotometer. The obtained intensities were adjusted according to the urinary creatinine levels.
Results
In patients with metabolic syndrome, urinary AGE levels were significantly higher than in healthy individuals (median [range], 168.25 [82.51–1276.15] AU/g creatinine [n=37] versus 134.67 [37.86–776.31] AU/g creatinine [n=350], respectively; p=0.0066). We found significant positive correlations between urinary AGEs and systolic and diastolic blood pressures (Spearman's correlation r=0.119 [p=0.019] and r=0.128 [p=0.012], respectively). There was no significant correlation between estimated glomerular filtration rate and urinary AGEs (r=0.018 [p=0.744]), confirming that renal dysfunction did not influence results of urinary AGE measurements. When all of the participants in the study were classified into four groups according to the numbers of components of metabolic syndrome, we found a significant tendency (p=0.0127) for urinary AGE levels to be higher with the increasing number of metabolic syndrome components.
Conclusion
These results suggested that measurement of urinary AGE levels may be useful for evaluating the risk of metabolic syndrome."

Background
Type 2-diabetes (T2D), is a public health problem which has reached epidemic proportions due to the rapidly increasing rates of this disease worldwide. It is known that adipose tissue can synthesize and release pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1, adiponectin and leptin that are associated with body fat mass. Hence comparing the biomarkers with individuals without hyperglycemia would help us to understand the level of increase in their values though the vascular complications have not begun.
Materials and methods
This was a cross sectional study comprising 229 diabetic persons and 205 healthy individuals. High sensitivity reactive protein (hs-CRP) was estimated using nephelometry technique. Inflammatory markers and adiponectin were measured using ELISA instrument.
Results
Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) (40.56%) and Leptin (45.43%) were significantly increased in the diabetic group when compared with normal study population. Adiponectin was significantly decreased in diabetic study population (11.94%). This was supported by a significant correlation between the glycemic index HbA1c and TNF-α (r=0.376, p=0.01), adiponectin (r=−0.381, p=0.01) and leptin (r=0.269, p=0.01) in diabetic population, but the significance was lost among the normal healthy individuals.
Conclusions
The most promising biomarkers of diabetes such as TNF-α, adiponectin, leptin has shown a marked difference in this diabetic population. This study proves the assessment of these biomarkers as future predictors of type 2 diabetes."

To examine the effects of weight gain (in kg) on the parameters of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in non-obese Japanese adults over a period of 1 year.
Method
We analyzed data on 1653 workers in a financial corporation (698 males and 955 females) who may have gained weight during 1 year but nevertheless remained non-obese. Data were collected twice: baseline data were collected between April 2010 and March 2011, and follow-up data were collected the next year. We calculated weight gains over the year and assigned all subjects into one of four groups according to the amount of weight gained: 0–0.99kg weight gain (reference), 1.00–1.99kg, 2.00–2.99kg, and more than 3.00kg. We compared changes in MetS parameters between the reference and other groups using Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).
Results
Significant between-group differences were evident among males in terms of abdominal circumference (AC), blood pressure, and triglyceride (TG) levels. More weight gain was associated with worse results with regard to these MetS parameters. The AC changes were 0.60, 1.55, 2.86, and 4.42cm in the reference group, those who gained 1.00–1.99kg, those who gained 2.00–2.99kg, and those who gained over 3.00kg, respectively; the differences between the reference group and all other groups were significant (all p values <0.001).
Conclusions
Weight gain (in kg) is a useful index of weight change and influences several parameters of MetS even over the course of 1 year."

Aim
Recent studies highlight barriers of diabetes educational programs in Iran and also present some successful experiences carried out for improving the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of type-2 diabetic patients. Hence, evaluation of patients’ KAP seems to be needed. We designed a multicenter study evaluating level of KAP in type-2 diabetic patients in the capital city of Tehran and identifying variables that affect this KAP level.
Methods
This multicenter analytical cross-sectional study was approved by Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences Ethics Committee. Questionnaires were designed for evaluation of diabetes-related KAP in patients. After validating the questionnaires by endocrinologists, test–retest method was used for questionnaire reliability by checking in 15 diabetic patients. Two hundred type-2 diabetic patients admitted to 4 hospitals of Tehran filled out the questionnaires. Using SPSS software, the level of KAP and its confounders were evaluated in patients.
Results
Two hundred type-2 diabetic patients with the mean age of 60.17 years were evaluated (106 male and 94 female). The mean diabetes duration was 13.06 years. The levels of patients’ good knowledge, attitude, and practice were 61.41%, 50.44% and 52.23%, respectively. Age, treatment methods, DM duration, and existence of diabetic retinopathy had significant correlations with KAP level.
Conclusions
The results of this study showed that recent educational programs in Iran improved KAP level. Patients’ KAP increases as their condition worsens/progresses. Hence education should be considered as a priority for newly diagnosed patients and those with lower KAP levels before occurrence of diabetes complications."

Approximately 10–15% of diabetic patients developed foot ulcers at some state in their life and 15% of all load in amputations are performed in patients with diabetes. There is a need to provide extensive education to both primary care physicians and the patients regarding the relationship between glucose control and complications encountered in the foot and ankle. The management of diabetic foot disease is focussed primarily on avoiding amputation of lower extremities and should be carried out through three main strategies; identification of the “at risk” foot, treatment of acutely diseased foot, and prevention of further problems. These are several obstacles in the management of DFI that include poor knowledge and awareness of diabetes and its complications, lack of appropriate podiatry services. These goals are possible only by the establishment of a dedicated team of podiatrist, endocrinologist, vascular surgeon and a pedorthist. The plastic surgeons, orthopaedic surgeons & diabetes teaching nurses/educator dedicated to foot care could be a part of the team. Identifying the patients with diabetes at risk for ulceration requires feet examination, including the vascular & neurological systems, skin conditions, and foot structure. Conservative management of foot problems has dramatically reduced the risk of amputation by simple procedures, such as appropriate foot wear, cleanliness, aggressive surgical debridement, regular wound dressing by simple wet-to-dry saline guage, and ulcer management."

Epidemiological studies suggest that vitamin D status influences type 2 diabetes mellitus. We investigate the metabolic effects of vitamin D.
Material and methods
We studied consecutive type 2 diabetic patients without insulin therapy with vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) lower than 20ng/ml). They were treated with 16,000IU of calcifediol orally once a week for a minimum of 8 weeks.
Results
Twenty eight patients were treated for a mean time of 84.1 days (range 56 to 120 days). All patients achieved serum levels of 25(OH)D higher than 20ng/ml. There was a significant reduction in fasting glucose (145.6±35.5 vs. 131.7±30.4mg/dl, p<0.001). There were small non-significant reductions in HbA1c, fasting insulin and Homeostasis Model Assesment (HOMA)-insulin resistance (IR). There were small non-significant increases in HOMA-insulin sensitivity (S) and HOMA-beta cell function (B) and a small significant increase in Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI).
Conclusions
Correction of vitamin D deficiency in type 2 diabetic patients decreases fasting glucose. Our results do not rule out improvements in metabolic control, insulin-resistance and function of the beta cell."

abstract = "Background
Although optimizing glycemic and non-glycemic targets reduced micro- and macro-vascular complications in type 2 diabetes, multiple barriers hinder turning evidence into practice. Mounting evidence suggests that those with onset of disease in early or mid-adult life, compared with those with onset at an older age, may have a more severe disease course and worse glycemic control.
Aims & objective
We tested the hypothesis that those diagnosed at younger age would have worse glycemic control, even after adjustment for duration of diabetes, higher BMI and other known risk factors for worse glycemic control.
Materials & methods
A cross-sectional analysis of 560 type 2 diabetic subjects from North Indian populace in the year 1999–2012 who reported to endocrine clinic was performed. Sixty patients did not report in the successive year and final data analyses were done in 500 patients attending clinic regularly over a period of 10 years for evaluation of glycemic and non-glycemic targets. They were followed up at 3 monthly intervals with all patients undergoing anthropometric measurement (BMI (weight in kg/height in m2), diet and lifestyle advice by a diabetic educator and consultation by endocrinologist. Fasting and postprandial plasma glucose, A1c (3 monthly), besides evaluation of SMBG that was performed in 50% of these patients regularly. Fasting lipids, S. creatinine and microalbuminuria were assessed annually and blood pressure recoding was done at each visit. The treatment was modified as per the investigation reports. We classified age at diabetes diagnosis as younger (<60 years) vs older (≥60 years). The primary outcome of interest was HbA1c ≥9%. Secondary outcomes were HbA1c ≥8% to <9% and HbA1c ≥7% to <8%.
Results
After adjustment for sex, duration of diabetes, hyperglycemic medications, BMI, co-morbid conditions, age <60 years at diagnosis remains significantly associated with greater odds of HbA1c ≥9% [OR 0.95(0.84–1.07)], HbA1c ≥8% to <9% [OR 1.04(0.93–1.15)] and HbA1c ≥7% to <8% [OR 1.05(0.85–1.17)] for female sex. Seventy two (72.7%) of patients <60 years achieved BP <140/90mmHg (p<0.001) as compared to 62.3% of patients ≥60 years who achieved BP <150/90mmHg (p<0.001) and LDL-cholesterol <100mg/dl in 33.7% patients and 39.1% respectively (p<0.002).
Conclusion
Younger age (<60 years) at type 2 diabetes diagnosis is significantly associated with worse subsequent glycemic control and lipid control, as younger patients at diagnosis have fewer competing co-morbidities and complications. As patient-centeredness is a priority in type 2 diabetes care, safe, aggressive and individualized treatment could benefit this higher-risk group."

It included 378 diabetes patients seeking care from two hospitals in Ghana. Standard methods and tools were used to assess participants’ weight, height, waist circumference (WC), blood pressure (BP) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG). Weight management behaviours were measured using a questionnaire.
Results
The prevalence of general obesity, abdominal obesity and hypertension was 20.1%, 46.6% and 67.7% respectively. Abdominal obesity was more likely in participants who: skipped breakfast, engaged in exercise to lose weight and were generally overweight/obese. General overweight and obesity was more likely in participants who: reported receipt of weight management counselling, engaged in exercise to lose weight, had a weight management plan/goal, and were abdominally obese. Hypertension was less likely in participants who had: no formal education, diabetes for ≥5 years and modified their dietary habits to lose weight but more likely in those who skipped breakfast.

Aims
To compare adiposity indices and to assess their various cut-off values for the prediction of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in postmenopausal women.
Methods
One hundred forty nine volunteers (67.17±6.12 years) underwent body composition assessment using DXA and had 5 anthropometric indices measured (Waist Circumference, WC; Waist-to-Height Ratio, WHtR; Body Mass Index, BMI; Body Adiposity Index, BAI; and Conicity Index). Blood pressure was assessed using an oscillometric device and fasting blood samples were collected. MetS was classified according NCEP-ATP III. Cut-off values to predict MetS were obtained using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analyses and odds ratios were also calculated.
Results
MetS prevalence was 29.5% and subjects who were classified with MetS showed worse cardiometabolic outcomes and higher anthropometric indices values (p<0.05). With the exception of total- and LDL-cholesterol, all remaining variables were significantly correlated with at least one of the adiposity indices, with the strongest relationships observed for the indices reflecting central body fat. The cut-off values were 88cm, 0.57cm/cm, 26.85kg/m2, 43.7%, 36.34%, and 1.24 units for WC, WHtR, BMI, DXA-derived body fat percentage, BAI, and conicity index, respectively. Significant greater risks for MetS were found for volunteers who had WHtR (odds=9.08; CI: 1.81–45.47) or WC (odds=5.20; CI: 1.30–20.73) measurements above cut-off values.
Conclusion
Adiposity indices are associated with MetS in postmenopausal women in different degrees. Indices which consider central adiposity such as WC and WHtR have a stronger relationship with MetS compared to DXA-derived body fat percentage, which is considered a gold standard."

To determine the effect of genetic variants within the FTO gene (rs9939609) on obesity related traits and type 2 diabetes in South Asian population of Karachi, Pakistan.
Methods
A case-control study was conducted at Baqai Institute of Diabetology and Endocrinology (BIDE), Baqai Medical University situated in Karachi. A total of 296 patients with known type 2 diabetes and 198 controls aged greater than and equal to 45 years were recruited. The Anthropometric, clinical and biochemical data was collected on a structured questionnaire. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in FTO gene was identified by Amplification Refractory Mutation System-Polymerase Chain Reaction (ARMS-PCR). Association between the single nucleotide polymorphism and categorical variables such as type 2 diabetes and obesity category was tested through logistic regression analysis.
Results
We observed a strong association of the minor allele A at rs9939609 with type 2 diabetes. Significant difference was observed in frequency of FTO genotype when diabetic subjects were compared with controls in co dominant, dominant and recessive models. This association remained significant even after adjusting for body mass index (BMI) and for waist circumference. The frequency of homozygous risk Alleles (AA) was found to be higher in obese & overweight (≥23kg/m2) and females with central obesity in our study population. The association of FTO variant with BMI and central obesity does not reach to statistical significance.
Conclusion
In the study population of South Asian ancestry, variants of the FTO gene predispose to type 2 diabetes, but not entirely through their effect on BMI."

Results and conclusion
The participants’ mean age was 42.17±10.65 years. The prevalence of Met Syn according to ATP III, IDF and AHA criteria was 26.1%, 35.2% and 31.6% respectively. 6.6% of drivers were impaired fasting glucose. The drivers with the bus, minibus, taxi formed the greatest number of smokers (82.9%) among all drivers (p=0.023). The average of body mass index (BMI) was 26.2±4.06. The most prevalence of Mets according to IDF criteria were observed in drivers of heavy vehicles and also the ones of passenger vehicles, with 36.7% and 43.9% respectively. Based on high prevalence of Met Syn and other risk factors in this study, and considering these factors, should be more careful about this point. It is recommended to control risk factors such as, control of high BMI and TG, LDL, waist circumfernce, education."

Aims
Serum chemerin concentrations are elevated in obese individuals and may play a role in type 2 diabetes. Exercise improves insulin sensitivity, which may be related to changes in chemerin. This study explored how an acute bout of aerobic exercise affected chemerin levels in non-diabetic obese adults.
Methods
Blood samples from 11 obese adults were obtained during two separate conditions: sedentary (SED) and exercise (EX; 60–65% VO2peak). Samples were drawn at baseline, immediately following exercise and hourly for an additional 2h. ANOVA was used to test for differences in chemerin between conditions.
Results
Unadjusted analysis showed no difference in overall change (baseline to 2h post) in chemerin between conditions. During the 2-h post-exercise period, chemerin decreased to 12% below baseline, compared to a 2.5% increase above baseline during that time period on the sedentary day (p=0.06, difference in post-to-2h change between conditions). Controlling for homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), a significant difference existed between EX and SED in the change in chemerin from baseline to 2-h post (p=0.02). Stratified analyses showed a consistent exercise-induced decrease in chemerin among non-insulin resistant subjects, while chemerin increased during exercise among insulin resistant subjects, and then decreased post-exercise.
Conclusion
An acute bout of exercise in obese individuals may elicit a drop in chemerin levels during the post-exercise period, and this response may vary based on insulin resistance."

Aims
Non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) is gaining importance over low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as cardiovascular risk marker in patients with type 2 diabetes. It represents the overall lipid burden and is a surrogate marker for the apolipoprotein B. We studied the discordance between the old (LDL-C) and the new (non-HDL-C) lipid markers in a large group of diabetes patients.
Methods
The lipid profile data of all diabetes (T2DM, aged 18–75, using oral or injectable anti diabetic agents) patients was analyzed in this study. We excluded patients with type1 diabetes, secondary forms of diabetes and gestational diabetes. Elevated lipid parameters (LDL>100mg/dL and non HDL-C>130mg/dL) were defined as per the guidelines of Adult Treatment Panel III.
Results
The study participants (409 M:360 F) had a mean age of 47.3±12.4 years, BMI of 28.4±5.6kg/m2 and an A1c of 8.8±2.2%. Elevated LDL-C was observed in 383 patients (49.8%) and elevated non HDL-C in 418 (54.4%) patients. Of the 383 patients with elevated LDL-C, 346 (90.3%) had corresponding elevated levels of non-HDL-C and out of 418 patients with elevated non HDL-C, 346 (83%) had elevated LDL-C. Discordance between the elevated LDL-C and non-HDL-C values were greater among patients with low triglyceride levels when compared with those with high triglycerides (Pearson's χ2 test=67.7; P<0.001).
Conclusion
Our data suggest a significant discordance between the LDL-C and non-HDL-C in patients with diabetes. This discordance leads to the residual cardiovascular risk in diabetes patients."

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major cause of liver-related morbidity and is frequently associated with insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) syndrome. Recently serum gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) has been considered as surrogate marker of NAFLD leading to oxidative stress and hepatocellular damage. In the present study we examined the association of serum GGT and HOMA-IR with NAFLD in Bangladeshi adult subjects.
Materials and methods
Under a cross-sectional analytical design a total of 110 subjects were recruited who came for their routine health check up in the BIHS Hospital, Darussalam, Dhaka, Bangladesh. After whole abdomen ultrasonography, 62 were diagnosed as non-NAFLD and 48 were NAFLD subjects. Serum glucose was measured by glucose-oxidase method, lipid profile and liver enzymes by enzymatic colorimetric method, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), serum insulin were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. HOMA-IR was calculated by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA).
Results
NAFLD subjects had significantly higher levels of GGT and HOMA-IR as compared to their non-NAFLD counterparts. Multiple linear regression analysis showed a significant positive association of HOMA-IR with GGT after adjusting the effects of waist circumference (WC) and HbA1c. In binary logistic regression analysis, HOMA-IR and GGT were found to be significant determinants of NAFLD after adjusting the effects of WC and HbA1c.
Conclusion
These results suggest that elevated levels of GGT and insulin resistance are more likely to develop NAFLD and thus support a role of these determinants in the pathogenesis of NAFLD in Bangladeshi adult subjects."

Sustained hyperglycemia is a causative factor for glycation of proteins. Glycated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is strongly associated with an increased risk of CAD (Coronary Artery Disease) in diabetics. Hence, we planned to evaluate the association of glycated apo B with subclinical atherosclerosis.
Method
Forty-five non obese and 45 obese diabetics were recruited. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were estimated by HPLC (High Pressure Liquid Chromatography) and small dense low-density lipoprotein (sdLDL) was calculated using standard formula. Plasma Insulin was done by RIA. Insulin resistance was calculated using homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) model. Glycated apo B in serum was estimated using ELISA. Carotid intimal media thickness (CIMT) was estimated using B mode USG of carotid arteries.
Results
Glycated apo B levels were correlated significantly with fasting blood glucose (FBG) (p=0.001), post prandial glucose (PPG) (p=0.001), HbA1c (p=0.013). The percent glycated apo B levels correlated significantly with FBG (p=0.032), PPG (p=0.004) in obese diabetic group. Multivariate regression analysis of glycated apo B and percent glycated apo B, showed that glycated apo B (p=0.009) and percent glycated apo B (p=0.006) were significantly correlated to FPG in diabetic population. The percent glycated apo B was also significantly correlated to PPG (p=0.003) and sdLDL (p=0.009). CIMT levels were higher in obese diabetics with 2 plaques positive when compared to obese non diabetic controls; however levels were not statistically significant.
Conclusion
Persistent hyperglycemia and sdLDL are independently associated with glycation of apo B. Presence of plaques and increased thickness of intima indicates that glycated apo B predisposes diabetics to atherosclerosis."

In its guidelines, the International Diabetes Federation advocates for three different levels of care based on availability of resources. This study investigates the differences in intermediate health outcomes between two diabetes care programs: one a comprehensive diabetes centre, the other a limited care setting. The comprehensive centre offers telemedicine and periodic diabetes education, empowering patients and providing 24-hour advice on lifestyle modifications, diet, and exercise. All patients of this centre practice self-monitoring of blood glucose. The subjects in the limited care setting receive minimal investigations and periodic physical follow-ups, and few patients have access to home glucose monitoring. The results showed that HbA1c (7.62 vs. 8.58, p=0.003), cholesterol (134.4 vs. 173.4, p<0.001), and diastolic blood pressure (72.9 vs. 77.0, p=0.016) were significantly lower in patients receiving comprehensive care, while the reductions in systolic blood pressure (134.6 vs. 138.7, p=0.202) did not achieve statistical significance. These reductions, which remained significant after correcting for confounding factors, could be attributed to more aggressive treatment regimens in the comprehensive care centre, as well as the real-time, frequent communication with medical professionals in the telemedicine program."

Insulin sensitizers might influence oxidative stress to improve insulin resistance in diabetes mellitus. The present study was designed with the aim to study the effect of Metformin & Pioglitazone on markers of oxidative stress after 4 weeks of therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (Type 2 DM).
Research design and methods
This was a prospective study with follow up of 4 weeks in patients with Type 2 DM. They were randomized into metformin treated group (N=20) and Pioglitazone treated group (N=20) and healthy age-matched control group (N=20). Data was presented as mean±S.D. Student “t” test, ANOVA and Pearson correlation co-efficient tests were performed to analyze the parametric data in this study.
Results
Baseline clinical characteristics of the two study groups were similar. There is a significant difference for Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2h-Post Prandial Plasma Glucose (PPPG) after 30 days of metformin and pioglitazone treatment. Metformin significantly reduced MDA (p=0.041) and increased SOD (p<0.001). Pioglitazone significantly reduced MDA (p<0.001) but failed to raise SOD level (p=0.132). Mean MDA was 4.57±0.57μM/L in metformin and 2.91±0.66μM/L in pioglitazone treatment with a p-value of <0.001. Further, a similar significant difference was obtained for SOD value by metformin and pioglitazone treatment (7.87±0.72U/ml vs. 6.94±0.53U/ml; p<0.001).
Conclusion
Pioglitazone was superior to Metformin to improve oxidative stress as reflected by reduction in MDA but the antioxidant effect i.e. increase in SOD was seen with metformin only. The differing mechanism of actions of the two drugs on oxidative stress favors co prescription of these drugs for better outcome in improving insulin resistance and diabetic complications."

Metabolic syndrome progresses to diabetes and determinants of this progression like hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia and genetic factors have been speculative. The present study was aimed at quantifying the insulin resistance and influence of family history of diabetes in subjects with metabolic syndrome developing prediabetes and diabetes.
Methods
Consecutive subjects attending the endocrine clinic were evaluated for metabolic syndrome as per definition of International Diabetes Federation, 2005. The family history of diabetes in their first degree relatives was ascertained and Homeostasis model assessment of Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), Homeostasis model assessment for beta cell function (HOMA-B) and Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) were calculated in 163 subjects enrolled.
Results
HOMA-IR was higher (p<0.05) but HOMA-B and QUICKI were lower (p<0.0001) in subjects with metabolic syndrome+prediabetes or diabetes compared to metabolic syndrome with normal glucose tolerance. HOMA-B was lower and prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes was higher in metabolic syndrome subjects with family history of diabetes than in those without such family history (p<0.05).
Conclusions
subjects with metabolic syndrome having prediabetes and diabetes had more severe insulin resistance than those with metabolic syndrome only. Beta cell dysfunction was remarkable and prevalence of prediabetes was high in metabolic syndrome subjects with family history of diabetes. Both the severity of the insulin resistance and family history of diabetes are therefore proposed to be determinants of diminished Beta cell function leading to diabetes in metabolic syndrome."

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have a well-known effect on glycaemic control in patients with diabetes but little is known on their wound healing role in this group of population. This paper reviews the effects of DPP-4 inhibitors on wound healing of diabetic foot ulcers.
Methods
Published data on effects and mechanism of DDP-4 inhibitors on wound healing were derived from Medline, PubMed and Google Scholar search of English language literature from 1994 to 2014 using the key words such as “DPP-4 inhibitors”, “endothelial healing” “diabetes” and “chronic ulcers”.
Results
DPP-4 inhibitors show a potential benefit in processes of wound healing in diabetic chronic foot ulcers. The enzyme inhibitors promote recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells and allow the final scaffolding of wounds. Furthermore DPP-4 inhibitors augment angiogenesis and have widespread effects on optimising the immune response to persistent hypoxia in chronic diabetes wounds.
Conclusion
DPP-4 inhibitors show promise in the local wound healing of diabetic foot ulcers in addition to its already established glycaemic control. In the light of high rate of amputations due to non-healing ulcers with profound psychological and economical liability, more investigations on the usefulness of DPP-4 inhibitors in the high risk diabetes population are needed."

Cardiac autonomic dysfunction (CAD) is associated with both prediabetes and metabolic syndrome (MS). Heart rate variability (HRV) and heart rate turbulence (HRT) are reliable 24-h Holter-ECG findings of cardiac autonomic function. This study aimed to investigate the relation between MS and its components and CAD using HRV and HRT.
Materials and methods
The study included 80 non-diabetic patients with MS and 70 control subjects. All study population and the patients with MS were further analyzed for each diagnostic component of MS to investigate which criteria impaired HRV and HRT.
Results
HRV and HRT parameters were disturbed in patients in the MS group. While impairment in HRV and HRT was significantly related to the presence of the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) criterion, there were no differences between groups in terms of the other 4 MS criteria. Moreover, FPG level was significantly correlated with SDNN (r=−0.352, p<0.001), SDNN index (r=−0.423, p<0.001), SDANN (r=−0.301, p<0.001), RMSSD (r=−0.237, p<0.001), pNN50 (r=−0.237, p<0.001), turbulence onset (TO) (r=0.365, p<0.001) and turbulence slope (TS) (r=−0.365, p<0.001). Among the MS diagnostic criteria, only FPG level was an independent determinant of all HRV and HRT parameters.
Conclusions
This study confirms the relation between MS and CAD. Increased FPG alone appears to be responsible for the mentioned findings among the 5 diagnostic criteria. Accordingly, CAD may be the result of prediabetes, not MS in patients with MS."

Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is autoimmune diabetes with a slow progression characterized by the presence of antibodies associated with Type I diabetes. The present study aimed to assess autoimmune characteristics in patients with LADA in Iran. We attempted to obtain a clear view of autoimmune conditions in LADA among our population.
Methods
This study was sourced from the population-based survey of KERCARDS aiming assessment of cardiovascular risk factors among a great sample of Iranian population who were resident in Kerman, a great province in southern Iran. Among all diabetic patients who were negative for Anti Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase (GAD) antibody test, 120 were selected as the controls and among 80 patients who were positive for this test diagnosed as LADA, the recorded files of 57 patients were complete considered as the cases.
Results
The level of thyroxin is significantly lower in patients with LADA compared with the controls so 73.7% and 45% of patients had normal level of thyroxin, respectively. Also, those with LADA had considerably lower levels of both thyroid peroxydaseantibody (TPO-Ab) and C-peptide when compared with non-LADA group. Using multivariate analyses and with the presence of baseline variables including gender, age, and duration of disease, the diagnosis of LADA was associated with lower serum levels of Anti-TPO, C-peptide, and thyroxin, but not associated with the level of Anti-TTG in serum.
Conclusion
LADA patients may face with lower serum levels of C-peptide and thyroid-specific antibodies indicating insulin therapy requirement and authoimmune fundaments of the disease, respectively."

Methods
The proportions of Japanese patients with an unmet need of diabetes management, defined as not achieving an HbA1c<7% despite having a fasting plasma glucose (FPG)<130mg/dL, and without an unmet need, defined as having an endpoint HbA1c<7%, regardless of FPG level, were determined for the ALOHA study population, which was conducted as a post-marketing survey for insulin glargine in Japan. For the meta-analysis, all Asian modified intent-to-treat patients with baseline and endpoint HbA1c measurements reported from the 3 GetGoal trials were included.
Results
Among 1013 Japanese type 2 diabetes patients in the ALOHA study, 36% had an unmet need. In the GetGoal-Duo1, -L, and L-Asia trials, 237 Asian patients were treated with lixisenatide add-on treatment to basal insulin and 226 received placebo.

The existence of early factors which, acting during critical periods of intrauterine or immediate postnatal development, determine long-term health has become increasingly recognized. Both high and low birth weight have been associated with cardiovascular risk factors in adulthood. Therefore, body composition at birth rather than birth weight may be a marker to predict future diseases. Maternal weight previous to and gained during pregnancy is associated with intrauterine fetal growth.
Objective
To evaluate the correlation between maternal nutritional status before and during pregnancy and neonatal body composition.
Material and methods
We studied consecutive mother–child pairs at delivery at an Argentinean public hospital during 5 months period, evaluating maternal and neonatal anthropometry before 24h of life as well as the history of the mother before and during pregnancy. Neonatal body composition was calculated according to a mathematical formula based on skinfold thickness measurement validated in newborns.
Results
Mothers of newborns with high body fat mass were more frequently obese (72.7% versus 35.1%, p 0.005), and more frequently showed weight gain above 18kg during pregnancy (76.4% versus 31%, p 0.03).

The sample was 5190 individuals aged 40–64 years participated in the first phase of the Shahroud eye cohort study. Prevalence of MS was determined in terms of the age and sex. Other variables were evaluated by using simple and multiple logistic regression methods.
Results
The prevalence of MS was 10.88% in men, 13.03% in women and 12.14% in total. The prevalence proportion increased with increasing age. In multivariate logistic regression model, age (odds ratio (OR)=1.06), education (OR=0.98) and smoking (OR=0.50), had significant effects on MS. In this model, gender, marital status and economic status had no significant effect on MS. Higher prevalence of obesity and overweight in non-smokers (79.9%) compare to smokers (47.4%, P<0.001), indicated that the association of smoking and MS is confounded.
Conclusions
Despite the low prevalence of MS in this study, older age was associated with increased risk of developing MS and higher education was associated with decreased this risk, therefore health education, changing the lifestyle, and taking greater attention in elderly is needed in order to prevent the MS and its complications."

Objective
This study investigates the relationship between change in job status and mortality of newly diagnosed type II diabetes patients by gender.
Methods
Newly onset of individuals diagnosed with type II diabetes in the years 2003 and 2004, had 7 years follow-up using National Health Insurance Corporation (NHIC) sample cohort data. The individuals diagnosed with type II diabetes within this period were 14,861. After adjusting for age, initial income group, insulin treatment and medical service utilization, hazard ratio was analyzed using Cox's proportional hazard model.
Results
Mortality hazard ratio of continuously unemployed individuals is 3.78 times higher in males and 9.78 times higher in females than in those who keep their jobs. Also, individuals with a change in job status (e.g. from industrial worker to unemployed or self-employed), the mortality hazard ratio is 2.24 times higher in males and 5.23 times higher in females than in those who keep their jobs. The impact of change in job status change is largest for the middle class males. The middle class males has the higher mortality hazard ratio, 6.14 times in maintain unemployed and 4.12 times in change his job (industrial worker to unemployed or self-employer) than maintain one's job.
Conclusions
The continuous unemployment and the loss of job are related to risk of death in diabetic patients. The impact of unemployed is stronger than job change (loss or change). The impact of job status change is largest for the middle class man."

Insigniﬁcant difference (P=0.493) was reported in age (50±4.7 year compared with 50±7.2 year), while body mass Index (23±2kg/m2 compared with 26±4.5kg/m2) between the T2DM subjects and control subject showed significant difference (<0.0001). Inverse Pearson correlation coefficient, r (−0.376), (−0.689), (−0.05), (−0.05), (−0.40), (−0.14), (−0.342) and (−0.548) were established when HbA1c of control and T2DM patients were compared with control and T2DM patients of serum Cr, Zn, Mg and SOD variables in that order. The overall “p”-value demonstrated highly signiﬁcant result at p<0.0001 between the T2DM subjects and controls.
Conclusion
Strong association between serum chromium and SOD in relation to HbA1c in this study gives a strong point that these variables could be used as markers of cell injury with the intention in further part of life en route to progressive complications in T2DM."

abstract = "Summary
Obesity and its complications are emerging in an epidemic manner in Latin American countries.
Aims
To estimate the prevalence of Cardio-Metabolic Risk Factors (CMRFs) and Metabolic Syndrome (MS) in overweight/obese (OW/OB) and normal weight (NW) adolescents and to examine the associated variables.
Material and methods
A cross-sectional comparative study was conducted in two groups of children, between 10 and 19 years of age, in seven Argentine provinces. A survey on dietary habits, physical activity, anthropometric and biochemical data was collected to identify CMRF and MS. The WHO definition adapted to children was used.
Results
1009 children were assessed; 398 were male (39.4%), 601 (59.6%) were NW and 408 (40.4%) were OW/OB. The OW/OB had a significantly higher proportion of values defined as CMRF: 3.7% impaired fasting glucose >110mg/dl; 27.9% insulin >15 or 20μU/l as they were pubertal/prepubertal; 53.2% Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA)>2.5; 45.6% High Density Lipoprotein (HDL)<40mg/dl; 37.7% TG>110mg/dl and 13.5% hypertension (SBP and/or diastolic Blood Pressure percentile >90). Prevalence of the MS in OW/OB patients was 40.3%. The MS was not observed in NW children. Significant differences were found for: family history of OW/OB, birth weight (BW), age at menarche, presence of acanthosis nigricans, waist circumference (WC) >90th percentile. The WC was positively correlated with BP, TG, insulin, HOMA and Body mass index Z score and negatively with HDL in the study population.
Conclusions
We confirm obesity as a major determinant of CMRF and MS (40%), especially fat centralization. We stress the need to address obesity prevention plans in children and adolescents."

The aim of this study was to determine if osteocalcin is related to adiposity and hyperglycaemia in metabolic syndrome irrespective of the presence of diabetes mellitus.
Materials and Methods
This was a cross sectional study of 90 patients (59 men and 31 women) with metabolic syndrome as defined by the International Diabetes Federation criteria. Based on medical history 50 out of 90 patients had a diabetes. Anthropometric data were collected and blood taken for measurement of osteocalcin, fasting lipids, fasting glucose and insulin resistance (using homeostatic model assessment index, HOMA-IR).
Results
Osteocalcin correlated negatively with fasting glucose (r=−0.366, p<0.001) and HOMA-IR (r=−0.305, p<0.05) but not with waist circumference (r=0.079), body mass index (r=0.028), total cholesterol (r=0.061) or triglycerides (r=0.009). Diabetics had higher HOMA-IR (p<0.01) and lower osteocalcin levels (p<0.01) than non-diabetics. Among diabetics, osteocalcin correlated with glucose only (r=−0.341, p=0.015). In non-diabetics, osteocalcin correlated with HOMA-IR (r=−0.359, p=0.023) via insulin (r=−0.402, p=0.010). Patients with impaired fasting glucose levels (5.6–6.9mmol/L) had the same HOMA-IR as diabetics (p=0.076) but not low osteocalcin (p=0.025).
Conclusions
In this cross-sectional study of subjects with metabolic syndrome and central obesity, low osteocalcin was associated with diabetes but not adiposity."

Exercise plays significant role in the health outcomes of patients with diabetes, however, little is known about patients’ knowledge of exercise for plasma blood glucose control among patients with type-2 diabetes (T2D). This study investigated knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of exercise for plasma blood glucose control among patients with T2D.
Materials and Methods
This cross-sectional study recruited 299 patients with T2D (male=105; female=194) from selected government hospitals in Osun State, Nigeria using purposive sampling technique. Validated questionnaires were used to assess of exercise for plasma blood glucose control and socioeconomic status (SES) of the patients. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Alpha level was set at <0.05.
Results
The mean age of respondents was 51.9±9.8 years. A majority, 245(81.9%) were married individuals and more than half, 195(65.3%) were in the low SES. One hundred and forty-eight (49.5%) had good knowledge of exercise whilst 269(90.0%) had negative attitude to exercise practice. Less than a third, 82(27.4%) engaged in exercise practice for plasma blood glucose control. There was significant association between knowledge and practice of exercise (2=12.535; p=0.002). Furthermore, significant associations were found between knowledge and gender (2=11.453; p=0.003), and socioeconomic status (2=29.127, p=0.001) but not associated with attitude towards exercise (p>0.05).
Conclusion
Patients with demonstrated good knowledge of exercise for plasma blood glucose control but reported negative attitude and poor practice of exercise."

The magnitude of abnormal liver enzymes profile in type 2 diabetic patients is unknown in Algerian west region even though it counts among liver diseases considered as an important cause of death in type 2 diabetes. The main objective is to assess the prevalence of elevated liver enzymes levels among patients with type 2 diabetes from Algerian west region and to determine associated risk factors.
Materials and methods
A descriptive cross sectional study was performed on 180 type 2 diabetic patients in whom anthropometric and biochemical parameters were determined.
Results
Twenty-five patients had abnormal elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) (13.9%) with the gender-wise prevalence being 15.9% (n=17) in women and 10.9% (n=8) in men. The prevalence of abnormal elevated aspartate transaminase (AST), gamma glutamyl transferase and alkaline phosphatase level was respectively 10% (n=18), 6.1% (n=11) and 8.9% (16). High waist circumference (OR: 5, CI: 1.04–24.04) and high blood pressure (OR: 4.86, CI: 0.94–25.12) were only associated with elevated AST. Fasting glucose >1.4g/l were associated both with elevated ALT (OR: 3.03, CI: 0.86–10.67) and AST (OR: 5.7, CI: 1.09–29.8).

This study examined the relationship between precariousness of work, glucose intolerance and psychological wellbeing for male workers, stratified by age.
Materials and Methods
I recruited 2542 manufacturing two-shift workers, aged from 35 to 54 years. Glucose intolerance was defined as fasting plasma glucose of ≥100mg/dL or current medication of diabetes mellitus. The rating scale of General Health Questionnaire 12-item version (GHQ-12) was used for evaluating psychological well-being.
Results
There was a significant increase in the prevalence of glucose intolerance by aging in permanent workers. In addition, the prevalence of glucose intolerance except 30s and the prevalence of positive GHQ-12 scores except 50s of permanent workers were both significantly higher than that of temporary workers in each age class.
Conclusion
Temporary workers in this study sign contracts for 3 years, and heather worker's effect, compared with permanent workers, would be reflected in this study."

abstract = "Summary
The study aim was to evaluate the impact of dysmetabolic comorbidities including subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) on pattern of circulating endothelial-derived microparticles (EMPs) in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients.
Methods
It was retrospectively involved a cohort of 388 patients with CHF. Fifty three CHF subjects had SH and 335 patients were free from thyroid dysfunction. Circulating levels of NT-pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), total and free thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) EMPs were measured at baseline. SH was defined per contemporary clinical guideline as state associated with elevated level of serum TSH>10μU/L and basal normal free T3 and T4 concentration.
Results
Circulating CD31+/annexin V+ EMPs were higher in SH patients compared with none SH subjects. In contrast, activated CD62E+ EMP numbers were not significantly different between both patient cohorts. Using C-statistics for Models with TSH, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, dyslipidemia, and circulating biomarkers (hs-CRP, NT-proBNP, serum uric acid) as Continuous Variables we found that adding of NYHA class alone, NT-proBNP alone or their combination to the based model (TSH) improved the relative integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) for increased CD31+/annexin V+ to CD62E+ ratio by 4.9%; 9.2% and 9.6% respectively. NT-proBNP improves significantly predictive model based on TSH for increased CD31+/annexin V+ to CD62E+ ratio. Among patient study population for category-free net reclassification improvement (NRI), 4% of events (P=0.026) and 6% of non-events (P=0.012) were correctly reclassified by the addition of circulating NT-proBNP to the base model (TSH) for Increased CD31+/annexin V+ to CD62E+ ratio. Therefore, 4% of events (P=0.028) and 5% of non-events (P=0.014) were correctly reclassified using category-free NRI for increased CD31+/annexin V+ to CD62E+ ratio.
Conclusion
We found that SH state in CHF patients associates with impaired pattern of circulating EMPs with predominantly increased number of apoptotic-derived microparticles."
