abstract = "Summary
The Lancet Respiratory Medicine Commission on drug-resistant tuberculosis was published in 2017, which comprehensively reviewed and provided recommendations on various aspects of the disease. Several key new developments regarding drug-resistant tuberculosis are outlined in this Commission Update. The WHO guidelines on treating drug-resistant tuberculosis were updated in 2019 with a reclassification of second line anti-tuberculosis drugs. An injection-free MDR tuberculosis treatment regimen is now recommended. Over the past 3 years, advances in treatment include the recognition of the safety and mortality benefit of bedaquiline, the finding that the 9–11 month injectable-based ‘Bangladesh’ regimen was non-inferior to longer regimens, and promising interim results of a novel 6 month 3-drug regimen (bedaquiline, pretomanid, and linezolid). Studies of explanted lungs from patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis have shown substantial drug-specific gradients across pulmonary cavities, suggesting that alternative dosing and drug delivery strategies are needed to reduce functional monotherapy at the site of disease. Several controversies are discussed including the optimal route of drug administration, optimal number of drugs constituting a regimen, selection of individual drugs for a regimen, duration of the regimen, and minimal desirable standards of antibiotic stewardship. Newer rapid nucleic acid amplification test platforms, including point-of-care systems that facilitate active case-finding, are discussed. The rapid diagnosis of resistance to other drugs, (notably fluoroquinolones), and detection of resistance by targeted or whole genome sequencing will probably change the diagnostic landscape in the near future."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The effect of personalised mechanical ventilation on clinical outcomes in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains uncertain and needs to be evaluated. We aimed to test whether a mechanical ventilation strategy that was personalised to individual patients' lung morphology would improve the survival of patients with ARDS when compared with standard of care.
Methods
We designed a multicentre, single-blind, stratified, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial enrolling patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS in 20 university or non-university intensive care units in France. Patients older than 18 years with early ARDS for less than 12 h were randomly assigned (1:1) to either the control group or the personalised group using a minimisation algorithm and stratified according to the study site, lung morphology, and duration of mechanical ventilation. Only the patients were masked to allocation. In the control group, patients received a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg per predicted bodyweight and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was selected according to a low PEEP and fraction of inspired oxygen table, and early prone position was encouraged. In the personalised group, the treatment approach was based on lung morphology; patients with focal ARDS received a tidal volume of 8 mL/kg, low PEEP, and prone position. Patients with non-focal ARDS received a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg, along with recruitment manoeuvres and high PEEP. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality as established by intention-to-treat analysis. This study is registered online with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02149589.
Findings
From June 12, 2014, to Feb 2, 2017, 420 patients were randomly assigned to treatment. 11 patients were excluded in the personalised group and nine patients were excluded in the control group; 196 patients in the personalised group and 204 in the control group were included in the analysis. In a multivariate analysis, there was no difference in 90-day mortality between the group treated with personalised ventilation and the control group in the intention-to-treat analysis (hazard ratio [HR] 1·01; 95% CI 0·61–1·66; p=0·98). However, misclassification of patients as having focal or non-focal ARDS by the investigators was observed in 85 (21%) of 400 patients. We found a significant interaction between misclassification and randomised group allocation with respect to the primary outcome (p<0·001). In the subgroup analysis, the 90-day mortality of the misclassified patients was higher in the personalised group (26 [65%] of 40 patients) than in the control group (18 [32%] of 57 patients; HR 2·8; 95% CI 1·5–5·1; p=0·012.
Interpretation
Personalisation of mechanical ventilation did not decrease mortality in patients with ARDS, possibly because of the misclassification of 21% of patients. A ventilator strategy misaligned with lung morphology substantially increases mortality. Whether improvement in ARDS phenotyping can decrease mortality should be assessed in a future clinical trial.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Infants are a key target population for new tuberculosis vaccines. We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of the live-attenuated Mycobacterium tuberculosis vaccine candidate MTBVAC in adults and infants in a region where transmission of tuberculosis is very high.
Methods
We did a randomised, double-blind, BCG-controlled, dose-escalation trial at the South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative site near Cape Town, South Africa. Healthy adult community volunteers who were aged 18–50 years, had received BCG vaccination as infants, were HIV negative, had negative interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) results, and had no personal history of tuberculosis or current household contact with someone with tuberculosis were enrolled in a safety cohort. Infants born to HIV-negative women with no personal history of tuberculosis or current household contact with a person with tuberculosis and who were 96 h old or younger, generally healthy, and had not yet received routine BCG vaccination were enrolled in a separate infant cohort. Eligible adults were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either BCG Vaccine SSI (5 × 105 colony forming units [CFU] of Danish strain 1331 in 0·1 mL diluent) or MTBVAC (5 × 105 CFU in 0·1 mL) intradermally in the deltoid region of the arm. After favourable review of 28-day reactogenicity and safety data in the adult cohort, infants were randomly assigned (1:3) to receive either BCG Vaccine SSI (2·5 × 105 CFU in 0·05 mL diluent) or MTBVAC in three sequential cohorts of increasing MTBVAC dose (2·5 × 103 CFU, 2·5 × 104 CFU, and 2·5 × 105 CFU in 0·05 mL) intradermally in the deltoid region of the arm. QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube IGRA was done on days 180 and 360. For both randomisations, a pre-prepared block randomisation schedule was used. Participants (and their parents or guardians in the case of infant participants), investigators, and other clinical and laboratory staff were masked to intervention allocation. The primary outcomes, which were all measured in the infant cohort, were solicited and unsolicited local adverse events and serious adverse events until day 360; non-serious systemic adverse events until day 28 and vaccine-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses on days 7, 28, 70, 180, and 360. Secondary outcomes measured in adults were local injection-site and systemic reactions and haematology and biochemistry at study day 7 and 28. Safety analyses and immunogenicity analyses were done in all participants who received a dose of vaccine. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02729571.
Findings
Between Sept 29, 2015, and Nov 16, 2015, 62 adults were screened and 18 were enrolled and randomly assigned, nine each to the BCG and MTBVAC groups. Between Feb 12, 2016, and Sept 21, 2016, 36 infants were randomly assigned—eight to the BCG group, nine to the 2·5 × 103 CFU MTBVAC group, nine to the 2·5 × 104 CFU group, and ten to the 2·5 × 105 CFU group. Mild injection-site reactions occurred only in infants in the BCG and the 2·5 × 105 CFU MTBVAC group, with no evidence of local or regional injection-site complications. Systemic adverse events were evenly distributed across BCG and MTBVAC dose groups, and were mostly mild in severity. Eight serious adverse events were reported in seven vaccine recipients (one adult MTBVAC recipient, one infant BCG recipient, one infant in the 2·5 × 103 CFU MTBVAC group, two in the 2·5 × 104 CFU MTBVAC group, and two in the 2·5 × 105 CFU MTBVAC group), including one infant in the 2·5 × 103 CFU MTBVAC group treated for unconfirmed tuberculosis and one in the 2·5 × 105 CFU MTBVAC group treated for unlikely tuberculosis. One infant died as a result of possible viral pneumonia. Vaccination with all MTBVAC doses induced durable antigen-specific T-helper-1 cytokine-expressing CD4 cell responses in infants that peaked 70 days after vaccination and were detectable 360 days after vaccination. For the highest MTBVAC dose (ie, 2·5 × 105 CFU), these responses exceeded responses induced by an equivalent dose of the BCG vaccine up to 360 days after vaccination. Dose-related IGRA conversion was noted in three (38%) of eight infants in the 2·5 × 103 CFU MTBVAC group, six (75%) of eight in the 2·5 × 104 CFU MTBVAC group, and seven (78%) of nine in the 2·5 × 105 CFU MTBVAC group at day 180, compared with none of seven infants in the BCG group. By day 360, IGRA reversion had occurred in all three infants (100%) in the 2·5 × 103 CFU MTBVAC group, four (67%) of the six in the 2·5 × 104 CFU MTBVAC group, and three (43%) of the seven in the 2·5 × 105 CFU MTBVAC group.
Interpretation
MTBVAC had acceptable reactogenicity, and induced a durable CD4 cell response in infants. The evidence of immunogenicity supports progression of MTBVAC into larger safety and efficacy trials, but also confounds interpretation of tests for M tuberculosis infection, highlighting the need for stringent endpoint definition.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Reslizumab 3 mg/kg administered intravenously is approved for the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma. We assessed the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous reslizumab 110 mg in two trials in patients with uncontrolled severe asthma and increased blood eosinophils. The aim was to establish whether subcutaneous reslizumab 110 mg can reduce exacerbation rates in these patients (study 1) or reduce maintenance oral corticosteroid dose in patients with corticosteroid-dependent asthma (study 2).
Methods
Both studies were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 studies. Entry criteria for study 1 were uncontrolled severe asthma, two or more asthma exacerbations in the previous year, a blood eosinophil count of 300 cells per μL or more (including no more than 30% patients with an eosinophil count <400 cells/μL), and at least a medium dose of inhaled corticosteroids with one or more additional asthma controllers. Patients in study 2 had severe asthma, a blood eosinophil count of 300 cells per μL or more, daily maintenance oral corticosteroid (prednisone 5–40 mg, or equivalent), and high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus another controller. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to subcutaneous reslizumab (110 mg) or placebo once every 4 weeks for 52 weeks in study 1 and 24 weeks in study 2. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. Primary efficacy outcomes were frequency of exacerbations during 52 weeks in study 1 and categorised percentage reduction in daily oral corticosteroid dose from baseline to weeks 20–24 in study 2. Primary efficacy analyses were by intention to treat, and safety analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. These studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02452190 (study 1) and NCT02501629 (study 2).
Findings
Between Aug 12, 2015, and Jan 31, 2018, 468 patients in study 1 were randomly assigned to placebo (n=232) or subcutaneous reslizumab (n=236), and 177 in study 2 to placebo (n=89) or subcutaneous reslizumab (n=88). In study 1, we found no significant difference in the exacerbation rate between reslizumab and placebo in the intention-to-treat population (rate ratio 0·79, 95% CI 0·56–1·12; p=0·19). Subcutaneous reslizumab reduced exacerbation frequency compared with placebo in the subgroup of patients with blood eosinophil counts of 400 cells per μL or more (0·64, 95% CI 0·43–0·95). Greater reductions in annual exacerbation risk (p=0·0035) and longer time to first exacerbation were observed for patients with higher trough serum reslizumab concentrations. In study 2, we found no difference between placebo and fixed-dose subcutaneous reslizumab in categorised percentage reduction in daily oral corticosteroid dose (odds ratio for a lower category of oral corticosteroid use in the reslizumab group vs the placebo group, 1·23, 95% CI 0·70–2·16; p=0·47). The frequency of adverse events and serious adverse events with reslizumab were similar to those with placebo in both studies.
Interpretation
Fixed-dose (110 mg) subcutaneous reslizumab was not effective in reducing exacerbation frequency in patients with uncontrolled asthma and increased blood eosinophils (≥300 cells/μL), or in reducing the daily maintenance oral corticosteroid dose in patients with oral corticosteroid-dependent severe eosinophilic asthma. Higher exposures than those observed with 110 mg subcutaneous reslizumab are required to achieve maximal efficacy.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The importance of lung recruitment before surfactant administration has been shown in animal studies. Well designed trials in preterm infants are absent. We aimed to examine whether the application of a recruitment manoeuvre just before surfactant administration, followed by rapid extubation (intubate-recruit-surfactant-extubate [IN-REC-SUR-E]), decreased the need for mechanical ventilation during the first 72 h of life compared with no recruitment manoeuvre (ie, intubate-surfactant-extubate [IN-SUR-E]).
Methods
We did a randomised, unblinded, controlled trial in 35 tertiary neonatal intensive care units in Italy. Spontaneously breathing extremely preterm neonates (24 + 0 to 27 + 6 weeks' gestation) reaching failure criteria for continuous positive airway pressure within the first 24 h of life were randomly assigned (1:1) with a minimisation algorithm to IN-REC-SUR-E or IN-SUR-E using an interactive web-based electronic system, stratified by clinical site and gestational age. The primary outcome was the need for mechanical ventilation in the first 72 h of life. Analyses were done in intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations, with a log-binomial regression model correcting for stratification factors to estimate adjusted relative risk (RR). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02482766.
Findings
Of 556 infants assessed for eligibility, 218 infants were recruited from Nov 12, 2015, to Sept 23, 2018, and included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The requirement for mechanical ventilation during the first 72 h of life was reduced in the IN-REC-SUR-E group (43 [40%] of 107) compared with the IN-SUR-E group (60 [54%] of 111; adjusted RR 0·75, 95% CI 0·57–0·98; p=0·037), with a number needed to treat of 7·2 (95% CI 3·7–135·0). The addition of the recruitment manoeuvre did not adversely affect the safety outcomes of in-hospital mortality (19 [19%] of 101 in the IN-REC-SUR-E group vs 37 [33%] of 111 in the IN-SUR-E group), pneumothorax (four [4%] of 101 vs seven [6%] of 111), or grade 3 or worse intraventricular haemorrhage (12 [12%] of 101 vs 17 [15%] of 111).
Interpretation
A lung recruitment manoeuvre just before surfactant administration improved the efficacy of surfactant treatment in extremely preterm neonates compared with the standard IN-SUR-E technique, without increasing the risk of adverse neonatal outcomes. The reduced need for mechanical ventilation during the first 72 h of life might facilitate implementation of a non-invasive respiratory support strategy.

African ancestry is associated with a higher prevalence and greater severity of asthma than European ancestries, yet genetic studies of the most common locus associated with childhood-onset asthma, 17q12–21, in African Americans have been inconclusive.

We first did a genetic association study and meta-analysis using 17q12–21 tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for childhood-onset asthma in 1613 European American and 870 African American children from the CREW consortium. Nine tag SNPs were selected based on linkage disequilibrium patterns at 17q12–21 and their association with asthma, considering the effect allele under an additive model (0, 1, or 2 effect alleles). Results were meta-analysed with publicly available summary data from the EVE consortium (on 4303 European American and 3034 African American individuals) for seven of the nine SNPs of interest. Subsequently, we tested for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) among the SNPs associated with childhood-onset asthma and the expression of 17q12–21 genes in resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 85 African American CREW children and in upper airway epithelial cells from 246 African American CREW children; and in lower airway epithelial cells from 44 European American and 72 African American adults from a case-control study of asthma genetic risk in Chicago (IL, USA).
Findings
17q12–21 SNPs were broadly associated with asthma in European Americans. Only two SNPs (rs2305480 in gasdermin-B [GSDMB] and rs8076131 in ORMDL sphingolipid biosynthesis regulator 3 [ORMDL3]) were associated with asthma in African Americans, at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p<0·0055 (for rs2305480_G, odds ratio [OR] 1·36 [95% CI 1·12–1·65], p=0·0014; and for rs8076131_A, OR 1·37 [1·13–1·67], p=0·0010). In upper airway epithelial cells from African American children, genotype at rs2305480 was the most significant eQTL for GSDMB (eQTL effect size [β] 1·35 [95% CI 1·25–1·46], p<0·0001), and to a lesser extent showed an eQTL effect for post-GPI attachment to proteins phospholipase 3 (β 1·15 [1·08–1·22], p<0·0001). No SNPs were eQTLs for ORMDL3. By contrast, in PBMCs, the five core SNPs were associated only with expression of GSDMB and ORMDL3. Genotype at rs12936231 (in zona pellucida binding protein 2) showed the strongest associations across both genes (for GSDMB, eQTLβ 1·24 [1·15–1·32], p<0·0001; and for ORMDL3 (β 1·19 [1·12–1·24], p<0·0001). The eQTL effects of rs2305480 on GSDMB expression were replicated in lower airway cells from African American adults (β 1·29 [1·15–1·44], p<0·0001).
Interpretation
Our study suggests that SNPs regulating GSDMB expression in airway epithelial cells have a major role in childhood-onset asthma, whereas SNPs regulating the expression levels of 17q12–21 genes in resting blood cells are not central to asthma risk. Our genetic and gene expression data in African Americans and European Americans indicated GSDMB to be the leading candidate gene at this important asthma locus.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The evidence base for the treatment of mild obstructive sleep apnoea is limited and definitions of disease severity vary. The MERGE trial investigated the clinical effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure in patients with mild obstructive sleep apnoea.
Methods
MERGE, a multicentre, parallel, randomised controlled trial enrolled patients (≥18 years to ≤80 years) with mild obstructive sleep apnoea (apnoea-hypopnoea index [AHI] ≥5 to ≤15 events per h using either AASM 2007 or AASM 2012 scoring criteria) from 11 UK sleep centres. Participants were assigned (1:1) to either 3 months of continuous positive airway pressure plus standard care (sleep counselling), or standard care alone, by computer-generated randomisation; neither participants nor researchers were blinded. The primary outcome was a change in the score on the Short Form-36 questionnaire vitality scale in the intention-to-treat population of patients with mild obstructive sleep apnoea diagnosed using the American Academy of Sleep Medicine 2012 scoring criteria. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02699463.
Findings
Between Nov 28, 2016 and Feb 12, 2019, 301 patients were recruited and randomised. 233 had mild obstructive sleep apnoea using AASM 2012 criteria and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis: 115 were allocated to receive continuous positive airway pressure and 118 to receive standard care. 209 (90%) of these participants completed the trial. The vitality score significantly increased with a treatment effect of a mean of 10·0 points (95% CI 7·2–12·8; p<0·0001) after 3 months of continuous positive airway pressure, compared with standard care alone (9·2 points [6·8 to 11·6] vs −0·8 points [–3·2 to 1·5]). Using the ANCOVA last-observation-carried-forward analysis, a more conservative estimate, the vitality score also significantly increased with a treatment effect of a mean of 7·5 points (95% CI 5·3 to 9·6; p<0·0001) after 3 months of continuous positive airway pressure, compared with standard care alone (7·5 points [6·0 to 9·0] vs 0·0 points [–1·5 to 1·5]). Three serious adverse events occurred (one allocated to the continuous positive airway pressure group) and all were unrelated to the intervention.
Interpretation
3 months of treatment with continuous positive airway pressure improved the quality of life in patients with mild obstructive sleep apnoea. These results highlight the need for health-care professionals and providers to consider treatment for patients with mild obstructive sleep apnoea.

In December, 2019, reports emerged from Wuhan, China, of a severe acute respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). By the end of April, 2020, over 3 million people had been confirmed infected, with over 1 million in the USA alone, and over 215 000 deaths. The symptoms associated with COVID-19 are diverse, ranging from mild upper respiratory tract symptoms to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. The major risk factors for severe COVID-19 are shared with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), namely increasing age, male sex, and comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes. However, the role of antifibrotic therapy in patients with IPF who contract SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the scientific rationale for their continuation or cessation, is poorly defined. Furthermore, several licensed and potential antifibrotic compounds have been assessed in models of acute lung injury and viral pneumonia. Data from previous coronavirus infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, as well as emerging data from the COVID-19 pandemic, suggest there could be substantial fibrotic consequences following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Antifibrotic therapies that are available or in development could have value in preventing severe COVID-19 in patients with IPF, have the potential to treat severe COVID-19 in patients without IPF, and might have a role in preventing fibrosis after SARS-CoV-2 infection."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Accurate prediction of exacerbation risk enables personalised care for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We developed and validated a generalisable model to predict individualised rate and severity of COPD exacerbations.
Methods
In this risk modelling study, we pooled data from three COPD trials on patients with a history of exacerbations. We developed a mixed-effect model to predict exacerbations over 1 year. Severe exacerbations were those requiring inpatient care. Predictors were history of exacerbations, age, sex, body-mass index, smoking status, domiciliary oxygen therapy, lung function, symptom burden, and current medication use. Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate End-points (ECLIPSE), a multicentre cohort study, was used for external validation.
Results
The development dataset included 2380 patients, 1373 (58%) of whom were men. Mean age was 64·7 years (SD 8·8). Mean exacerbation rate was 1·42 events per year and 0·29 events per year were severe. When validated against all patients with COPD in ECLIPSE (mean exacerbation rate was 1·20 events per year, 0·27 events per year were severe), the area-under-curve (AUC) was 0·81 (95% CI 0·79–0·83) for at least two exacerbations and 0·77 (95% CI 0·74–0·80) for at least one severe exacerbation. Predicted exacerbation and observed exacerbation rates were similar (1·31 events per year for all exacerbations and 0·25 events per year for severe exacerbations vs 1·20 events per year and 0·27 events per year). In ECLIPSE, in patients with previous exacerbation history (mean exacerbation rate was 1·82 events per year, 0·40 events per year were severe), AUC was 0·73 (95% CI 0·70–0·76) for two or more exacerbations and 0·74 (95% CI 0·70–0·78) for at least one severe exacerbation. Calibration was accurate for severe exacerbations (predicted 0·37 events per year vs observed 0·40 events per year) and all exacerbations (predicted 1·80 events per year vs observed 1·82 events per year).
Interpretation
This model can be used as a decision tool to personalise COPD treatment and prevent exacerbations.

abstract = "Summary
The term interstitial lung abnormalities refers to specific CT findings that are potentially compatible with interstitial lung disease in patients without clinical suspicion of the disease. Interstitial lung abnormalities are increasingly recognised as a common feature on CT of the lung in older individuals, occurring in 4–9% of smokers and 2–7% of non-smokers. Identification of interstitial lung abnormalities will increase with implementation of lung cancer screening, along with increased use of CT for other diagnostic purposes. These abnormalities are associated with radiological progression, increased mortality, and the risk of complications from medical interventions, such as chemotherapy and surgery. Management requires distinguishing interstitial lung abnormalities that represent clinically significant interstitial lung disease from those that are subclinical. In particular, it is important to identify the subpleural fibrotic subtype, which is more likely to progress and to be associated with mortality. This multidisciplinary Position Paper by the Fleischner Society addresses important issues regarding interstitial lung abnormalities, including standardisation of the definition and terminology; predisposing risk factors; clinical outcomes; options for initial evaluation, monitoring, and management; the role of quantitative evaluation; and future research needs."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Donor lung use for transplantation is the lowest among solid organ tranplants because of several complex and multifactorial reasons; one area that could have a substantial role is the limited capabilities of cold ischaemic storage. The aim of the EXPAND trial was to evaluate the efficacy of normothermic portable Organ Care System (OCS) Lung perfusion and ventilation on donor lung use from extended-criteria donors and donors after circulatory death, which are rarely used.
Methods
In this single-arm, pivotal trial done in eight institutions across the USA, Germany, and Belgium, lungs from extended-criteria donors were included if fulfilling one or more of the following criteria: a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to fractional concentration of oxygen inspired air (FiO2) in the donor lung of 300 mm Hg or less; expected ischaemic time longer than 6 h; donor age 55 years or older; or lungs from donors after circulatory death that were recruited and assessed using OCS Lung. Lungs were transplanted if they showed stability of OCS Lung variables, PaO2:FiO2 was more than 300 mm Hg, and they were accepted by the transplanting surgeon. Patients were adult bilateral lung transplant recipients. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of patient survival at day 30 post-transplant and absence of The International Society for Heart & Lung Tranplantation primary-graft dysfunction grade 3 (PGD3) within 72 h post-transplantation, with a prespecified objective performance goal of 65%. The primary analysis population was all transplanted recipients. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01963780, and is now complete.
Findings
Between Jan 23, 2014, and Oct 23, 2016, 93 lung pairs were perfused, ventilated, and assessed on the OCS Lung. 12 lungs did not meet OCS transplantation criteria so 81 lungs were suitable for transplantation. Two lungs were excluded for logistical reasons, hence 79 (87%) of eligible lungs were transplanted. The primary endpoint was achieved in 43 (54%) of 79 patients and did not meet the objective performance goal. 35 (44%) of 79 patients had PGD3 within the initial 72 h. 78 (99%) of 79 patients had survived at 30 days post-transplant. The mean number of lung graft-related serious adverse events (respiratory failure and major pulmonary-related infection) was 0·3 events per patient (SD 0·5).
Interpretation
Despite missing the objective primary endpoint, the portable OCS Lung resulted in 87% donor lung use for transplantation with excellent clinical outcomes. Many lungs declined by other transplant centres were successfully transplanted using this new technology, which implies its use has the potential to increase the number of lung transplants performed worldwide. Whether similar outcomes could be obtained if these lungs were preserved on ice is unknown and remains an area for future research.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis requires long-term therapy with a combination of multiple second-line drugs. These drugs are associated with numerous adverse events that can cause severe morbidity, such as deafness, and in some instances can lead to death. Our aim was to estimate the absolute and relative frequency of adverse events associated with different tuberculosis drugs to provide useful information for clinicians and tuberculosis programmes in selecting optimal treatment regimens.
Methods
We did a meta-analysis using individual-level patient data that were obtained from studies that reported adverse events that resulted in permanent discontinuation of anti-tuberculosis medications. We used a database created for our previous meta-analysis of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment and outcomes, for which we did a systematic review of literature published between Jan 1, 2009, and Aug 31, 2015 (updated April 15, 2016), and requested individual patient-level information from authors. We also considered for this analysis studies contributing patient-level data in response to a public call made by WHO in 2018. Meta-analysis for proportions and arm-based network meta-analysis were done to estimate the incidence of adverse events for each tuberculosis drug.
Findings
58 studies were identified, including 50 studies from the updated individual patient data meta-analysis for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment. 35 of these studies, with 9178 patients, were included in our analysis. Using meta-analysis of proportions, drugs with low risks of adverse event occurrence leading to permanent discontinuation included levofloxacin (1·3% [95% CI 0·3–5·0]), moxifloxacin (2·9% [1·6–5·0]), bedaquiline (1·7% [0·7–4·2]), and clofazimine (1·6% [0·5–5·3]). Relatively high incidence of adverse events leading to permanent discontinuation was seen with three second-line injectable drugs (amikacin: 10·2% [6·3–16·0]; kanamycin: 7·5% [4·6–11·9]; capreomycin: 8·2% [6·3–10·7]), aminosalicylic acid (11·6% [7·1–18·3]), and linezolid (14·1% [9·9–19·6]). Risk of bias in selection of studies was judged to be low because there were no important differences between included and excluded studies. Variability between studies was significant for most outcomes analysed.
Interpretation
Fluoroquinolones, clofazimine, and bedaquiline had the lowest incidence of adverse events leading to permanent drug discontinuation, whereas second-line injectable drugs, aminosalicylic acid, and linezolid had the highest incidence. These results suggest that close monitoring of adverse events is important for patients being treated for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Our results also underscore the urgent need for safer and better-tolerated drugs to reduce morbidity from treatment itself for patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Former smokers now outnumber current smokers in many developed countries, and current smokers are smoking fewer cigarettes per day. Some data suggest that lung function decline normalises with smoking cessation; however, mechanistic studies suggest that lung function decline could continue. We hypothesised that former smokers and low-intensity current smokers have accelerated lung function decline compared with never-smokers, including among those without prevalent lung disease.
Methods
We used data on six US population-based cohorts included in the NHLBI Pooled Cohort Study. We restricted the sample to participants with valid spirometry at two or more exams. Two cohorts recruited younger adults (≥17 years), two recruited middle-aged and older adults (≥45 years), and two recruited only elderly adults (≥65 years) with examinations done between 1983 and 2014. FEV1 decline in sustained former smokers and current smokers was compared to that of never-smokers by use of mixed models adjusted for sociodemographic and anthropometric factors. Differential FEV1 decline was also evaluated according to duration of smoking cessation and cumulative (number of pack-years) and current (number of cigarettes per day) cigarette consumption.
Findings
25 352 participants (ages 17–93 years) completed 70 228 valid spirometry exams. Over a median follow-up of 7 years (IQR 3–20), FEV1 decline at the median age (57 years) was 31·01 mL per year (95% CI 30·66–31·37) in sustained never-smokers, 34·97 mL per year (34·36–35·57) in former smokers, and 39·92 mL per year (38·92–40·92) in current smokers. With adjustment, former smokers showed an accelerated FEV1 decline of 1·82 mL per year (95% CI 1·24–2·40) compared to never-smokers, which was approximately 20% of the effect estimate for current smokers (9·21 mL per year; 95% CI 8·35–10·08). Compared to never-smokers, accelerated FEV1 decline was observed in former smokers for decades after smoking cessation and in current smokers with low cumulative cigarette consumption (<10 pack-years). With respect to current cigarette consumption, the effect estimate for FEV1 decline in current smokers consuming less than five cigarettes per day (7·65 mL per year; 95% CI 6·21–9·09) was 68% of that in current smokers consuming 30 or more cigarettes per day (11·24 mL per year; 9·86–12·62), and around five times greater than in former smokers (1·57 mL per year; 1·00–2·14). Among participants without prevalent lung disease, associations were attenuated but were consistent with the main results.
Interpretation
Former smokers and low-intensity current smokers have accelerated lung function decline compared with never-smokers. These results suggest that all levels of smoking exposure are likely to be associated with lasting and progressive lung damage.

abstract = "Summary
Systemic sclerosis is an autoimmune connective tissue disease, which is characterised by immune dysregulation and progressive fibrosis that typically affects the skin, with variable internal organ involvement. It is a rare condition that affects mostly young and middle-aged women, resulting in disproportionate morbidity and mortality. Currently, interstitial lung disease is the most common cause of death among patients with systemic sclerosis, with a prevalence of up to 30% and a 10-year mortality of up to 40%. Interstitial lung disease is more common among African Americans and in people with the diffuse cutaneous form of systemic sclerosis or anti-topoisomerase 1 antibodies. Systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease most commonly presents with dyspnoea, cough, and a non-specific interstitial pneumonia pattern on CT scan, with a minority of cases fulfilling the criteria for usual interstitial pneumonia. The standard therapy has traditionally been combinations of immunosuppressants, particularly mycophenolate mofetil or cyclophosphamide. These immunosuppressants can be supplemented by targeted biological and antifibrotic therapies, whereas autologous haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation and lung transplantation are reserved for refractory cases."

Background
Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a secreted glycoprotein that has a central role in the process of fibrosis. This study was designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of pamrevlumab (FG-3019), a fully recombinant human monoclonal antibody against CTGF, in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The aim was to establish whether pamrevlumab could slow, stop, or reverse progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
Methods
The phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled PRAISE trial was done at 39 medical centres in seven countries (Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, India, New Zealand, South Africa, and the USA). Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and percentage of predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) of 55% or greater were enrolled and randomly assigned (1:1) by use of interactive responsive technology to intravenous infusion of pamrevlumab 30 mg/kg or placebo every 3 weeks over 48 weeks (16 infusions). The primary efficacy outcome was change from baseline in percentage of predicted FVC at week 48. Disease progression (defined as a decline from baseline in percentage of predicted FVC of ≥10%, or death) at week 48 was a key secondary efficacy outcome. All patients in the pamrevlumab group received at least one dose of the study drug and were analysed for safety. Two patients in the placebo group were excluded from the intention-to-treat population for the efficacy analyses because of enrolment error. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01890265.
Findings
Between Aug 17, 2013, and July 21, 2017, 103 patients were randomly assigned (50 to pamrevlumab and 53 to placebo). Pamrevlumab reduced the decline in percentage of predicted FVC by 60·3% at week 48 (mean change from baseline −2·9% with pamrevlumab vs −7·2% with placebo; between-group difference 4·3% [95% CI 0·4–8·3]; p=0·033). The proportion of patients with disease progression was lower in the pamrevlumab group than in the placebo group at week 48 (10·0% vs 31·4%; p=0·013). Pamrevlumab was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of placebo. Treatment-emergent serious adverse events were observed in 12 (24%) patients in the pamrevlumab group and eight (15%) in the placebo group, with three patients on pamrevlumab and seven on placebo discontinuing treatment. Of the three (6%) deaths in the pamrevlumab group and six (11%) in the placebo group, none was considered treatment related.
Interpretation
Pamrevlumab attenuated progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and was well tolerated. Now in phase 3 development, pamrevlumab shows promise as a novel, safe, and effective treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

Tuberculosis kills more people than any other pathogen and the need for a universally effective vaccine has never been greater. An effective vaccine will be a key tool in achieving the targets set by WHO in the End TB Strategy. Tuberculosis vaccine development is difficult and slow. Substantial progress has been made in research and development of tuberculosis vaccines in the past 20 years, and two clinical trial results from 2018 provide reason for optimism. However, many challenges to the successful licensure and deployment of an effective tuberculosis vaccine remain. The development of new tools for vaccine evaluation might facilitate these processes, and continued collaborative working and sustained funding will be essential."

Background
Transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (TBLC) is a novel technique for sampling lung tissue for interstitial lung disease diagnosis. The aim of this study was to establish the diagnostic accuracy of TBLC compared with surgical lung biopsy (SLB), in the context of increasing use of TBLC in clinical practice as a less invasive biopsy technique.
Methods
COLDICE was a prospective, multicentre, diagnostic accuracy study investigating diagnostic agreement between TBLC and SLB, across nine Australian tertiary hospitals. Patients with interstitial lung disease aged between 18 and 80 years were eligible for inclusion if they required histopathological evaluation to aid diagnosis, after detailed baseline evaluation. After screening at a centralised multidisciplinary discussion (MDD), patients with interstitial lung disease referred for lung biopsy underwent sequential TBLC and SLB under one anaesthetic. Each tissue sample was assigned a number between 1 and 130, allocated in a computer-generated random sequence. Encoded biopsy samples were then analysed by masked pathologists. At subsequent MDD, de-identified cases were discussed twice with either TBLC or SLB along with clinical and radiological data, in random non-consecutive order. Co-primary endpoints were agreement of histopathological features in TBLC and SLB for patterns of definite or probable usual interstitial pneumonia, indeterminate for usual interstitial pneumonia, and alternative diagnosis; and for agreement of consensus clinical diagnosis using TBLC and SLB at MDD. Concordance and κ values were calculated for each primary endpoint. This study is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12615000718549.
Findings
Between March 15, 2016, and April 15, 2019, we enrolled 65 patients (31 [48%] men, 34 [52%] women; mean age 66·1 years [SD 9·3]; forced vital capacity 83·7% [SD 14·2]; diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide 63·4% [SD 12·8]). TBLC (7·1 mm, SD 1·9) and SLB (46·5 mm, 14·9) samples were each taken from two separate ipsilateral lobes. Histopathological agreement between TBLC and SLB was 70·8% (weighted κ 0·70, 95% CI 0·55–0·86); diagnostic agreement at MDD was 76·9% (κ 0·62, 0·47–0·78). For TBLC with high or definite diagnostic confidence at MDD (39 [60%] of 65 cases), 37 (95%) were concordant with SLB diagnoses. In the 26 (40%) of 65 cases with low-confidence or unclassifiable TBLC diagnoses, SLB reclassified six (23%) to alternative high-confidence or definite MDD diagnoses. Mild-moderate airway bleeding occurred in 14 (22%) patients due to TBLC. The 90-day mortality was 2% (one of 65 patients), following acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
Interpretation
High levels of agreement between TBLC and SLB for both histopathological interpretation and MDD diagnoses were shown. The TBLC MDD diagnoses made with high confidence were particularly reliable, showing excellent concordance with SLB MDD diagnoses. These data support the clinical utility of TBLC in interstitial lung disease diagnostic algorithms. Further studies investigating the safety profile of TBLC are needed.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias are often complicated by pulmonary hypertension, increasing morbidity and mortality. There are no approved treatments for pulmonary hypertension associated with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (PH-IIP). We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of riociguat in patients with PH-IIP.
Methods
RISE-IIP was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study done at 65 pulmonary hypertension and interstitial lung disease centres in 19 countries to evaluate the efficacy and safety of riociguat in patients with PH-IIP. Eligible patients were adults (aged 18–80 years) diagnosed with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (as per American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society/Japanese Respiratory Society/Latin American Thoracic Association guidelines), forced vital capacity (FVC) of at least 45%, 6MWD of 150–450 m, WHO functional classes II–IV, precapillary pulmonary hypertension confirmed by right heart catheterisation, systolic blood pressure of at least 95 mm Hg, and no signs or symptoms of hypotension. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1) using an interactive voice and web response system to riociguat (0·5–2·5 mg three times daily) or placebo for 26 weeks (main study), after which they could enter an open-label extension in which all patients received riociguat. The primary endpoint was change in 6-min walking distance (6MWD) in the intention-to-treat population. Prespecified safety variables included adverse events and serious adverse events, laboratory parameters, and adverse events of special interest (haemoptysis and symptomatic hypotension), assessed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02138825.
Findings
Between June 4, 2014, and May 5, 2016, we enrolled 229 participants. After the exclusion of 82 participants, 147 were randomly allocated to treatment (73 to riociguat, 74 to placebo). The study was terminated early (median treatment duration 157 days [range 6–203]) at the request of the data monitoring committee owing to increased serious adverse events (main study: 27 [37%] of 73 participants in the riociguat group vs 17 [23%] of 74 in the placebo group) and mortality in patients receiving riociguat, and the absence of efficacy signals in the riociguat group. 11 patients died in the main study (eight in the riociguat group, three in the placebo group), and nine died in the extension phase (one in the riociguat group, eight in the former placebo group; all received riociguat). In the main study, the most common adverse events were peripheral oedema (16 [22%] of 73 in the riociguat group vs seven [9%] of 74 in the placebo group) and diarrhoea (11 [15%] vs seven [9%]). The most common serious adverse events were worsening of interstitial lung disease (main study: six [8%] of 73 in the riociguat group vs five [7%] of 74 in the placebo group) and pneumonia (four [5%] vs one [1%]). Riociguat did not improve 6MWD versus placebo at 26 weeks (least-squares mean difference 21 m; 95% CI −9 to 52).
Interpretation
In patients with PH-IIP, riociguat was associated with increased serious adverse events and mortality, and an unfavourable risk–benefit profile. Riociguat should not be used in patients with PH-IIP.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Small airway dysfunction is a common but neglected respiratory abnormality. Little is known about its prevalence, risk factors, and prognostic factors in China or anywhere else in the world. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of small airway dysfunction using spirometry before and after bronchodilation, both overall and in specific population subgroups; assess its association with a range of lifestyle and environmental factors (particularly smoking); and estimate the burden of small airway dysfunction in China.
Methods
From June, 2012, to May, 2015, the nationally representative China Pulmonary Health study invited 57 779 adults to participate using a multistage stratified sampling method from ten provinces (or equivalent), and 50 479 patients with valid lung function testing results were included in the analysis. We diagnosed small airway dysfunction on the basis of at least two of the following three indicators of lung function being less than 65% of predicted: maximal mid-expiratory flow, forced expiratory flow (FEF) 50%, and FEF 75%. Small airway dysfunction was further categorised into pre-small airway dysfunction (defined as having normal FEV1 and FEV1/forced vital capacity [FVC] ratio before bronchodilator inhalation), and post-small airway dysfunction (defined as having normal FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio both before and after bronchodilator inhalation). Logistic regression yielded adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for small airway dysfunction associated with smoking and other lifestyle and environmental factors. We further estimated the total number of cases of small airway dysfunction in China by applying present study findings to national census data.
Findings
Overall the prevalence of small airway dysfunction was 43·5% (95% CI 40·7–46·3), pre-small airway dysfunction was 25·5% (23·6–27·5), and post-small airway dysfunction was 11·3% (10·3–12·5). After multifactor regression analysis, the risk of small airway dysfunction was significantly associated with age, gender, urbanisation, education level, cigarette smoking, passive smoking, biomass use, exposure to high particulate matter with a diameter less than 2·5 μm (PM2·5) concentrations, history of chronic cough during childhood, history of childhood pneumonia or bronchitis, parental history of respiratory diseases, and increase of body-mass index (BMI) by 5 kg/m2. The ORs for small airway dysfunction and pre-small airway dysfunction were similar, whereas larger effect sizes were generally seen for post-small airway dysfunction than for either small airway dysfunction or pre-small airway dysfunction. For post-small airway dysfunction, cigarette smoking, exposure to PM2·5, and increase of BMI by 5 kg/m2 were significantly associated with increased risk, among preventable risk factors. There was also a dose-response association between cigarette smoking and post-small airway dysfunction among men, but not among women. We estimate that, in 2015, 426 (95% CI 411–468) million adults had small airway dysfunction, 253 (238–278) million had pre-small airway dysfunction, and 111 (104–126) million had post-small airway dysfunction in China.
Interpretation
In China, spirometry-defined small airway dysfunction is highly prevalent, with cigarette smoking being a major modifiable risk factor, along with PM2·5 exposure and increase of BMI by 5 kg/m2. Our findings emphasise the urgent need to develop and implement effective primary and secondary prevention strategies to reduce the burden of this condition in the general population.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Use of maintenance antibiotic therapy with the macrolide azithromycin is increasing in a number of chronic respiratory disorders including primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). However, evidence for its efficacy in PCD is lacking. We aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of azithromycin maintenance therapy for 6 months in patients with PCD.
Methods
The Better Experimental Screening and Treatment for Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (BESTCILIA) trial was a multicentre, double-blind, parallel group, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial done at 6 European PCD clinics (tertiary paediatric care centres and university hospitals in Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, and UK). Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of PCD, aged 7–50 years old, and predicted FEV1 greater than 40% were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), stratified by age and study site, via a web-based randomisation system to azithromycin 250 mg or 500 mg as tablets according to bodyweight (</≥ 40 kg) or identical placebo, three times a week for 6 months. The random allocation sequence was a permuted block randomisation, with a block size of four, generated by an external consultancy. Participants, investigators, and care providers were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was the number of respiratory exacerbations over 6 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered in the EU Clinical Trials Register, EudraCT number 2013-004664-58.
Findings
Between June 24, 2014, and Aug 23, 2016, 102 patients were screened, of whom 90 were randomly assigned to either azithromycin (n=49) or placebo (n=41). The study was ended without having included the planned number of participants due to recruitment difficulties. The mean number of respiratory exacerbations over 6 months was 0·75 (SD 1·12) in the azithromycin group compared with 1·62 (1·64) in the placebo group, and participants receiving azithromycin had significantly lower rate of exacerbations during the individual treatment periods (rate ratio 0·45 [95% CI 0·26–0·78]; p=0·004). Four serious adverse events were reported, occurring in one (2%) of 47 participants in the azithromycin group and in three (7%) of 41 participants in the placebo group. Loose stools or diarrhoea were more common in the azithromycin group than in the placebo group (11 [23%] vs two [5%]).
Interpretation
This first multinational randomised controlled trial on pharmacotherapy in PCD showed that azithromycin maintenance therapy for 6 months was well tolerated and halved the rate of respiratory exacerbations. Azithromycin maintenance therapy is an option for patients with PCD with frequent exacerbations potentially leading to reduced need for additional antibiotic treatments and preventing irreversible lung damage.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Early use of parenteral nutrition in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) negatively affects development of executive functions, externalising behaviour, and visual–motor integration 2 years later, compared with omitting parenteral nutrition until PICU day 8 (late parenteral nutrition). The molecular basis of this finding is uncertain. We aimed to test the hypothesis that DNA methylation changes occur during critical illness and that early parenteral nutrition (or a specific macronutrient component hereof) contributes to these changes, which could explain its negative effects on neurocognitive development.
Methods
This pre-planned secondary analysis of the multicentre PEPaNIC trial (2012–18) included all patients with a last PICU day blood sample (n=825, aged 0–17 years at PICU admission) who were randomly allocated (1:1) to early parenteral nutrition or late parenteral nutrition, as compared with 352 demographically matched healthy children. Investigators were masked to treatment allocation. We used the Infinium Human MethylationEPIC BeadChip to determine the genome-wide peripheral blood leukocyte DNA methylation of 865 859 CpG sites, yielding high-quality results for 403 patients allocated to early parenteral nutrition and for 411 patients allocated to late parenteral nutrition. Applying a false discovery rate of less than 0·05, DNA methylation of patients on the last PICU day was compared with that of healthy children, after excluding all CpG sites differentially methylated upon PICU admission, because these reflected pre-admission conditions and altered leukocyte composition. We used bootstrapped multivariable linear and non-linear regression analyses to assess the effect of early parenteral nutrition versus late parenteral nutrition on illness-induced alterations in DNA methylation and to what extent differentially methylated CpG sites explained impaired neurocognitive development 2 years later.
Findings
During PICU stay, 159 CpG sites were methylated differently in patients admitted to the PICU than in healthy children, with mean effect sizes of 2·6% (SD 2·5) up to 21·6% (p<0·02). These differentially methylated CpG sites occurred in genes involved in brain development, plasticity, and signalling; neuronal differentiation, migration, and growth; metabolism; transcriptional regulation; physical development and locomotion; and several neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases. Early parenteral nutrition and, in particular, the dose of amino acids, independently contributed to the differential methylation of 37 (23%) of these 159 CpG sites (p=0·0001 to 0·050), which could explain the adverse effect of early parenteral nutrition on neurocognitive development at 2-year follow-up (R2 0·61 [SD 0·01]).
Interpretation
Early parenteral nutrition during paediatric critical illness altered DNA methylation, which suggests a plausible molecular basis for its negative effect on long-term neurocognitive development. Early administration of amino acids, rather than of glucose or lipids, mostly explained the aberrant DNA methylation—a finding that requires further investigation.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a lung inflammatory process caused mainly by sepsis. Most previous studies that identified genetic risks for ARDS focused on candidates with biological relevance. We aimed to identify novel genetic variants associated with ARDS susceptibility and to provide complementary functional evidence of their effect in gene regulation.
Methods
We did a case-control genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 1935 European individuals, using patients with sepsis-associated ARDS as cases and patients with sepsis without ARDS as controls. The discovery stage included 672 patients admitted into a network of Spanish intensive care units between January, 2002, and January, 2017. The replication stage comprised 1345 individuals from two independent datasets from the MESSI cohort study (Sep 22, 2008–Nov 30, 2017; USA) and the VISEP (April 1, 2003–June 30, 2005) and MAXSEP (Oct 1, 2007–March 31, 2010) trials of the SepNet study (Germany). Results from discovery and replication stages were meta-analysed to identify association signals. We then used RNA sequencing data from lung biopsies, in-silico analyses, and luciferase reporter assays to assess the functionallity of associated variants.
Findings
We identified a novel genome-wide significant association with sepsis-associated ARDS susceptibility (rs9508032, odds ratio [OR] 0·61, 95% CI 0·41–0·91, p=5·18 × 10−8) located within the Fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT1) gene, which encodes vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR-1). The region containing the sentinel variant and its best proxies acted as a silencer for the FLT1 promoter, and alleles with protective effects in ARDS further reduced promoter activity (p=0·0047). A literature mining of all previously described ARDS genes validated the association of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA; OR 0·55, 95% CI 0·41–0·73; p=4·69 × 10−5).
Interpretation
A common variant within the FLT1 gene is associated with sepsis-associated ARDS. Our findings support a role for the vascular endothelial growth factor signalling pathway in ARDS pathogenesis and identify VEGFR-1 as a potential therapeutic target.

abstract = "Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a surge of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in intensive care units across the globe. As experience of managing patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS has grown, so too have efforts to classify patients according to respiratory system mechanics, with a view to optimising ventilatory management. Personalised lung-protective mechanical ventilation reduces mortality and has become the mainstay of treatment in ARDS. In this Viewpoint, we address ventilatory strategies in the context of recent discussions on phenotypic heterogeneity in patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS. Although early reports suggested that COVID-19-associated ARDS has distinctive features that set it apart from historical ARDS, emerging evidence indicates that the respiratory system mechanics of patients with ARDS, with or without COVID-19, are broadly similar. In the absence of evidence to support a shift away from the current paradigm of ventilatory management, we strongly recommend adherence to evidence-based management, informed by bedside physiology, as resources permit."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Gefapixant is a P2X3 receptor antagonist that has shown promise for the treatment of refractory and unexplained chronic cough. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of gefapixant compared with placebo after 12 weeks of treatment for refractory chronic cough or unexplained chronic cough.
Methods
We did a 12-week, phase 2b, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with refractory chronic cough or unexplained chronic cough aged 18–80 years who were recruited from 44 primarily outpatient pulmonologist or allergist sites in the UK and the USA. Eligible patients had refractory or unexplained chronic cough lasting 1 year or longer, no radiographic chest abnormality, and 40 mm or more on a 100-mm cough severity visual analogue scale at enrolment. Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or one of three doses (7·5 mg, 20 mg, or 50 mg) of oral gefapixant twice daily, every day, for 84 days; visits to investigative sites were on days 1, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84, and 85. The randomisation schedule was computer generated using a permuted block algorithm by Advance Research Associates (Santa Clara, CA, USA). Patients and all personnel involved in the conduct and interpretation of the study were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was placebo-adjusted change from baseline in awake cough frequency after 12 weeks, assessed in the full analysis set, which is a subset of the intention-to-treat population. Adverse events were monitored and safety was evaluated in all patients receiving one or more doses of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02612610.
Findings
Between Dec 21, 2015, and July 26, 2016, 253 patients were randomly assigned to placebo (n=63), gefapixant 7·5 mg (n=64), gefapixant 20 mg (n=63), or gefapixant 50 mg (n=63) twice daily. The mean age of patients was 60·2 (SD 9·9) years and 193 (76%) were women. At 12 weeks, patients' geometric mean awake cough frequency was 18·2 coughs per h (geometric SD 3·1) with placebo, and 14·5 coughs per h (3·7) with 7·5 mg, 12·0 coughs per h (4·2) with 20 mg, and 11·3 coughs per h (2·8) with 50 mg gefapixant. Estimated percentage change relative to placebo was −22·0% (−41·8 to 4·6; p=0·097) with 7·5 mg, −22·2% (−42·0 to 4·3; p=0·093) with 20 mg, and −37·0% (95% CI −53·3 to −14·9; p=0·0027) with 50 mg gefapixant. Dysgeusia was the most common adverse event, occurring in three (5%) patients given placebo, six (10%) given 7·5 mg gefapixant, 21 (33%) given 20 mg gefapixant, and 30 (48%) given 50 mg gefapixant.
Interpretation
Targeting purinergic receptor P2X3 with gefapixant at a dose of 50 mg twice daily significantly reduced cough frequency in patients with refractory chronic cough or unexplained chronic cough after 12 weeks of treatment compared with placebo. Further development of gefapixant is warranted for the treatment of chronic cough.

With no cure for malignant pleural effusion, efforts are focused on symptomatic management.

The development of the tunnelled indwelling pleural catheter and ambulatory pleural drainage changed the management of malignant pleural effusion, not solely by offering an alternative management pathway, but by challenging how health-care providers view success in a palliative condition. Furthermore, with additional treatment options available, increased imperative exists to better characterise patients to enable a personalised approach to their care.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonists (LABA) are considered safe and efficacious in asthma management. Most available FDCs require twice-daily dosing to achieve optimum therapeutic effect. The objective of the PALLADIUM study was to assess the efficacy and safety of once-daily FDC of mometasone furoate plus indacaterol acetate (MF–IND) versus mometasone furoate (MF) monotherapy in patients with inadequately controlled asthma.
Methods
This 52-week, double-blind, triple-dummy, parallel-group, phase 3 study recruited patients from 316 centres across 24 countries. Patients aged 12 to 75 years with a documented diagnosis of asthma for at least 1 year, percentage of predicted FEV1 of 50–85%, and an Asthma Control Questionnaire 7 score of at least 1·5 despite treatment with medium-dose or high-dose ICS or low-dose ICS plus LABA were included. A history of asthma exacerbations was not a study requirement. Participants were randomily assigned (1:1:1:1:1) via interactive response technology to receive one of the following treatments for 52 weeks: high-dose MF–IND (320 μg, 150 μg) or medium-dose MF–IND (160 μg, 150 μg) once daily via Breezhaler; high-dose MF (800 μg [400 μg twice daily]) or medium-dose MF (400 μg once daily) via Twisthaler; or high-dose fluticasone propionate–salmeterol xinafoate (FLU–SAL; 500 μg, 50 μg) twice daily via Diskus. Participants received placebo via inhalation through the Breezhaler, Twisthaler, or Diskus devices in the mornings and evenings, as appropriate. The primary endpoint was improvement in trough FEV1 with high-dose and medium-dose MF–IND versus respective MF doses from baseline at 26 weeks, analysed in the full analysis set by means of a mixed model for repeated measures. High-dose MF–IND once daily was compared with high-dose FLU–SAL twice daily for non-inferiority on improving trough FEV1 at week 26 with a margin of −90 mL using mixed model for repeated measures as one of the secondary endpoints. Safety was assessed in all patients who had received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02554786, and is completed.
Findings
Between Dec 29, 2015, and May 4, 2018, 2216 patients were randomly assigned (high-dose MF–IND, n=445; medium-dose MF–IND, n=439; high-dose MF, n=442; medium-dose MF, n=444; high-dose FLU–SAL, n=446), of which 1973 (89·0%) completed the study treatment and 234 (10·6%) prematurely discontinued study treatment. High-dose MF–IND (treatment difference [Δ] 132 mL [95% CI 88 to 176]; p<0·001) and medium-dose MF–IND (Δ 211 mL [167 to 255]; p<0·001) showed superiority in improving trough FEV1 over corresponding MF doses from baseline at week 26. High-dose MF–IND was non-inferior to high-dose FLU–SAL in improving trough FEV1 from baseline at week 26 (Δ 36 mL [−7 to 80]; p=0·101). Overall, the incidence of adverse events was similar across the treatment groups.
Interpretation
Once-daily FDC of ICS and LABA (MF−IND) significantly improved lung function over ICS monotherapy (MF) at week 26; high-dose MF–IND was non-inferior to twice-daily combination of ICS and LABA (high-dose FLU–SAL) for improvement in trough FEV1. The combination of MF–IND provides a novel once-daily dry powder option for asthma control.

abstract = "Summary
Background
We evaluated the efficacy and safety of tepotinib, a potent and highly selective oral MET inhibitor, plus gefitinib in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with MET overexpression (immunohistochemistry [IHC]2+ or IHC3+) or MET amplification having acquired resistance to EGFR inhibition.
Methods
In this open-label, phase 1b/2, multicentre, randomised trial (the INSIGHT study), we enrolled adult patients (≥18 years) with advanced or metastatic NSCLC, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, from academic medical centres and community clinics in six Asian countries. In phase 1b, patients received oral tepotinib 300 mg or 500 mg plus gefitinib 250 mg once daily. In phase 2, patients with EGFR-mutant, T790M-negative NSCLC MET overexpression or MET amplification were randomly assigned (initially in a 1:1 ratio and then 2:1 following a protocol amendment) to tepotinib plus gefitinib at the recommended phase 2 dose or to standard platinum doublet chemotherapy. Randomisation was done centrally via an interactive voice-response system. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and safety. Subgroup analyses were preplanned in patients with high MET overexpression (IHC3+) or MET amplification (mean gene copy number ≥5 or MET to centromere of chromosome 7 ratio ≥2). Efficacy and patient characteristics were assessed on an intention-to-treat basis and safety was assessed for all patients who received at least one dose of study medication. Low recruitment led to early termination of phase 2, so all analyses are considered to be exploratory. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01982955, and the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials Database, Eudra-CT 2016-001604-28.
Findings
From Dec 23, 2013, to May 25, 2017, 18 patients were enrolled in phase 1b (n=6 in the 300 mg tepotinib group; n=12 in the 500 mg tepotinib group) and 55 patients in phase 2 (n=31 in the tepotinib plus gefitinib group; n=24 in the chemotherapy group). No dose-limiting toxicities were observed in phase 1b, so tepotinib 500 mg was used as the recommended phase 2 dose. In phase 2, survival outcomes were similar between groups: median PFS was 4·9 months in the tepotinib plus gefitinib group (90% CI 3·9–6·9) versus 4·4 months in the chemotherapy group (90% CI 4·2–6·8; hazard ratio [HR] 0·67, 90% CI 0·35–1·28). Median OS was 17·3 months in the tepotinib plus gefitinib group (12·1–37·3) versus 18·7 months in the chemotherapy group (15·9–20·7; HR 0·69, 0·34–1·41). PFS and OS were longer with tepotinib plus gefitinib than with chemotherapy in patients with high (IHC3+) MET overexpression (n=34; median PFS 8·3 months [4·1–16·6] vs 4·4 months [4·1–6·8]; HR 0·35, 0·17–0·74; median OS 37·3 months [90% CI 24·2–37·3] vs 17·9 months [12·0–20·7]; HR 0·33, 0·14–0·76) or MET amplification (n=19; median PFS 16·6 months [8·3–not estimable] vs 4·2 months [1·4–7·0]; HR 0·13, 0·04–0·43; median OS 37·3 months [90% CI not estimable] vs 13·1 months [3·25–not estimable]; HR 0·08, 0·01–0·51). The most frequent treatment-related grade 3 or worse adverse events were increased amylase (5 [16%] of 31 patients) and lipase (4 [13%]) concentrations in the tepotinib plus gefitinib group and anaemia (7 [30%] of 23 patients) and decreased neutrophil count (3 [13%]) in the chemotherapy group.
Interpretation
Despite early study termination, in a preplanned subgroup analysis, our findings suggest improved anti activity for tepotinib plus gefitinib compared with standard chemotherapy in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC and MET amplification, warranting further exploration.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Therapeutic blockade of the axis of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) has transformed the management of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Clinical trials with pembrolizumab have enrolled patients with performance status (PS) 0–1. However, around 18% of patients with NSCLC are PS2, and the activity and safety of pembrolizumab in these patients is unclear. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab in these patients.
Methods
We did a multicentre, single-arm, open-label, phase 2 trial (PePS2) in ten hospitals in the UK, in which patients with NSCLC and a rigorous ascription of PS2 were given pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks. No masking was used in this trial. We stratified the treatment evaluation by tumour proportion score (TPS) and line of therapy. Co-primary outcomes were: (1) durable clinical benefit (DCB), defined as the occurrence of complete response, partial response, or stable disease that continues until at least the second CT scan scheduled at 18 weeks; and (2) toxicity, defined as the occurrence at any time of treatment-related dose delay or treatment discontinuation due to an adverse event. Analysis included all patients who received any pembrolizumab. As well as reporting simple observed incidence for the co-primary outcomes, DCB and toxicity, we also estimated incidence using a model-based method for correlated binary outcomes. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02733159; EudraCT, 2015-002241-55; and ISRCTN, 10047797.
Findings
Between Jan 4, 2017, and Feb 13, 2018, of 112 patients assessed for eligibility, we recruited 62 patients. 60 patients were evaluable for the co-primary outcomes. Median age was 72 years (IQR 65–75); 33 (55%) of participants were male and 27 (45%) were female. The observed incidence for DCB was 38% (95% CI 21–57) in first-line patients (n=24) and 36% (22–52) in subsequent-line patients (n=36); DCB was 22% (11–41) in patients with a TPS less than 1% (n=27), 47% (25–70) in patients with a TPS of 1–49% (n=15), and 53% (30–75) in patients with a TPS of 50% or greater (n=15). An increase in DCB incidences with TPS was also shown in model-based estimates. Toxicity was observed in 28% (95% CI 19–41) of patients, 11 (18%) of 60 due to dose delay and 6 (10%) of 60 due to drug discontinuation. No grade 5 treatment-related adverse events were observed and no early deaths were attributed to hyperprogression. The most common grade 3–4 adverse events were dyspnoea (n=9), hyponatraemia (n=5), and anorexia (n=4). There were ten serious adverse events considered to be related to treatment, comprising diarrhoea (n=3) and acute kidney injury, adrenal insufficiency, hyperbilirubinaemia, oral mucositis, rash, urinary tract infection, and vomiting (n=1 each).
Interpretation
Patients with NSCLC of PS2 are a group of patients of unmet therapeutic need. The PePS2 trial shows that pembrolizumab can be safely administered to these patients, with no increase in the risk of immune-related or other toxicities. Efficacy outcomes are at least as good as those in patients with PS0–1 and the data provides clinicians with the confidence to incorporate pembrolizumab into the treatment pathway of patients with NSCLC of PS2.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Bronchiectasis guidelines recommend antibiotics for the treatment of acute respiratory exacerbations, but randomised placebo-controlled trials in children are lacking. We hypothesised that oral amoxicillin–clavulanate and azithromycin would each be superior to placebo in achieving symptom resolution of non-severe exacerbations in children by day 14 of treatment.
Methods
In this multicentre, three-arm, parallel, double-dummy, double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial at four paediatric centres in Australia and New Zealand, we enrolled children aged 1–18 years with CT-confirmed bronchiectasis unrelated to cystic fibrosis, who were under the care of a respiratory physician and who had had at least two respiratory exacerbations in the 18 months before study entry. Participants were allocated (1:1:1) at exacerbation onset to receive oral suspensions of amoxicillin–clavulanate (45 mg/kg per day) plus placebo azithromycin, azithromycin (5 mg/kg per day) plus placebo amoxicillin–clavulanate, or both placebos for 14 days. An independent statistician prepared a computer-generated, permuted-block (size 2–8) randomisation sequence, stratified by centre, age, and cause. Participants, caregivers, study coordinators, and investigators were masked to treatment assignment until data analysis was completed. The primary outcome was the proportion of children with exacerbation resolution by day 14 in the intention-to-treat population. Treatment groups were compared using generalised linear models. Statistical significance was set at p<0·0245 to account for multiple comparisons. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12612000011886) and is completed.
Findings
Between April 17, 2012, and March 1, 2017, 604 children were screened and 252 were enrolled. Between July 31, 2012, and June 26, 2017, 197 children were allocated at the start of an exacerbation (63 to the amoxicillin–clavulanate group, 67 to the azithromycin group, and 67 to the placebo group). Respiratory viruses were identified in 82 (53%) of 154 children with available nasal swabs on day 1 of treatment. Primary outcome data were available for 196 (99%) children (one child with missing data [placebo group] was recorded as non-resolved according to criteria defined a priori). By day 14, exacerbations had resolved in 41 (65%) children in the amoxicillin–clavulanate group, 41 (61%) in the azithromycin group, and 29 (43%) in the placebo group. Compared with placebo, relative risk for resolution by day 14 was 1·50 (95% CI 1·08–2·09, p=0·015; number-needed-to-treat [NNT] 5 [95% CI 3–20]) in the amoxicillin–clavulanate group and 1·41 (1·01–1·97, p=0·042; NNT 6 [3–79]) in the azithromycin group. Adverse events were recorded in 19 (30%) children in the amoxicillin–clavulanate group, 20 (30%) in the azithromycin group, and 14 (21%) in the placebo group, but no events were severe or life-threatening.
Interpretation
Amoxicillin–clavulanate treatment is beneficial in terms of resolution of non-severe exacerbations of bronchiectasis in children, and should remain the first-line oral antibiotic in this setting.

Background
The observation that patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) can have higher than normal expiratory flow rates at low lung volumes led to the conclusion that the airways are spared in IPF. This study aimed to re-examine the hypothesis that airways are spared in IPF using a multiresolution imaging protocol that combines multidetector CT (MDCT), with micro-CT and histology.
Methods
This was a retrospective cohort study comparing explanted lungs from patients with severe IPF treated by lung transplantation with a cohort of unused donor (control) lungs. The donor control lungs had no known lung disease, comorbidities, or structural lung injury, and were deemed appropriate for transplantation on review of the clinical files. The diagnosis of IPF in the lungs from patients was established by a multidisciplinary consensus committee according to existing guidelines, and was confirmed by video-assisted thoracic surgical biopsy or by pathological examination of the contralateral lung. The control and IPF groups were matched for age, sex, height, and bodyweight. Samples of lung tissue were compared using the multiresolution imaging approach: a cascade of clinical MDCT, micro-CT, and histological imaging. We did two experiments: in experiment 1, all the lungs were randomly sampled; in experiment 2, samples were selected from regions of minimal and established fibrosis. The patients and donors were recruited from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (Leuven, Belgium) and the University of Pennsylvania Hospital (Philadelphia, PA, USA). The study took place at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, and the University of British Columbia (Vancouver, BC, Canada).
Findings
Between Oct 5, 2009, and July 22, 2016, explanted lungs from patients with severe IPF (n=11), were compared with a cohort of unused donor (control) lungs (n=10), providing 240 samples of lung tissue for comparison using the multiresolution imaging approach. The MDCT specimen scans show that the number of visible airways located between the ninth generation (control 69 [SD 22] versus patients with IPF 105 [33], p=0·0023) and 14th generation (control 9 [6] versus patients with IPF 49 [28], p<0·0001) of airway branching are increased in patients with IPF, which we show by micro-CT is due to thickening of their walls and distortion of their lumens. The micro-CT analysis showed that compared with healthy (control) lung anatomy (mean 5·6 terminal bronchioles per mL [SD 1·6]), minimal fibrosis in IPF tissue was associated with a 57% loss of the terminal bronchioles (mean 2·4 terminal bronchioles per mL [SD 1·0]; p<0·0001), the appearance of fibroblastic foci, and infiltration of the tissue by inflammatory immune cells capable of forming lymphoid follicles. Established fibrosis in IPF tissue had a similar reduction (66%) in the number of terminal bronchioles (mean 1·9 terminal bronchioles per mL [SD 1·4]; p<0·0001) and was dominated by increased airspace size, Ashcroft fibrosis score, and volume fractions of tissue and collagen.
Interpretation
Small airways disease is a feature of IPF, with significant loss of terminal bronchioles occuring within regions of minimal fibrosis. On the basis of these findings, we postulate that the small airways could become a potential therapeutic target in IPF.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Using latent class analysis (LCA) in five randomised controlled trial (RCT) cohorts, two distinct phenotypes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have been identified: hypoinflammatory and hyperinflammatory. The phenotypes are associated with differential outcomes and treatment response. The objective of this study was to develop parsimonious models for phenotype identification that could be accurate and feasible to use in the clinical setting.
Methods
In this retrospective study, three RCT cohorts from the National Lung, Heart, and Blood Institute ARDS Network (ARMA, ALVEOLI, and FACTT) were used as the derivation dataset (n=2022), from which the machine learning and logistic regression classifer models were derived, and a fourth (SAILS; n=715) from the same network was used as the validation test set. LCA-derived phenotypes in all of these cohorts served as the reference standard. Machine-learning algorithms (random forest, bootstrapped aggregating, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) were used to select a maximum of six important classifier variables, which were then used to develop nested logistic regression models. Only cases with complete biomarker data in the derivation dataset were used for variable selection. The best logistic regression models based on parsimony and predictive accuracy were then evaluated in the validation test set. Finally, the models' prognostic validity was tested in two external ARDS clinical trial datasets (START and HARP-2) by assessing mortality at days 28, 60, and 90 and ventilator-free days to day 28.
Findings
The six most important classifier variables were interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, protein C, soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor 1, bicarbonate, and vasopressor use. From the nested models, three-variable (IL-8, bicarbonate, and protein C) and four-variable (3-variable plus vasopressor use) models were adjudicated to be the best performing. In the validation test set, both models showed good accuracy (AUC 0·94 [95% CI 0·92–0·95] for the three-variable model and 0·95 [95% CI 0·93–0·96] for the four-variable model) against LCA classifications. As with LCA-derived phenotypes, the hyperinflammatory phenotype as identified by the classifier model was associated with higher mortality at day 90 (87 [39%] of 223 patients vs 112 [23%] of 492 patients; p<0·0001) and fewer ventilator-free days (median 14 days [IQR 0–22] vs 22 days [0–25]; p<0·0001). In the external validation datasets, three-variable models developed in the derivation dataset identified two phenotypes with distinct clinical features and outcomes consistent with previous findings, including differential survival with simvastatin versus placebo in HARP-2 (p=0·023 for survival at 28 days).
Interpretation
ARDS phenotypes can be accurately identified with parsimonious classifier models using three or four variables. Pending the development of real-time testing for key biomarkers and prospective validation, these models could facilitate identification of ARDS phenotypes to enable their application in clinical trials and practice.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Ensartinib is a potent new-generation ALK inhibitor with high activity against a broad range of known crizotinib-resistant ALK mutations and CNS metastases. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of ensartinib in ALK-positive patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), in whom crizotinib therapy was unsuccessful. The associations between ensartinib efficacy and crizotinib-resistant mutations were also explored.
Methods
We did a single-arm, open-label, phase 2 study at 27 centres in China. Patients were aged 18 years or older, had stage IIIb or stage IV ALK-positive NSCLC that had progressed while they were on crizotinib therapy, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less, had measurable disease, and had received fewer than three previous treatments. Patients with CNS metastases were included if these metastases were asymptomatic and did not require steroid therapy. All patients received 225 mg ensartinib orally once daily on a continuous dosing schedule. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with an objective response according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (version 1.1), as assessed by an independent review committee in all patients who received at least one dose of ensartinib with no major violations of the inclusion criteria (ie, the full analysis set). Safety was assessed in all enrolled patients who received at least one dose of ensartinib. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03215693.
Findings
Between Sept 28, 2017, and April 11, 2018, 160 patients were enrolled and had at least one dose of ensartinib (safety analysis set). Four patients had inclusion violations and were excluded from the efficacy analysis, which thus included 156 patients (full analysis set). 97 (62%) patients in the full analysis set had brain metastases. 76 (52% [95% CI 43–60]) of 147 patients in the full analysis set, with responses that could be assessed by the independent review committee, had an objective response. 28 (70% [53–83]) of 40 patients with measurable brain metastases as assessed by the independent review committee had an intracranial objective response. 145 (91%) of 160 patients had at least one treatment-related adverse event, which were mostly grade 1 or 2. The most common treatment-related adverse events were rash (89 [56%]), increased alanine aminotransferase concentrations (74 [46%]), and increased aspartate aminotransferase concentrations (65 [41%]).
Interpretation
Ensartinib has activity and is well tolerated in patients with crizotinib-refractory, ALK-positive NSCLC, including those with brain metastases. The role of ensartinib in patients in whom other second-generation ALK inhibitors have been unsuccessful warrants further studies.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection during infancy is suggested to cause long-term wheeze. In turn, wheeze has been associated with bacterial dysbiosis of the respiratory tract. We investigated the effects of RSV prophylaxis with palivizumab in otherwise healthy preterm infants on respiratory microbiota composition at 1 year and 6 years of age.
Methods
In a multicentre, single-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial (the MAKI trial), infants born between 32–35 weeks of gestation, in one university and in 15 regional hospitals in the the Netherlands, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive palivizumab or placebo during the RSV season of their first year of life. Intramuscular injections of palivizumab 15 mg/kg or placebo were given during one RSV season: either from Oct 1, or from discharge from the neonatal unit until March 10 (minimun of 2 and maximum of 5 injections were given). Children were 6 months old or younger at the start of the RSV season; exclusion criteria included congenital heart disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, Down's syndrome, or other serious congenital disorders, use of mechanical ventilation at birth, treatment with surfactant, or physician-diagnosed wheeze before the start of the RSV season. Children were followed up for clinical symptoms until 6 years of age. For this subanalysis, we obtained nasopharyngeal swabs from children aged 1 year and 6 years and analysed them using 16S-rRNA sequencing. At 6 years we also measured reversible airway obstruction. The primary outcome was the effect of palivizumab during infancy on the respiratory microbiota composition at age 1 year and 6 years (intention-to-treat analysis). The trial is registered in the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN73641710.
Findings
From April 1, 2008, to Dec 31, 2010, 429 infants were enrolled in the MAKI trial (n=214 to the palivizumab group; n=215 to the placebo group). At 1 year, we collected swabs and sequenced DNA from 170 (40%) of 429 children, of which 145 (85%) samples had high-quality DNA. The overall microbiota composition was significantly different (R2 1·3%; p=0·0185) between the palivizumab group and the placebo group at 1 year of life; children in the palivizumab group had a significantly lower abundance of the Staphylococcus-dominated cluster (odds ratio 0·28 [95% CI 0·11–0·68]; p=0·00394), an increased abundance of biomarker species, such as Klebsiella, and a more diverse set of oral taxa, including Streptococcus spp, compared with children in the placebo group. At 6 years, we collected swabs and sequenced DNA from 349 (88%) of 395 children who completed follow-up, of which 342 (98%) samples had high-quality DNA. The overall microbiota composition was not significantly different between groups at 6 years (R2 0·6%; p=0·0575); however, children in the palivizumab group had a significantly increased abundance of Haemophilus spp and lower abundance of Moraxella and Neisseriaceae spp compared with children in the placebo group. Absence of PCR-confirmed RSV infection at 1 year was significantly associated with a higher abundance of Haemophilus spp at age 6 years and a significantly lower abundance of Moraxella and Neisseriaceae than children with RSV infection at 1 year. Reversible airway obstruction at 6 years was also positively associated with Haemophilus abundance and negatively associated with the abundance of health-associated taxa, such as Moraxella, Corynebacterium, Dolosigranulum, and Staphylococcus, even after correction for RSV immunoprophylaxis (all: p<0·05). Additionally, reversible airway instruction was associated with significantly higher Streptococcus pneumoniae abundance.
Interpretation
Palivizumab in infancy in otherwise healthy preterm infants is associated with persistent effects on the abundance of specific, potentially pathogenic, microbial taxa in the respiratory tract. Several of the palivizumab-associated biomarker species were associated with reversible airway obstruction at age 6 years. These results warrant further studies to establish the long-term ecological effects and health consequences of palivizumab in infancy.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Genetic factors influence chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) risk, but the individual variants that have been identified have small effects. We hypothesised that a polygenic risk score using additional variants would predict COPD and associated phenotypes.
Methods
We constructed a polygenic risk score using a genome-wide association study of lung function (FEV1 and FEV1/forced vital capacity [FVC]) from the UK Biobank and SpiroMeta. We tested this polygenic risk score in nine cohorts of multiple ethnicities for an association with moderate-to-severe COPD (defined as FEV1/FVC <0·7 and FEV1 <80% of predicted). Associations were tested using logistic regression models, adjusting for age, sex, height, smoking pack-years, and principal components of genetic ancestry. We assessed predictive performance of models by area under the curve. In a subset of studies, we also studied quantitative and qualitative CT imaging phenotypes that reflect parenchymal and airway pathology, and patterns of reduced lung growth.
Findings
The polygenic risk score was associated with COPD in European (odds ratio [OR] per SD 1·81 [95% CI 1·74–1·88] and non-European (1·42 [1·34–1·51]) populations. Compared with the first decile, the tenth decile of the polygenic risk score was associated with COPD, with an OR of 7·99 (6·56–9·72) in European ancestry and 4·83 (3·45–6·77) in non-European ancestry cohorts. The polygenic risk score was superior to previously described genetic risk scores and, when combined with clinical risk factors (ie, age, sex, and smoking pack-years), showed improved prediction for COPD compared with a model comprising clinical risk factors alone (AUC 0·80 [0·79–0·81] vs 0·76 [0·75–0·76]). The polygenic risk score was associated with CT imaging phenotypes, including wall area percent, quantitative and qualitative measures of emphysema, local histogram emphysema patterns, and destructive emphysema subtypes. The polygenic risk score was associated with a reduced lung growth pattern.
Interpretation
A risk score comprised of genetic variants can identify a small subset of individuals at markedly increased risk for moderate-to-severe COPD, emphysema subtypes associated with cigarette smoking, and patterns of reduced lung growth.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Since June, 2019, more than 1000 new cases of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (EVALI) have been reported in the USA. Patients presented with dyspnoea, cough, and were found to be hypoxaemic with bilateral airspace opacities on chest imaging. Most patients required management in the intensive care unit and steroid therapy. All patients recovered with cessation of vaping, supportive care, and steroid therapy and remained symptom free at follow up. E-cigarette use continues to rapidly escalate in the USA, particularly among youth.
Methods
Cases were defined as patients admitted to the University of Rochester Medical Center (Rochester, NY, USA) who had used e-cigarettes or another vaping device in the 30 days before presentation, and who had bilateral airspace opacification on chest imaging (CT or x-ray). Case details were obtained via medical record review and patient interviews over the past 3 months including symptomatology, physical exam data, imaging studies, laboratory data, vaping history, and subsequent outpatient follow-up data. In collaboration with the New York State Department of Health, our hospital developed a novel clinical practice algorithm based on statewide physician feedback along with input from experts in environmental health, medical toxicology, infectious disease, epidemiology, and chronic disease prevention.
Findings
We report 12 cases treated for suspected EVALI at our medical centre between June 6, 2019, and Sept 15, 2019. Ten (83%) patients had dyspnoea, fever, and emesis and nine (75%) had cough. 11 (92%) patients reported the use of e-cigarette cartridges containing tetrahydrocannabinol oil. Although eight (67%) patients required admission to the intensive care unit for hypoxaemic respiratory failure, no deaths occurred. The median hospitalisation duration was 7 days (IQR 7–8). All patients completing follow up (6 [50%]) had resolution of previous chest CT findings and normal spirometry. The clinical algorithm focuses on the key signs and symptoms of EVALI and the importance of ruling out infection and other cardiopulmonary conditions before making a presumptive diagnosis of EVALI.
Interpretation
Patients with suspected EVALI in our cohort had life-threatening hypoxaemia, with 67% requiring management in the intensive care unit. Despite the severity of presentation, similar to previous reports of patients with EVALI, most patients improved within 1–2 weeks of initial presentation after vaping cessation and administration of systemic corticosteroids when needed. Almost all (92%) patients with suspected EVALI reported vaping a THC product, making THC containing e-liquids or oils a key focus on the ongoing nationwide investigations into the cause of EVALI. Additional research is required to understand the potential toxins, underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, and identification of susceptible individuals at higher risk for hospitalisation due to EVALI. To our knowledge we present the first clinical practice algorithm for the evaluation and management of EVALI, which will be useful for both acute management and improved accurate reporting of this life-threatening respiratory illness.

Background
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019, causing a respiratory disease (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) of varying severity in Wuhan, China, and subsequently leading to a pandemic. The transmissibility and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 remain poorly understood. We evaluate its tissue and cellular tropism in human respiratory tract, conjunctiva, and innate immune responses in comparison with other coronavirus and influenza virus to provide insights into COVID-19 pathogenesis.
Methods
We isolated SARS-CoV-2 from a patient with confirmed COVID-19, and compared virus tropism and replication competence with SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1 (H1N1pdm) in ex-vivo cultures of human bronchus (n=5) and lung (n=4). We assessed extrapulmonary infection using ex-vivo cultures of human conjunctiva (n=3) and in-vitro cultures of human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines. Innate immune responses and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression were investigated in human alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages. In-vitro studies included the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus (H5N1) and mock-infected cells as controls.
Findings
SARS-CoV-2 infected ciliated, mucus-secreting, and club cells of bronchial epithelium, type 1 pneumocytes in the lung, and the conjunctival mucosa. In the bronchus, SARS-CoV-2 replication competence was similar to MERS-CoV, and higher than SARS-CoV, but lower than H1N1pdm. In the lung, SARS-CoV-2 replication was similar to SARS-CoV and H1N1pdm, but was lower than MERS-CoV. In conjunctiva, SARS-CoV-2 replication was greater than SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 was a less potent inducer of proinflammatory cytokines than H5N1, H1N1pdm, or MERS-CoV.
Interpretation
The conjunctival epithelium and conducting airways appear to be potential portals of infection for SARS-CoV-2. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replicated similarly in the alveolar epithelium; SARS-CoV-2 replicated more extensively in the bronchus than SARS-CoV. These findings provide important insights into the transmissibility and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and differences with other respiratory pathogens.

Primary ciliary dyskinesia is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous syndrome. Impaired function of motile cilia causes failure of mucociliary clearance. Patients typically present with neonatal respiratory distress of unknown cause and then continue to have a daily wet cough, recurrent chest infections, perennial rhinosinusitis, otitis media with effusion, and bronchiectasis. Approximately 50% of patients have situs inversus, and infertility is common. While understanding of the underlying genetics and disease mechanisms have substantially advanced in recent years, there remains a paucity of evidence for treatment. Next-generation sequencing has increased gene discovery, and mutations in more than 40 genes have been reported to cause primary ciliary dyskinesia, with many other genes likely to be discovered. Increased knowledge of cilia genes is challenging perceptions of the clinical phenotype, as some genes reported in the last 5 years are associated with mild respiratory disease. Developments in genomics and molecular medicine are rapidly improving diagnosis, and a genetic cause can be identified in approximately 70% of patients known to have primary ciliary dyskinesia. Groups are now investigating novel and personalised treatments, although gene therapies are unlikely to be available in the near future."

abstract = "Summary
Pneumonia is a leading killer of children younger than 5 years despite high vaccination coverage, improved nutrition, and widespread implementation of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses algorithm. Assessing the effect of interventions on childhood pneumonia is challenging because the choice of case definition and surveillance approach can affect the identification of pneumonia substantially. In anticipation of an intervention trial aimed to reduce childhood pneumonia by lowering household air pollution, we created a working group to provide recommendations regarding study design and implementation. We suggest to, first, select a standard case definition that combines acute (≤14 days) respiratory symptoms and signs and general danger signs with ancillary tests (such as chest imaging and pulse oximetry) to improve pneumonia identification; second, to prioritise active hospital-based pneumonia surveillance over passive case finding or home-based surveillance to reduce the risk of non-differential misclassification of pneumonia and, as a result, a reduced effect size in a randomised trial; and, lastly, to consider longitudinal follow-up of children younger than 1 year, as this age group has the highest incidence of severe pneumonia."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Health-care workers constitute a high-risk population for acquisition of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Capacity for acute diagnosis via PCR testing was limited for individuals with mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and a substantial proportion of health-care workers with suspected infection were not tested. We aimed to investigate the performance of point-of-care and laboratory serology assays and their utility in late case identification, and to estimate SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence.
Methods
We did a prospective multicentre cohort study between April 8 and June 12, 2020, in two phases. Symptomatic health-care workers with mild to moderate symptoms were eligible to participate 14 days after onset of COVID-19 symptoms, as per the Public Health England (PHE) case definition. Health-care workers were recruited to the asymptomatic cohort if they had not developed PHE-defined COVID-19 symptoms since Dec 1, 2019. In phase 1, two point-of-care lateral flow serological assays, the Onsite CTK Biotech COVID-19 split IgG/IgM Rapid Test (CTK Bitotech, Poway, CA, USA) and the Encode SARS-CoV-2 split IgM/IgG One Step Rapid Test Device (Zhuhai Encode Medical Engineering, Zhuhai, China), were evaluated for performance against a laboratory immunoassay (EDI Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 IgG ELISA kit [Epitope Diagnostics, San Diego, CA, USA]) in 300 samples from health-care workers and 100 pre-COVID-19 negative control samples. In phase 2 (n=6440), serosurveillance was done among 1299 (93·4%) of 1391 health-care workers reporting symptoms, and in a subset of asymptomatic health-care workers (405 [8·0%] of 5049).
Findings
There was variation in test performance between the lateral flow serological assays; however, the Encode assay displayed reasonable IgG sensitivity (127 of 136; 93·4% [95% CI 87·8–96·9]) and specificity (99 of 100; 99·0% [94·6–100·0]) among PCR-proven cases and good agreement (282 of 300; 94·0% [91·3–96·7]) with the laboratory immunoassay. By contrast, the Onsite assay had reduced sensitivity (120 of 136; 88·2% [95% CI 81·6–93·1]) and specificity (94 of 100; 94·0% [87·4–97·8]) and agreement (254 of 300; 84·7% [80·6–88·7]). Five (7%) of 70 PCR-positive cases were negative across all assays. Late changes in lateral flow serological assay bands were recorded in 74 (9·3%) of 800 cassettes (35 [8·8%] of 400 Encode assays; 39 [9·8%] of 400 Onsite assays), but only seven (all Onsite assays) of these changes were concordant with the laboratory immunoassay. In phase 2, seroprevalence among the workforce was estimated to be 10·6% (95% CI 7·6–13·6) in asymptomatic health-care workers and 44·7% (42·0–47·4) in symptomatic health-care workers. Seroprevalence across the entire workforce was estimated at 18·0% (95% CI 17·0–18·9).
Interpretation
Although a good positive predictive value was observed with both lateral flow serological assays and ELISA, this agreement only occurred if the pre-test probability was modified by a strict clinical case definition. Late development of lateral flow serological assay bands would preclude postal strategies and potentially home testing. Identification of false-negative results among health-care workers across all assays suggest caution in interpretation of IgG results at this stage; for now, testing is perhaps best delivered in a clinical setting, supported by government advice about physical distancing.

Background
Maternal influenza immunisation can reduce morbidity and mortality associated with influenza infection in pregnant women and young infants. We aimed to determine the vaccine efficacy of maternal influenza immunisation against maternal and infant PCR-confirmed influenza, duration of protection, and the effect of gestational age at vaccination on vaccine efficacy, birth outcomes, and infant growth up to 6 months of age.
Methods
We did a pooled analysis of three randomised controlled trials done in Nepal (2011–2014), Mali (2011–2014), and South Africa (2011–2013). Pregnant women, gestational age 17–34 weeks in Nepal, 28 weeks or more in Mali, and 20–36 weeks in South Africa, were enrolled. Women were randomly assigned 1:1 to a study group, in which they received trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in all three trials, or a control group, in which they received saline placebo in Nepal and South Africa or quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine in Mali. Enrolment at all sites was complete by April 24, 2013. Infants and women were assessed for respiratory illness, and samples from those that met the case definition were tested for influenza by PCR testing. Growth measurements, including length and weight, were obtained at birth at all sites, at 24 weeks in South Africa, and at 6 months in Nepal and Mali. The three trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT01430689, NCT01034254, and NCT02465190.
Findings
10 002 women and 9800 liveborn infants were included. Pooled efficacy of maternal vaccination to prevent infant PCR-confirmed influenza up to 6 months of age was 35% (95% CI 19 to 47). The pooled estimate was 56% (28 to 73) within the first 2 months of life, 39% (11 to 58) between 2 and 4 months, and 19% (–9 to 40) between 4 and 6 months. In women, from enrolment during pregnancy to the end of follow-up at 6 months postpartum, the vaccine was 50% (95% CI 32–63) efficacious against PCR-confirmed influenza. Efficacy was 42% (12 to 61) during pregnancy and 60% (36 to 75) postpartum. In women vaccinated before 29 weeks gestational age, the estimated efficacy was 30% (–2 to 52), and in women vaccinated at or after 29 weeks, efficacy was 71% (50 to 83). Efficacy was similar in infants born to mothers vaccinated before or after 29 weeks gestation (34% [95% CI 12 to 51] vs 35% [11 to 52]). There was no overall association between maternal vaccination and low birthweight, stillbirth, preterm birth, and small for gestational age. At 6 months of age, the intervention and control groups were similar in terms of underweight (weight-for-age), stunted (length-for-age), and wasted (weight-for-length). Median centile change from birth to 6 months of age was similar between the intervention and the control groups for both weight and length.
Interpretation
The assessment of efficacy for women vaccinated before 29 weeks gestational age might have been underpowered, because the point estimate suggests that there might be efficacy despite wide CIs. Estimates of efficacy against PCR-confirmed influenza and safety in terms of adverse birth outcomes should be incorporated into any further consideration of maternal influenza immunisation recommendations.

abstract = "Summary
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly evolved into a global pandemic. Most patients with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but about 5% develop severe symptoms, which can include acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and multiple organ failure. Kidney involvement is frequent, with clinical presentation ranging from mild proteinuria to progressive acute kidney injury (AKI) necessitating renal replacement therapy (RRT). An understanding of the pathophysiology and mechanisms of kidney damage and AKI in the setting of critical illness and COVID-19 is emerging, although further research is needed to identify patients at risk of AKI and to guide management strategies. As no specific treatment options exist for AKI secondary to COVID-19, intensive care is largely supportive. Current approaches to prevention and management of AKI, and identification of potential indications for use of RRT and sequential extracorporeal therapies, are based mainly on clinical experience, and AKI strategies are adapted empirically to patients with COVID-19. International collaborative and cross-disciplinary research is needed to obtain adequate evidence to support current clinical approaches and to develop new approaches to management."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Despite the improvement in the prognosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), substantial morbidity and mortality remain. We aimed to evaluate the effect of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and its treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on the clinical evolution of patients with ACS.
Methods
We designed a multicentre, open-label, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial of patients with ACS at 15 hospitals in Spain. Eligible non-sleepy patients were men and women aged 18 years and older, admitted to hospital for documented symptoms of ACS. All patients underwent respiratory polygraphy during the first 24–72 h after admission. OSA patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to CPAP treatment plus usual care (CPAP group) or usual care alone (UC group) by a computerised system available 24 h a day. A group of patients with ACS but without OSA was also included as a reference group. Because of the nature of the intervention, the trial intervention could not be masked to either investigators or patients. Patients were monitored and followed for a minimum of 1 year. Patients were examined at the time of inclusion; after 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 30 months, and 36 months; and every 12 months thereafter, if applicable, during the follow-up period. The primary endpoint was the prevalence of a composite of cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death or non-fatal events [Acute myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, hospital admission for heart failure, and new hospitalisations for unstable angina or transient ischaemic attack]) in patients followed up for a minimum of 1 year. The primary analysis was done according to the intention-to-treat principle. This study is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01335087 and is now closed.
Findings
Between April 25, 2011, and Feb 2, 2018, a total of 2834 patients with ACS had respiratory polygraphy, of whom 2551 (90·01%) were recruited. 1264 (49·55%) patients had OSA and were randomly assigned to the CPAP group (n=633) or the UC group (n=631). 1287 (50·45%) patients did not have OSA, of whom 603 (46·85%) were randomly assigned to the reference group. Patients were followed up for a median of 3·35 years (IQR 1·50–5·31). The prevalence of cardiovascular events was similar in the CPAP and UC groups (98 events [16%] vs 108 events [17%]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·89 [95% CI 0·68–1·17]; p=0·40) during follow-up. Mean time of adherence to CPAP treatment was 2·78 h/night (SD 2·73). The prevalence of cardiovascular events was similar between patients in the reference group (90 [15%] events) and those in the UC group (102 (17%) events) during follow-up (1·01 [0·76–1·35]; p=0·93). The prevalence of cardiovascular events seem not to be related to CPAP compliance or OSA severity. 464 (74%) of 629 patients in the CPAP group had 1538 serious adverse events and 406 (65%) of 626 patients in the UC group had 1764 serious adverse events.
Interpretation
Among non-sleepy patients with ACS, the presence of OSA was not associated with an increased prevalence of cardiovascular events and treatment with CPAP did not significantly reduce this prevalence.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Pneumonia is the leading cause of death among children globally. Most pneumonia deaths in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) occur among children with HIV infection or exposure, severe malnutrition, or hypoxaemia despite antibiotics and oxygen. Non-invasive bubble continuous positive airway pressure (bCPAP) is considered a safe ventilation modality that might improve child pneumonia survival. bCPAP outcomes for high-risk African children with severe pneumonia are unknown. Since most child pneumonia hospitalisations in Africa occur in non-tertiary district hospitals without daily physician oversight, we aimed to examine whether bCPAP improves severe pneumonia mortality in such settings.
Methods
This open-label, randomised, controlled trial was done in the general paediatric ward of Salima District Hospital, Malawi. We enrolled children aged 1–59 months old with WHO-defined severe pneumonia and either HIV infection or exposure, severe malnutrition, or an oxygen saturation of less than 90%. Children were randomly assigned 1:1 to low-flow nasal cannula oxygen or nasal bCPAP. Non-physicians administered care; the primary outcome was hospital survival. Primary analyses were by intention-to-treat and interim and adverse events analyses per protocol. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02484183, and is closed.
Findings
We screened 1712 children for eligibility between June 23, 2015, and March 21, 2018. The data safety and monitoring board stopped the trial for futility after 644 of the intended 900 participants were enrolled. 323 children were randomly assigned to oxygen and 321 to bCPAP. 35 (11%) of 323 children who received oxygen died in hospital, as did 53 (17%) of 321 who received bCPAP (relative risk 1·52; 95% CI 1·02–2·27; p=0·036). 13 oxygen and 17 bCPAP patients lacked hospital outcomes and were considered lost to follow-up. Suspected adverse events related to treatment occurred in 11 (3%) of 321 children receiving bCPAP and 1 (<1%) of 323 children receiving oxygen. Four bCPAP and one oxygen group deaths were classified as probable aspiration episodes, one bCPAP death as probable pneumothorax, and six non-death bCPAP events included skin breakdown around the nares.
Interpretation
bCPAP treatment in a paediatric ward without daily physician supervision did not reduce hospital mortality among high-risk Malawian children with severe pneumonia, compared with oxygen. The use of bCPAP within certain patient populations and non-intensive care settings might carry risk that was not previously recognised. bCPAP in LMICs needs further evaluation before wider implementation for child pneumonia care.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The COVID-19 pandemic is challenging advanced health systems, which are dealing with an overwhelming number of patients in need of intensive care for respiratory failure, often requiring intubation. Prone positioning in intubated patients is known to reduce mortality in moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. We aimed to investigate feasibility and effect on gas exchange of prone positioning in awake, non-intubated patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia.
Methods
In this prospective, feasibility, cohort study, patients aged 18–75 years with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19-related pneumonia receiving supplemental oxygen or non-invasive continuous positive airway pressure were recruited from San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy. We collected baseline data on demographics, anthropometrics, arterial blood gas, and ventilation parameters. After baseline data collection, patients were helped into the prone position, which was maintained for a minimum duration of 3 h. Clinical data were re-collected 10 min after prone positioning and 1 h after returning to the supine position. The main study outcome was the variation in oxygenation (partial pressure of oxygen [PaO2]/fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired air [FiO2]) between baseline and resupination, as an index of pulmonary recruitment. This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04365959, and is now complete.
Findings
Between March 20 and April 9, 2020, we enrolled 56 patients, of whom 44 (79%) were male; the mean age was 57·4 years (SD 7·4) and the mean BMI was 27·5 kg/m2 (3·7). Prone positioning was feasible (ie, maintained for at least 3 h) in 47 patients (83·9% [95% CI 71·7 to 92·4]). Oxygenation substantially improved from supine to prone positioning (PaO2/FiO2 ratio 180·5 mm Hg [SD 76·6] in supine position vs 285·5 mm Hg [112·9] in prone position; p<0·0001). After resupination, improved oxygenation was maintained in 23 patients (50·0% [95% CI 34·9–65·1]; ie, responders); however, this improvement was on average not significant compared with before prone positioning (PaO2/FiO2 ratio 192·9 mm Hg [100·9] 1 h after resupination; p=0·29). Patients who maintained increased oxygenation had increased levels of inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein: 12·7 mg/L [SD 6·9] in responders vs 8·4 mg/L [6·2] in non-responders; and platelets: 241·1 × 103/μL [101·9] vs 319·8 × 103/μL [120·6]) and shorter time between admission to hospital and prone positioning (2·7 days [SD 2·1] in responders vs 4·6 days [3·7] in non-responders) than did those for whom improved oxygenation was not maintained. 13 (28%) of 46 patients were eventually intubated, seven (30%) of 23 responders and six (26%) of 23 non-responders (p=0·74). Five patients died during follow-up due to underlying disease, unrelated to study procedure.
Interpretation
Prone positioning was feasible and effective in rapidly ameliorating blood oxygenation in awake patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia requiring oxygen supplementation. The effect was maintained after resupination in half of the patients. Further studies are warranted to ascertain the potential benefit of this technique in improving final respiratory and global outcomes.

Despite progress in the supportive care available for critically ill patients, few advances have been made in the search for effective disease-modifying therapeutic options. The fact that many trials in critical care medicine have not identified a treatment benefit is probably due, in part, to the underlying heterogeneity of critical care syndromes. Numerous approaches have been proposed to divide populations of critically ill patients into more meaningful subgroups (subphenotypes), some of which might be more useful than others. Subclassification systems driven by clinical features and biomarkers have been proposed for acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, acute kidney injury, and pancreatitis. Identifying the systems that are most useful and biologically meaningful could lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of critical care syndromes and the discovery of new treatment targets, and allow recruitment in future therapeutic trials to focus on predicted responders. This Review discusses proposed subphenotypes of critical illness syndromes and highlights the issues that will need to be addressed to translate subphenotypes into clinical practice."

abstract = "Summary
Background
A substantial proportion of organ donors test positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. To date, only a few studies have evaluated the safety of using lungs from these donors for transplantation, and no direct interventions to donor organs have been done with the aim of preventing HCV transmission via organ transplantation. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of lung transplantation in humans from HCV-positive donors to HCV-negative recipients after application of ex-vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) plus ultraviolet C (UVC) perfusate irradiation.
Methods
We did a single centre, prospective, open-label, non-randomised trial in which donor lungs from HCV-viraemic donors (HCV-positive) were transplanted into HCV-negative recipients at Toronto General Hospital, University Health Network (Toronto, ON, Canada). Donors were younger than 65 years old and tested positive for HCV by nucleic acid testing. Donors who tested positive for hepatitis B virus, HIV, human T-lymphotropic virus 1 or 2 were excluded. Recipients were on the lung transplant waiting list without significant liver disease (stage 2 fibrosis or higher were excluded) or active HCV infection. Before implantation, all HCV-positive donor lungs were treated with EVLP with or without UVC perfusate irradiation to reduce the concentration of HCV RNA and infectivity. For the first week after transplantation, patients' HCV RNA blood concentrations were measured once daily, then once per week for 12 weeks. All patients received 12 weeks of oral sofosbuvir 400 mg plus velpatasvir 100 mg, starting at least 2 weeks after transplantation. The primary endpoint was a composite of survival and HCV-free status at 6 months after transplantation in all patients who received HCV-positive lungs. Patient outcomes such as survival, time in hospital, and incidence of acute rejection were compared between those receiving HCV-positive lungs and all patients who received HCV-negative lung transplants during the study period. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03112044.
Findings
From Oct 1, 2017, to Nov 1, 2018, 209 patients had a transplantation; of 27 donors who were HCV-positive and initially considered, 22 were suitable for transplantation. The remaining 187 donors were HCV-negative. Before implantation, 11 of the HCV-positive donor lungs were treated with EVLP alone and the other 11 were treated with EVLP plus UVC. Lung disease, urgency status, and positive donor-recipient HLA crossmatch were similar between the patients who received HCV-positive and HCV-negative lungs. 20 (91%) patients in the HCV-positive group developed HCV viraemia within the first week after transplantation and had sofosbuvir plus velpatasvir treatment, starting at a median of 21 days after transplantation (IQR 16·76–24·75). Donor organ treatment with EVLP plus UVC was associated with significantly lower recipient viral loads in blood within the first week after transplantation than with EVLP alone (median of 167 IU/mL [IQR 20–12 000] vs 4390 IU/mL [1170–112 000] at day 7; p=0·048) and prevented transmission in two (18%) of 11 patients. All 20 infected patients achieved negative HCV PCR within 6 weeks of treatment initiation. The primary endpoint of survival and HCV-free status at 6 months after transplantation was achieved in 19 (86%) of 22 patients in the HCV-positive group. 6-month survival was 95% in recipients receiving lungs from HCV-viraemic donors versus 94% in recipients receiving lungs from HCV-negative donors. The most common grade 3–4 adverse events in the HCV-positive group were respiratory complications (five [23%]) and infections (four [18%]). Serious adverse events requiring admission to hospital occurred in ten (45%) patients. One (5%) patient who did not develop HCV infection died at day 31 from multiorgan failure related to pseudomonas sepsis. Two patients presented with HCV relapse within 3 months after sofosbuvir plus velpatasvir completion and required retreatment.
Interpretation
Early and intermediate clinical outcomes were not significantly different between patients receiving viraemic HCV donor lungs and HCV-negative donor lungs. Donor organ treatment with UVC perfusate irradiation during EVLP significantly decreased HCV viral loads within the first 7 days after transplantation and shows the proof-of-concept for a novel approach of minimising viral load ex vivo before transplantation, with intent of preventing donor–recipient transmission.

abstract = "Summary
Background
An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China. Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce. We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.
Methods
In this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.
Findings
Of 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included. The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever. 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively. Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax. 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation. Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.
Interpretation
The mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable. The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission. Older patients (>65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.

Over the past decade, there has been a groundswell of research interest in computer-based methods for objectively quantifying fibrotic lung disease on high resolution CT of the chest. In the past 5 years, the arrival of deep learning-based image analysis has created exciting new opportunities for enhancing the understanding of, and the ability to interpret, fibrotic lung disease on CT. Specific unsolved problems for which computer-based imaging analysis might provide solutions include the development of reliable methods for assisting with diagnosis, detecting early disease, and predicting disease behaviour using baseline imaging data. However, to harness this technology, technical and societal challenges must be overcome. Large CT datasets will be needed to power the training of deep learning algorithms. Open science research and collaboration between academia and industry must be encouraged. Prospective clinical utility studies will be needed to test computer algorithm performance in real-world clinical settings and demonstrate patient benefit over current best practice. Finally, ethical standards, which ensure patient confidentiality and mitigate against biases in training datasets, that can be encoded in machine-learning systems will be needed as well as bespoke data governance and accountability frameworks to encourage buy-in from health-care professionals, patients, and the public."

abstract = "Executive summary
The past six decades have seen remarkable improvements in health outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis, which was once a fatal disease of infants and young children. However, although life expectancy for people with cystic fibrosis has increased substantially, the disease continues to limit survival and quality of life, and results in a large burden of care for people with cystic fibrosis and their families. Furthermore, epidemiological studies in the past two decades have shown that cystic fibrosis occurs and is more frequent than was previously thought in populations of non-European descent, and the disease is now recognised in many regions of the world. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine Commission on the future of cystic fibrosis care was established at a time of great change in the clinical care of people with the disease, with a growing population of adult patients, widespread genetic testing supporting the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, and the development of therapies targeting defects in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which are likely to affect the natural trajectory of the disease. The aim of the Commission was to bring to the attention of patients, health-care professionals, researchers, funders, service providers, and policy makers the various challenges associated with the changing landscape of cystic fibrosis care and the opportunities available for progress, providing a blueprint for the future of cystic fibrosis care. The discovery of the CFTR gene in the late 1980s triggered a surge of basic research that enhanced understanding of the pathophysiology and the genotype–phenotype relationships of this clinically variable disease. Until recently, available treatments could only control symptoms and restrict the complications of cystic fibrosis, but advances in CFTR modulator therapies to address the basic defect of cystic fibrosis have been remarkable and the field is evolving rapidly. However, CFTR modulators approved for use to date are highly expensive, which has prompted questions about the affordability of new treatments and served to emphasise the considerable gap in health outcomes for patients with cystic fibrosis between high-income countries, and low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Advances in clinical care have been multifaceted and include earlier diagnosis through the implementation of newborn screening programmes, formalised airway clearance therapy, and reduced malnutrition through the use of effective pancreatic enzyme replacement and a high-energy, high-protein diet. Centre-based care has become the norm in high-income countries, allowing patients to benefit from the skills of expert members of multidisciplinary teams. Pharmacological interventions to address respiratory manifestations now include drugs that target airway mucus and airway surface liquid hydration, and antimicrobial therapies such as antibiotic eradication treatment in early-stage infections and protocols for maintenance therapy of chronic infections. Despite the recent breakthrough with CFTR modulators for cystic fibrosis, the development of novel mucolytic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-infective therapies is likely to remain important, especially for patients with more advanced stages of lung disease. As the median age of patients with cystic fibrosis increases, with a rapid increase in the population of adults living with the disease, complications of cystic fibrosis are becoming increasingly common. Steps need to be taken to ensure that enough highly qualified professionals are present in cystic fibrosis centres to meet the needs of ageing patients, and new technologies need to be adopted to support communication between patients and health-care providers. In considering the future of cystic fibrosis care, the Commission focused on five key areas, which are discussed in this report: the changing epidemiology of cystic fibrosis (section 1); future challenges of clinical care and its delivery (section 2); the building of cystic fibrosis care globally (section 3); novel therapeutics (section 4); and patient engagement (section 5). In panel 1, we summarise key messages of the Commission. The challenges faced by all stakeholders in building and developing cystic fibrosis care globally are substantial, but many opportunities exist for improved care and health outcomes for patients in countries with established cystic fibrosis care programmes, and in LMICs where integrated multidisciplinary care is not available and resources are lacking at present. A concerted effort is needed to ensure that all patients with cystic fibrosis have access to high-quality health care in the future."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Staphylococcus aureus is the bacterium cultured most often from respiratory secretions of people with cystic fibrosis. Both meticillin-susceptible S aureus and meticillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) can adapt to form slow-growing, antibiotic-resistant isolates known as small-colony variants that are not routinely identified by clinical laboratories. We aimed to determine the prevalence and clinical significance of S aureus small-colony variants and their subtypes among children with cystic fibrosis.
Methods
The Small Colony Variant Staphylococcus aureus (SCVSA) study was a 2-year longitudinal study of children aged 6–16 years at five US cystic fibrosis centres, using culture methods sensitive for small-colony variants. Children were eligible if they had a documented diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and a minimum of two cystic fibrosis clinic visits and two respiratory cultures in the previous 12 months at enrolment. Participants attended clinic visits quarterly, at which respiratory tract samples were taken and measures of lung function (percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1] and frequency of respiratory exacerbations) were recorded. We determined the prevalence of small-colony variants and their subtypes, and assessed their independent associations with lung function and respiratory exacerbations using linear mixed-effects and generalised estimating equation logistic regression models. Analyses included both univariate models (unadjusted) and multivariate models that adjusted for potential confounders, including age, sex, race, baseline microbiology, treatment with CFTR modulator, and CTFR genotype.
Findings
Between July 1, 2014, and May 26, 2015, we enrolled 230 children. Participants were followed-up for 2 years, with a mean of 6·4 visits (SD 1·14) per participant (range 2–9 visits) and a mean interval between visits of 3·94 months (SD 1·77). Across the 2-year period, S aureus small-colony variants were detected in 64 (28%) participants. Most (103 [56%] of 185) of the small-colony variants detected in these participants were thymidine dependent. Children with small-colony variants had significantly lower mean percentage of predicted FEV1 at baseline than did children without small-colony variants (85·5 [SD 19] vs 92·4 [SD 18·6]; p=0·0145). Small-colony variants were associated with significantly lower percentage of predicted FEV1 throughout the study in regression models, both in univariate analyses (regression coefficient −7·07, 95% CI −12·20 to −1·95; p=0·0068) and in multivariate analyses adjusting for potential confounders (−5·50, −10·51 to −0·48; p=0·0316). Small colony variants of the thymidine-dependent subtype had the strongest association with lung function in multivariate regression models (regression coefficient −10·49, −17·25 to −3·73; p=0·0024). Compared with children without small-colony variants, those with small-colony variants had significantly increased odds of respiratory exacerbations in univariate analyses (odds ratio 1·73, 95% CI 1·19 to 2·52; p=0·0045). Children with thymidine-dependent small-colony variants had significantly increased odds of respiratory exacerbations (2·81, 1·69–4·67; p=0·0001), even after adjusting for age, sex, race, genotype, CFTR modulator, P aeruginosa culture status, and baseline percentage of predicted FEV1 (2·17, 1·33–3·57; p=0·0021), whereas those with non-thymidine-dependent small-colony variants did not. In multivariate models including small-colony variants and MRSA status, P aeruginosa was not independently associated with lung function (regression coefficient −4·77, 95% CI −10·36 to 0·83; p=0·10) and was associated with reduced odds of exacerbations (0·54, 0·36 to 0·81; p=0·0028). Only the small-colony variant form of MRSA was associated with reduced lung function (−8·44, −16·15 to −0·72; p=0·0318) and increased odds of exacerbations (2·15, 1·24 to 3·71; p=0·0061).
Interpretation
Infection with small-colony variants, and particularly thymidine-dependent small-colony variants, was common in a multicentre paediatric population with cystic fibrosis and associated with reduced lung function and increased risk of respiratory exacerbations. The adoption of small-colony variant identification and subtyping methods by clinical laboratories, and the inclusion of small-colony variant prevalence data in cystic fibrosis registries, should be considered for ongoing surveillance and study.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Since the 1918 influenza pandemic, non-randomised studies and small clinical trials have suggested that convalescent plasma or anti-influenza hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin (hIVIG) might have clinical benefit for patients with influenza infection, but definitive data do not exist. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hIVIG in a randomised controlled trial.
Methods
This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was planned for 45 hospitals in Argentina, Australia, Denmark, Greece, Mexico, Spain, Thailand, UK, and the USA over five influenza seasons from 2013–14 to 2017–18. Adults (≥18 years of age) were admitted for hospital treatment with laboratory-confirmed influenza A or B infection and were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive standard care plus either a single 500-mL infusion of high-titre hIVIG (0·25 g/kg bodyweight, 24·75 g maximum; hIVIG group) or saline placebo (placebo group). Eligible patients had a National Early Warning score of 2 points or greater at the time of screening and their symptoms began no more than 7 days before randomisation. Pregnant and breastfeeding women were excluded, as well as any patients for whom the treatment would present a health risk. Separate randomisation schedules were generated for each participating clinical site using permuted block randomisation. Treatment assignments were obtained using a web-based application by the site pharmacist who then masked the solution for infusion. Patients and investigators were masked to study treatment. The primary endpoint was a six-category ordinal outcome of clinical status at day 7, ranging in severity from death to resumption of normal activities after discharge. The choice of day 7 was based on haemagglutination inhibition titres from a pilot study. It was analysed with a proportional odds model, using all six categories to estimate a common odds ratio (OR). An OR greater than 1 indicated that, for a given category, patients in the hIVIG group were more likely to be in a better category than those in the placebo group. Prespecified primary analyses for safety and efficacy were based on patients who received an infusion and for whom eligibility could be confirmed. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02287467.
Findings
313 patients were enrolled in 34 sites between Dec 11, 2014, and May 28, 2018. We also used data from 16 patients enrolled at seven of the 34 sites during the pilot study between Jan 15, 2014, and April 10, 2014. 168 patients were randomly assigned to the hIVIG group and 161 to the placebo group. 21 patients were excluded (12 from the hIVIG group and 9 from the placebo group) because they did not receive an infusion or their eligibility could not be confirmed. Thus, 308 were included in the primary analysis. hIVIG treatment produced a robust rise in haemagglutination inhibition titres against influenza A and smaller rises in influenza B titres. Based on the proportional odds model, the OR on day 7 was 1·25 (95% CI 0·79–1·97; p=0·33). In subgroup analyses for the primary outcome, the OR in patients with influenza A was 0·94 (0·55–1·59) and was 3·19 (1·21–8·42) for those with influenza B (interaction p=0·023). Through 28 days of follow-up, 47 (30%) of 156 patients in the hIVIG group and in 45 (30%) of 152 patients in the placebo group had the composite safety outcome of death, a serious adverse event, or a grade 3 or 4 adverse event (hazard ratio [HR] 1·06, 95% CI 0·70–1·60; p=0·79). Six (4%) patients in the hIVIG group and five (3%) in the placebo group died, but these deaths were not necessarily related to treatment.
Interpretation
When administered alongside standard care (most commonly oseltamivir), hIVIG was not superior to placebo for adults hospitalised with influenza infection. By contrast with our prespecified subgroup hypothesis that hIVIG would result in more favourable responses in patients with influenza A than B, we found the opposite effect. The clinical benefit of hIVIG for patients with influenza B is supported by antibody affinity analyses, but confirmation is warranted.

Background
Although use of inhaled antibiotics is the standard of care in cystic fibrosis, there is insufficient evidence to support use of inhaled antibiotics in patients with bronchiectasis not due to cystic fibrosis. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of inhaled antibiotics for the long-term treatment of adults with bronchiectasis and chronic respiratory tract infections.
Methods
We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of all randomised controlled trials of inhaled-antibiotic use in adult patients with bronchiectasis and chronic respiratory tract infections. Eligible publications were identified by searching MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Randomised controlled trials of inhaled antibiotics were included if the patients were adults with stable bronchiectasis diagnosed by CT or bronchography, the trials had treatment a duration of at least 4 weeks, and their outcomes met at least one of the endpoints of interest. Studies in cystic fibrosis were excluded. Efficacy endpoints assessed were bacterial load, bacterial eradication from sputum, frequency of exacerbations, time to first exacerbation, proportion of patients with at least one exacerbation, frequency of severe exacerbations, quality of life, change in FEV1, 6-min walk distance, mortality, adherence to treatment, and sputum volume; safety endpoints were adverse events and bacterial resistance in sputum. Each study was independently reviewed for methodological quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool individual studies. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2. The review is registered on PROSPERO, number CRD42019122892.
Findings
16 trials (n=2597 patients) were included for analysis. The mean reduction of colony forming units per g of sputum with inhaled antibiotics was −2·32 log units (95% CI −3·20 to −1·45; p<0·0001). Bacterial eradication was increased with inhaled antibiotic therapy (odds ratio [OR] 3·36, 1·63 to 6·91; p=0·0010). Inhaled antibiotics significantly reduced exacerbation frequency (rate ratio 0·81, 0·67 to 0·97; p=0·020). Time to first exacerbation was significantly prolonged with inhaled antibiotics (hazard ratio 0·83, 0·69 to 0·99; p=0·028). The proportion of patients with at least one exacerbation decreased (risk ratio 0·85, 0·74 to 0·97; p=0·015). There was a significant reduction in the frequency of severe exacerbations (rate ratio 0·43, 0·24 to 0·78; p=0·0050). The scores for neither the Quality of Life Bronchiectasis questionnaire nor St George's Respiratory Questionnaire improved above the minimal clinically important difference. The relative change in FEV1 was a deterioration of 0·87% predicted value (−2·00 to 0·26%; p=0·13). Other efficacy endpoints were reported in only few studies or had few events. There was no difference in treatment-emergent adverse effects (OR 0·97, 0·67 to 1·40; p=0·85) or bronchospasm (0·99, 0·66 to 1·48; p=0·95). Emergence of bacterial resistance was evident at the end of the treatment period (risk ratio 1·91, 1·46 to 2·49; p<0·0001).
Interpretation
Inhaled antibiotics are well tolerated, reduce bacterial load, and achieve a small but statistically significant reduction in exacerbation frequency without clinically significant improvements in quality of life in patients with bronchiectasis and chronic respiratory tract infections.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Multiple blood transcriptional signatures have been proposed for identification of active and incipient tuberculosis. We aimed to compare the performance of systematically identified candidate signatures for incipient tuberculosis and to benchmark these against WHO targets.
Methods
We did a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis. We searched Medline and Embase for candidate whole blood mRNA signatures discovered with the primary objective of diagnosis of active or incipient tuberculosis, compared with controls who were healthy or had latent tuberculosis infection. We tested the performance of eligible signatures in whole blood transcriptomic datasets, in which sampling before tuberculosis diagnosis was done and time to disease was available. Culture-confirmed and clinically or radiologically diagnosed pulmonary or extrapulmonary tuberculosis cases were included. Non-progressor (individuals who remained tuberculosis-free during follow-up) samples with less than 6 months of follow-up from the date of sample collection were excluded, as were participants with prevalent tuberculosis and those who received preventive therapy. Scores were calculated for candidate signatures for each participant in the pooled dataset. Receiver operating characteristic curves, sensitivities, and specificities were examined using prespecified intervals to tuberculosis (<3 months, <6 months, <1 year, and <2 years) from sample collection. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42019135618.
Results
We tested 17 candidate mRNA signatures in a pooled dataset from four eligible studies comprising 1126 samples. This dataset included 183 samples from 127 incipient tuberculosis cases in South Africa, Ethiopia, The Gambia, and the UK. Eight signatures (comprising 1–25 transcripts) that predominantly reflect interferon and tumour necrosis factor-inducible gene expression, had equivalent diagnostic accuracy for incipient tuberculosis over a 2-year period with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves ranging from 0·70 (95% CI 0·64–0·76) to 0·77 (0·71–0·82). The sensitivity of all eight signatures declined with increasing disease-free time interval. Using a threshold derived from two SDs above the mean of uninfected controls to prioritise specificity and positive-predictive value, the eight signatures achieved sensitivities of 24·7–39·9% over 24 months and of 47·1–81·0% over 3 months, with corresponding specificities of more than 90%. Based on pre-test probability of 2%, the eight signatures achieved positive-predictive values ranging from 6·8–9·4% over 24 months and 11·2–14·4% over 3 months. When using biomarker thresholds maximising sensitivity and specificity with equal weighting to both, no signature met the minimum WHO target product profile parameters for incipient tuberculosis biomarkers over a 2-year period.
Interpretation
Blood transcriptional biomarkers reflect short-term risk of tuberculosis and only exceed WHO benchmarks if applied to 3–6-month intervals. Serial testing among carefully selected target groups might be required for optimal implementation of these biomarkers.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Patients with asthma who are inadequately controlled on inhaled corticosteroid–long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonist (ICS–LABA) combinations might benefit from the addition of a long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist. The aim of the IRIDIUM study was to assess the efficacy and safety of a once-daily, single-inhaler combination of mometasone furoate, indacaterol acetate, and glycopyrronium bromide (MF–IND–GLY) versus ICS–LABA in patients with inadequately controlled asthma.
Methods
In this 52-week, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, active-controlled phase 3 study, patients were recruited from 415 sites across 41 countries. Patients aged 18 to 75 years with symptomatic asthma despite treatment with medium-dose or high-dose ICS–LABA, at least one exacerbation in the previous year, and a percentage of predicted FEV1 of less than 80% were included. Enrolled patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1) via interactive response technology to receive medium-dose or high-dose MF–IND–GLY (80 μg, 150 μg, 50 μg; 160 μg, 150 μg, 50 μg) or MF–IND (160 μg, 150 μg; 320 μg, 150 μg) once daily via Breezhaler, or high-dose fluticasone–salmeterol (FLU–SAL; 500 μg, 50 μg) twice daily via Diskus. The primary outcome was change from baseline in trough FEV1 with MF–IND–GLY versus MF–IND at week 26 in patients in the full analysis set, analysed by means of a mixed model for repeated measures. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02571777, and is completed.
Findings
Between Dec 8, 2015, and Jun 14, 2019, 3092 of 4851 patients screened were randomly assigned (medium-dose MF–IND–GLY, n=620; high-dose MF–IND–GLY, n=619; medium-dose MF–IND, n=617; high-dose MF–IND, n=618; high-dose FLU–SAL, n=618). 2747 (88·8%) patients completed the 52-week treatment and 321 (10·4%) started but discontinued study treatment prematurely. Medium-dose MF–IND–GLY (treatment difference [Δ] 76 mL [95% CI 41–111]; p<0·001) and high-dose MF–IND–GLY (Δ 65 mL [31–99]; p<0·001) showed superior improvement in trough FEV1 versus corresponding doses of MF–IND at week 26. Improvements in trough FEV1 were greater for both medium-dose MF–IND–GLY (99 mL [64–133]; p<0·001) and high-dose MF–IND–GLY (119 mL [85–154]; p<0·001) than for high-dose FLU–SAL at week 26. Overall, the incidence of adverse events was balanced across the treatment groups. Seven deaths were reported (one with medium-dose MF–IND–GLY, two with high-dose MF–IND–GLY, and four with high-dose MF–IND) during the study; none of these deaths was considered by the investigators to be caused by study drugs or other study-related factors.
Interpretation
Once-daily, single-inhaler MF–IND–GLY improved lung function versus ICS–LABA combinations (MF–IND and FLU–SAL) in patients with inadequately controlled asthma. The safety profile was similar across treatment groups. MF–IND–GLY therefore constitutes a good treatment option in these patients.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Blood transcriptional signatures are candidates for non-sputum triage or confirmatory tests of tuberculosis. Prospective head-to-head comparisons of their diagnostic accuracy in real-world settings are necessary to assess their clinical use. We aimed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of candidate transcriptional signatures identified by systematic review, in a setting with a high burden of tuberculosis and HIV.
Methods
We did a prospective observational study nested within a diagnostic accuracy study of sputum Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) and Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Ultra) tests for pulmonary tuberculosis. We recruited consecutive symptomatic adults aged 18 years or older self-presenting to a tuberculosis clinic in Cape Town, South Africa. Participants provided blood for RNA sequencing, and sputum samples for liquid culture and molecular testing using Xpert and Ultra. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of candidate blood transcriptional signatures for active tuberculosis (including those intended to distinguish active tuberculosis from other diseases) identified by systematic review, compared with culture or Xpert MTB/RIF positivity as the standard reference. In our primary analysis, patients with tuberculosis were defined as those with either a positive liquid culture or Xpert result. Patients with missing blood RNA or sputum results were excluded. Our primary objective was to benchmark the diagnostic accuracy of candidate transcriptional signatures against the WHO target product profile (TPP) for a tuberculosis triage test.
Findings
Between Feb 12, 2016, and July 18, 2017, we obtained paired sputum and RNA sequencing data from 181 participants, 54 (30%) of whom had confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis. Of 27 eligible signatures identified by systematic review, four achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy with similar area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (Sweeney3: 90·6% [95% CI 85·6–95·6]; Kaforou25: 86·9% [80·9–92·9]; Roe3: 86·9% [80·3–93·5]; and BATF2: 86·8% [80·6–93·1]), independent of age, sex, HIV status, previous tuberculosis, or sputum smear result. At test thresholds that gave 70% specificity (the minimum WHO TPP specificity for a triage test), these four signatures achieved sensitivities between 83·3% (95% CI 71·3–91·0) and 90·7% (80·1–96·0). No signature met the optimum criteria, of 95% sensitivity and 80% specificity proposed by WHO for a triage test, or the minimum criteria (of 65% sensitivity and 98% specificity) for a confirmatory test, but all four correctly identified Ultra-positive, culture-negative patients.
Interpretation
Selected blood transcriptional signatures met the minimum WHO benchmarks for a tuberculosis triage test but not for a confirmatory test. Further development of the signatures is warranted to investigate their possible effects on clinical and health economic outcomes as part of a triage strategy, or when used as add-on confirmatory test in conjunction with the highly sensitive Ultra test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA.

abstract = "Summary
Background
There is no proven specific pharmacological treatment for patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The efficacy of corticosteroids in ARDS remains controversial. We aimed to assess the effects of dexamethasone in ARDS, which might change pulmonary and systemic inflammation and result in a decrease in duration of mechanical ventilation and mortality.
Methods
We did a multicentre, randomised controlled trial in a network of 17 intensive care units (ICUs) in teaching hospitals across Spain in patients with established moderate-to-severe ARDS (defined by a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen of 200 mm Hg or less assessed with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 10 cm H2O or more and FiO2 of 0·5 or more at 24 h after ARDS onset). Patients with brain death, terminal-stage disease, or receiving corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs were excluded. Eligible patients were randomly assigned based on balanced treatment assignments with a computerised randomisation allocation sequence using blocks of 10 opaque, sealed envelopes to receive immediate treatment with dexamethasone or continued routine intensive care (control group). Patients in the dexamethasone group received an intravenous dose of 20 mg once daily from day 1 to day 5, which was reduced to 10 mg once daily from day 6 to day 10. Patients in both groups were ventilated with lung-protective mechanical ventilation. Allocation concealment was maintained at all sites during the trial. Primary outcome was the number of ventilator-free days at 28 days, defined as the number of days alive and free from mechanical ventilation from day of randomisation to day 28. Secondary outcome was all-cause mortality 60 days after randomisation. All analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01731795.
Findings
Between March 28, 2013, and Dec 31, 2018, we enrolled 277 patients and randomly assigned 139 patients to the dexamethasone group and 138 to the control group. The trial was stopped by the data safety monitoring board due to low enrolment rate after enrolling more than 88% (277/314) of the planned sample size. The mean number of ventilator-free days was higher in the dexamethasone group than in the control group (between-group difference 4·8 days [95% CI 2·57 to 7·03]; p<0·0001). At 60 days, 29 (21%) patients in the dexamethasone group and 50 (36%) patients in the control group had died (between-group difference −15·3% [–25·9 to −4·9]; p=0·0047). The proportion of adverse events did not differ significantly between the dexamethasone group and control group. The most common adverse events were hyperglycaemia in the ICU (105 [76%] patients in the dexamethasone group vs 97 [70%] patients in the control group), new infections in the ICU (eg, pneumonia or sepsis; 33 [24%] vs 35 [25%]), and barotrauma (14 [10%] vs 10 [7%]).
Interpretation
Early administration of dexamethasone could reduce duration of mechanical ventilation and overall mortality in patients with established moderate-to-severe ARDS.

abstract = "Summary
Background
European estimates of the burden imposed by pulmonary embolism are not available to this date. We aimed to assess pulmonary embolism-related mortality and time trends in the WHO European Region.
Methods
We analysed vital registration data from the WHO Mortality Database (2000–15) covering subregions of the WHO European Region: Eastern Europe, Northern Europe, Southern Europe, Western Europe, and Central Asia. Deaths were considered pulmonary embolism-related if International Classification of Disease-10 code for acute pulmonary embolism (I26) or any code for deep or superficial vein thrombosis was listed as the primary cause of death. We used locally estimated scatterplot smoothing weighted by size of the Member State population to calculate proportionate mortality and time trends in age-standardised mortality.
Findings
In the 3-year period between 2013 and 2015, an average of 38 929 pulmonary embolism-related deaths occurred annually in the 41 Member States with available data and a population of 650 950 921; among individuals aged 15–55 years, pulmonary embolism accounted for 8–13 per 1000 deaths in women and 2–7 per 1000 deaths in men. Between 2000 and 2015, age-standardised annual pulmonary embolism-related mortality rates decreased linearly from 12·8 (95% CI 11·4–14·2) to 6·5 (5·3–7·7) deaths per 100 000 population without substantial sex-specific differences.
Interpretation
The observed decreasing trends in pulmonary embolism-related mortality might reflect improved management of the disease, in line with case fatality data from cohort studies. Additional, or alternative, explanations might include the absence of a uniform case definition and changes in coding practices and performing autopsy. Pulmonary embolism still imposes a relevant medical and societal burden. Continuing efforts are warranted to improve awareness and implement effective preventive and therapeutic measures.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Ultra) is a new test for tuberculosis undergoing global roll-out. We assessed the performance of Ultra compared with Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) in an HIV-endemic setting where previous tuberculosis is frequent and current test performance is suboptimal.
Methods
In this two-cohort diagnostic accuracy study, we used sputum samples from patients in South Africa to evaluate the accuracy of Ultra and Xpert against a single culture reference standard. For the first cohort (cohort A), we recruited adults (aged ≥18 years) with symptoms of presumptive tuberculosis at Scottsdene clinic in Cape Town, South Africa. We collected three sputum samples from each patient in cohort A, two at the first visit of which one was tested using Xpert and the other was tested using culture, and one sample the next morning which was tested using Ultra. In a separate cohort of patients with presumptive tuberculosis and recent previous tuberculosis (≤2 years) who had submitted sputum samples to the National Health Laboratory Services (cohort B), decontaminated sediments were, after processing, randomly allocated (1:1) for testing with Ultra or Xpert. For both cohorts we calculated the sensitivity and specificity of Ultra and Xpert and evaluated the effects of different methods of interpreting Ultra trace results.
Findings
Between Feb 6, 2016, and Feb 2, 2018, we recruited 302 people into cohort A, all of whom provided sputum samples and 239 were included in the head-to-head analyses of Ultra and Xpert. For cohort B, we collected sputum samples from eligible patients who had submitted samples between Dec 6, 2016, and Dec 21, 2017, to give a cohort of 831 samples, of which 352 were eligible for inclusion in analyses and randomly assigned to Ultra (n=173) or Xpert (n=179). In cohort A, Ultra gave more non-actionable results (not positive or negative) than did Xpert (28 [10%] 275 vs 14 [5%] 301; p=0·011). In the head-to-head analysis, in smear-negative patients, sensitivity of Ultra was 80% (95% CI 64–90) and of Xpert was 73% (57–85; p=0·45). Overall, specificity of Ultra was lower than that of Xpert (90% [84–94] vs 99% [95–100]; p=0·001). In cohort B, overall sensitivity was 92% (81–98) for Xpert versus 86% (73–95; p=0·36) for Ultra and overall specificity was 69% (60–77) for Ultra versus 84% (78–91; p=0·005) for Xpert. Ultra specificity estimates improved after reclassification of results with the lowest Ultra-positive semiquantitation category (trace) to negative (15% [8–22]). In cohort A, the positive predictive value (PPV) for Ultra was 78% (67–87) and for Xpert was 96% (87–99; p=0·004); in cohort B, the PPV for Ultra was 50% (43–57) and for Xpert was 70% (61–78; p=0·014). Ultra PPV estimates in previously treated patients were low: at 15% tuberculosis prevalence, half of Ultra-positive patients with presumptive tuberculosis would be culture negative, increasing to approximately 70% in patients with recent previous tuberculosis. In cohort B, 21 (28%) of 76 samples that were Ultra positive were rifampicin indeterminate (all trace) and, like cohort A, most were culture negative (19 [90%] of 21).
Interpretation
In a setting with a high burden of previous tuberculosis, Ultra generated more non-actionable results and had diminished specificity compared with Xpert. In patients with recent previous tuberculosis, a quarter of Ultra-positive samples were indeterminate for rifampicin resistance and culture negative, suggesting that additional drug-resistance testing will probably be unsuccessful. Our data have implications for the handling of Ultra-positive results in patients with previous tuberculosis in high burden settings.

abstract = "Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health crisis, with considerable mortality and morbidity exerting pressure on health-care resources, including critical care. An excessive host inflammatory response in a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 might contribute to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure. Timely therapeutic intervention with immunomodulation in patients with hyperinflammation could prevent disease progression to ARDS and obviate the need for invasive ventilation. Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is an immunoregulatory cytokine with a pivotal role in initiation and perpetuation of inflammatory diseases. GM-CSF could link T-cell-driven acute pulmonary inflammation with an autocrine, self-amplifying cytokine loop leading to monocyte and macrophage activation. This axis has been targeted in cytokine storm syndromes and chronic inflammatory disorders. Here, we consider the scientific rationale for therapeutic targeting of GM-CSF in COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation. Since GM-CSF also has a key role in homoeostasis and host defence, we discuss potential risks associated with inhibition of GM-CSF in the context of viral infection and the challenges of doing clinical trials in this setting, highlighting in particular the need for a patient risk-stratification algorithm."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread rapidly across the USA, causing extensive morbidity and mortality, particularly in the African American community. Autopsy can considerably contribute to our understanding of many disease processes and could provide crucial information to guide management of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We report on the relevant cardiopulmonary findings in, to our knowledge, the first autopsy series of ten African American decedents, with the cause of death attributed to COVID-19.
Methods
Autopsies were performed on ten African American decedents aged 44–78 years with cause of death attributed to COVID-19, reflective of the dominant demographic of deaths following COVID-19 diagnosis in New Orleans. Autopsies were done with consent of the decedents' next of kin. Pulmonary and cardiac features were examined, with relevant immunostains to characterise the inflammatory response, and RNA labelling and electron microscopy on representative sections.
Findings
Important findings include the presence of thrombosis and microangiopathy in the small vessels and capillaries of the lungs, with associated haemorrhage, that significantly contributed to death. Features of diffuse alveolar damage, including hyaline membranes, were present, even in patients who had not been ventilated. Cardiac findings included individual cell necrosis without lymphocytic myocarditis. There was no evidence of secondary pulmonary infection by microorganisms.
Interpretation
We identify key pathological states, including thrombotic and microangiopathic pathology in the lungs, that contributed to death in patients with severe COVID-19 and decompensation in this demographic. Management of these patients should include treatment to target these pathological mechanisms.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Whether blood eosinophil counts and exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) are associated with important outcomes in mild asthma is unclear. In this prespecified subgroup analysis of a previously published open-label clinical trial, we aimed to assess associations between blood eosinophil counts and FeNO with outcomes and response to asthma treatment.
Methods
In the previously reported 52-week, open-label, randomised controlled trial, people with mild asthma receiving only β agonist reliever inhalers were enrolled at one of 16 clinical trials units in New Zealand, the UK, Italy, or Australia. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1, stratified by country), to receive inhalers to take as-needed salbutamol (two inhalations of 100 μg in a pressurised metered dose inhaler), maintenance budesonide (200 μg twice per day by inhaler) plus as-needed salbutamol (two inhalations of 100 μg), or as-needed budesonide–formoterol (one inhalation of 200 μg budesonide and 6μg formoterol by inhaler). The primary outcome was the annual rates of asthma exacerbations per patient, and in this prespecified subgroup analysis, we assessed whether annual exacerbation rates in each treatment group were significantly different depending on levels of blood eosinophil count, FeNO, or a composite score of both. Analyses were done for patients with available biomarker measurements The study was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12615000999538.
Findings
675 participants were enrolled between March 17, 2016, and Aug 29, 2017, of whom 656 had results for blood eosinophil analysis and 668 had results for FeNO. Of the patients who received as-needed salbutamol, the proportion of patients having a severe exacerbation increased progressively with increasing blood eosinophil count (two [4%] of 49 participants with <0·15 × 109/L, six [6%] of 93 with 0·15 to <0·3 × 109/L, and 15 [19%] of 77 with ≥0·3 × 109/L; p=0·014). There were no significant interactions between blood eosinophil count or FeNO level and the effect of as-needed budesonide–formoterol compared with as-needed salbutamol for either exacerbations or severe exacerbations. However, there were significant interactions between blood eosinophil count subgroups and the effect of maintenance budesonide plus as-needed salbutamol compared with as-needed salbutamol, both for exacerbations (p=0·0006) and severe exacerbations (p=0·0007). Maintenance budesonide plus as-needed salbutamol was more effective than as-needed salbutamol in patients with blood eosinophil counts of 0·3 × 109/L or more, both for exacerbations (rate ratio 0·13 [95% CI 0·05–0·33]) and severe exacerbations (risk odds ratio 0·11 [0·03–0·45]). This difference was not seen for blood eosinophil counts of less than 0·15 × 109/L (1·15 [0·51–1·28] for exacerbations and 5·72 [0·97–33·60] for severe exacerbations). There was no consistent interaction between treatment response and FeNO or the composite score.
Interpretation
In patients with mild asthma, the effects of as-needed budesonide–formoterol on exacerbations are independent of biomarker profile, whereas the benefits of maintenance inhaled budesonide are greater in patients with high blood eosinophil counts than in patients with low counts.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Lung cancer screening with low-dose chest CT (LDCT) reduces the mortality of eligible individuals. Blood signatures might act as a standalone screening tool, refine the selection of patients at risk, or help to classify undetermined nodules detected on LDCT. We previously showed that circulating tumour cells (CTCs) could be detected, using the isolation by size of epithelial tumour cell technique (ISET), long before the cancer was diagnosed radiologically. We aimed to test whether CTCs could be used as a biomarker for lung cancer screening.
Methods
We did a prospective, multicentre, cohort study in 21 French university centres. Participants had to be eligible for lung cancer screening as per National Lung Screening Trial criteria and have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a fixed airflow limitation defined as post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 0·7. Any cancer, other than basocellular skin carcinomas, detected within the previous 5 years was the main exclusion criterion. Participants had three screening rounds at 1-year intervals (T0 [baseline], T1, and T2), which involved LDCT, clinical examination, and a blood test for CTCs detection. Participants and investigators were masked to the results of CTC detection, and cytopathologists were masked to clinical and radiological findings. Our primary objective was to test the diagnostic performance of CTC detection using the ISET technique in lung cancer screening, compared with cancers diagnosed by final pathology, or follow up if pathology was unavailable as the gold standard. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, number NCT02500693.
Findings
Between Oct 30, 2015, and Feb 2, 2017, we enrolled 614 participants, predominantly men (437 [71%]), aged 65·1 years (SD 6·5), and heavy smokers (52·7 pack-years [SD 21·5]). 81 (13%) participants dropped out between baseline and T1, and 56 (11%) did between T1 and T2. Nodules were detected on 178 (29%) of 614 baseline LDCTs. 19 participants (3%) were diagnosed with a prevalent lung cancer at T0 and 19 were diagnosed with incident lung cancer (15 (3%) of 533 at T1 and four (1%) of 477 at T2). Extrapulmonary cancers were diagnosed in 27 (4%) of participants. Overall 28 (2%) of 1187 blood samples were not analysable. At baseline, the sensitivity of CTC detection for lung cancer detection was 26·3% (95% CI 11·8–48·8). ISET was unable to predict lung cancer or extrapulmonary cancer development.
Interpretation
CTC detection using ISET is not suitable for lung cancer screening.

Background
Tachycardia and atrial fibrillation frequently occur in patients being treated for sepsis or septic shock and have a poor prognosis. Treatments for tachyarrhythmias are often ineffective or contraindicated in this setting. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of landiolol, an ultra-short-acting β-blocker, for treating sepsis-related tachyarrhythmias.
Methods
We did a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial at 54 hospitals in Japan. Patients admitted to the intensive care units who received conventional treatment for sepsis, according to clinical guidelines for the management of sepsis, and who subsequently developed a tachyarrhythmia, were enrolled. The main inclusion criteria were 20 years of age or older, diagnosis of sepsis according to Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock criteria, administration of catecholamine necessary to maintain mean arterial pressure at 65 mm Hg or more for at least 1 h, and heart rate of 100 beats per min (bpm) or more maintained for at least 10 min without a change in catecholamine dose with diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or sinus tachycardia. Only patients who developed these symptoms and signs within 24 h before randomisation, and within 72 h after entering an intensive care unit, were prospectively assigned to receive conventional sepsis therapy alone (control group) or conventional sepsis therapy plus landiolol (landiolol group) in an open-label manner. Landiolol hydrochloride was intravenously infused at an initial dose of 1 μg/kg per min within 2 h after randomisation and the dose could be increased per study protocol to a maximum of 20 μg/kg per min. Patients in both groups received conventional therapy (Japanese Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock 2016), including respiratory and fluid resuscitation, antimicrobials, and catecholamines. The treating physicians were required to stabilise the patient's haemodynamic status before randomisation. Randomisation was done using a central randomisation system and dynamic allocation with the minimisation method by institution, heart rate at randomisation (≥100 to <120 bpm or ≥120 bpm), and age (<70 years or ≥70 years). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with heart rate of 60–94 bpm at 24 h after randomisation. Patients without heart rate data at 24 h after randomisation were handled as non-responders. The primary outcome was analysed using the full analysis set on an as-assigned basis, while safety was analysed using the safety analysis set according to the treatment received. This study was registered with the Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center Clinical Trials Information database, number JapicCTI-173767.
Findings
Between Jan 16, 2018 and Apr 22, 2019, 151 patients were randomly assigned, 76 to the landiolol group and 75 to the control group. A significantly larger proportion of patients in the landiolol group had a heart rate of 60–94 bpm 24 h after randomisation than in the control group (55% [41 of 75] vs 33% [25 of 75]), with a between-group difference of 23·1% (95% CI 7·1–37·5; p=0·0031). Adverse events were observed in 49 (64%) of 77 patients in the landiolol group and in 44 (59%) of 74 in the control group, with serious adverse events (including adverse events leading to death) in nine (12%) of 77 and eight (11%) of 74 patients. Serious adverse events related to landiolol occurred in five (6%) of 77 patients, including blood pressure decreases in three patients (4%) and cardiac arrest, heart rate decrease, and ejection fraction decrease occurred in one patient each (1%).
Interpretation
Landiolol resulted in significantly more patients with sepsis-related tachyarrhythmia achieving a heart rate of 60–94 bpm at 24 h and significantly reduced the incidence of new-onset arrhythmia. Landiolol was also well tolerated, but it should be used under appropriate monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate owing to the risk of hypotension in patients with sepsis and septic shock.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Ventilator-associated pneumonia is the most common intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired infection, yet accurate diagnosis remains difficult, leading to overuse of antibiotics. Low concentrations of IL-1β and IL-8 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid have been validated as effective markers for exclusion of ventilator-associated pneumonia. The VAPrapid2 trial aimed to determine whether measurement of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid IL-1β and IL-8 could effectively and safely improve antibiotic stewardship in patients with clinically suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia.
Methods
VAPrapid2 was a multicentre, randomised controlled trial in patients admitted to 24 ICUs from 17 National Health Service hospital trusts across England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Patients were screened for eligibility and included if they were 18 years or older, intubated and mechanically ventilated for at least 48 h, and had suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to biomarker-guided recommendation on antibiotics (intervention group) or routine use of antibiotics (control group) using a web-based randomisation service hosted by Newcastle Clinical Trials Unit. Patients were randomised using randomly permuted blocks of size four and six and stratified by site, with allocation concealment. Clinicians were masked to patient assignment for an initial period until biomarker results were reported. Bronchoalveolar lavage was done in all patients, with concentrations of IL-1β and IL-8 rapidly determined in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients randomised to the biomarker-based antibiotic recommendation group. If concentrations were below a previously validated cutoff, clinicians were advised that ventilator-associated pneumonia was unlikely and to consider discontinuing antibiotics. Patients in the routine use of antibiotics group received antibiotics according to usual practice at sites. Microbiology was done on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from all patients and ventilator-associated pneumonia was confirmed by at least 104 colony forming units per mL of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The primary outcome was the distribution of antibiotic-free days in the 7 days following bronchoalveolar lavage. Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis, with an additional per-protocol analysis that excluded patients randomly assigned to the intervention group who defaulted to routine use of antibiotics because of failure to return an adequate biomarker result. An embedded process evaluation assessed factors influencing trial adoption, recruitment, and decision making. This study is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN65937227, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01972425.
Findings
Between Nov 6, 2013, and Sept 13, 2016, 360 patients were screened for inclusion in the study. 146 patients were ineligible, leaving 214 who were recruited to the study. Four patients were excluded before randomisation, meaning that 210 patients were randomly assigned to biomarker-guided recommendation on antibiotics (n=104) or routine use of antibiotics (n=106). One patient in the biomarker-guided recommendation group was withdrawn by the clinical team before bronchoscopy and so was excluded from the intention-to-treat analysis. We found no significant difference in the primary outcome of the distribution of antibiotic-free days in the 7 days following bronchoalveolar lavage in the intention-to-treat analysis (p=0·58). Bronchoalveolar lavage was associated with a small and transient increase in oxygen requirements. Established prescribing practices, reluctance for bronchoalveolar lavage, and dependence on a chain of trial-related procedures emerged as factors that impaired trial processes.
Interpretation
Antibiotic use remains high in patients with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia. Antibiotic stewardship was not improved by a rapid, highly sensitive rule-out test. Prescribing culture, rather than poor test performance, might explain this absence of effect.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Tracheal intubation is common in the care of critically ill adults and is frequently complicated by hypotension, cardiac arrest, or death. We aimed to evaluate administration of an intravenous fluid bolus to prevent cardiovascular collapse during intubation of critically ill adults.
Methods
We did a pragmatic, multicentre, unblinded, randomised trial in nine sites (eight ICUs and one emergency department) around the USA. Critically ill adults (≥18 years) undergoing tracheal intubation were randomly assigned (1:1, block sizes of 2, 4, and 6, stratified by study site) to either an intravenous infusion of 500 mL of crystalloid solution or no fluid bolus. The primary outcome, assessed in the intention-to-treat population, was cardiovascular collapse, defined as a new systolic blood pressure <65 mm Hg; new or increased vasopressor receipt between induction and 2 min after tracheal intubation; or cardiac arrest or death within 1 h of tracheal intubation. Adverse events were assessed in the as-treated population. This trial, which is now complete, is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03026777.
Findings
Patients were enrolled from Feb 6, 2017, to Jan 9, 2018, when the data and safety monitoring board stopped the trial on the basis of futility. By trial termination, 337 (63%) of 537 screened adults had been randomly assigned. Cardiovascular collapse occurred in 33 (20%) of 168 patients in the fluid bolus group compared with 31 (18%) of 169 patients in the no fluid bolus group (absolute difference 1·3% [95% CI −7·1% to 9·7%]; p=0·76). The individual components of the cardiovascular collapse composite outcome did not differ between groups (new systolic blood pressure <65 mm Hg 11 [7%] in the bolus group vs ten [6%] in the no-bolus group, new or increased vasopressor 32 [19%] vs 31 [18%], cardiac arrest within 1 h seven [4%] vs two [1%], death within 1 h of intubation two [1%] vs one [1%]). In-hospital mortality was not significantly different in the fluid bolus group (48 [29%]) compared with no fluid bolus (59 [35%]).
Interpretation
Administration of an intravenous fluid bolus did not decrease the overall incidence of cardiovascular collapse during tracheal intubation of critically ill adults compared with no fluid bolus in this trial.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Resistance to first-generation and second-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is mediated by the emergence of the Thr790Met mutation in 50–60% of treated patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We aimed to assess the safety and activity of nazartinib (EGF816), a third-generation EGFR TKI that selectively inhibits EGFR with Thr790Met or activating mutations (or both), while sparing wild-type EGFR, in patients with advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC.
Methods
This phase 1 dose-escalation part of an open-label, multicentre, phase 1/2 study was conducted at nine academic medical centres located in Europe, Asia, and North America. Patients were included if they were aged 18 years or older and had stage IIIB–IV EGFR-mutant NSCLC (with varying statuses of EGFR mutation and previous therapy allowed), at least one measurable lesion, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2 or less. Nazartinib (at seven dose levels between 75 mg and 350 mg, in capsule or tablet form) was administered orally, once daily, on a continuous 28-day dosing schedule. A two-parameter Bayesian logistic regression model, guided by the escalation with overdose control principle, was implemented to make dose recommendations and estimate the maximum tolerated dose or recommended phase 2 dose of nazartinib (the primary outcome). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02108964); enrolment to phase 1 is complete and the study is ongoing.
Findings
By Aug 31, 2017, 180 patients (116 [64%] women; median age 60 years (52–69); 116 [64%] with ECOG performance status 1) received nazartinib across seven dose levels: 75 mg (n=17), 100 mg (n=38), 150 mg (n=73), 200 mg (n=8), 225 mg (n=28), 300 mg (n=5), and 350 mg (n=11). Seven dose-limiting toxicities were observed in six (3%) patients who received 150 mg, 225 mg, or 350 mg nazartinib once daily. Although the maximum tolerated dose was not met, the recommended phase 2 dose was declared as 150 mg once daily (tablet). The most common adverse events, regardless of cause, were rash (all subcategories 111 [62%] patients, maculopapular rash 72 [40%], dermatitis acneiform 22 [12%]), diarrhoea (81 [45%]), pruritus (70 [39%]), fatigue (54 [30%]), and stomatitis (54 [30%]), and were mostly grades 1–2. Any-cause grade 3–4 adverse events were reported in 99 (55%) patients across all doses, the most common being rash (all subcategories grouped 27 [15%]), pneumonia (12 [7%]), anaemia (ten [6%]), and dyspnoea (nine [5%]). Serious adverse events suspected to be drug-related occurred in 16 (9%) patients.
Interpretation
Nazartinib has a favourable safety profile, with low-grade skin toxicity characterised by a predominantly maculopapular rash that required minimal dose reductions.

Background
At present, no approved pharmacotherapies are available for unclassifiable interstitial lung disease (ILD), which is characterised by progressive fibrosis of the lung. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of pirfenidone in patients with progressive fibrosing unclassifiable ILD.
Methods
We did a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial at 70 centres in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and the UK. Eligible patients (aged ≥18–85 years) had progressive fibrosing unclassifiable ILD, a percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) of 45% or higher and percent predicted carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLco) of 30% or higher, more than 10% fibrosis on high-resolution CT, and a high-resolution CT from the previous 12 months. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to 2403 mg oral pirfenidone daily or placebo using a central validated interactive voice or web-based response system, stratified by concomitant mycophenolate mofetil use and presence or absence of interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features. Investigators, site personnel, and patients were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was mean predicted change in FVC from baseline over 24 weeks, measured by daily home spirometry. Secondary endpoints were change in FVC measured by site spirometry, proportion of patients who had a more than 5% or more than 10% absolute or relative decline in percent predicted FVC measured by clinic-based spirometry, change in percent predicted DLco, change in 6-min walk distance (6MWD), change in University of California San Diego-Shortness of Breath Questionnaire (UCSD-SOBQ) score, change in Leicester Cough Questionnaire score, change in cough visual analogue scale, and changes in total and subscores of the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), all of which were compared with baseline. Additional secondary endpoints included proportion of patients who had non-elective hospitalisation (respiratory and all-cause) and acute exacerbations, and progression-free survival. Efficacy was analysed in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, which included all randomly assigned patients. Safety was assessed in the safety analysis set, which included all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03099187, and is no longer recruiting.
Findings
Between May 15, 2017, and June 5, 2018, 253 patients were randomly assigned to receive 2403 mg pirfenidone (n=127) or placebo (n=126) and were included in the ITT analysis set. Analysis of the primary endpoint was affected by intraindividual variability in home spirometry values, which prevented application of the prespecified statistical model. Over 24 weeks, predicted median change in FVC measured by home spirometry was −87·7 mL (Q1–Q3 −338·1 to 148·6) in the pirfenidone group versus −157·1 mL (−370·9 to 70·1) in the placebo group. Over 24 weeks, predicted mean change in FVC measured by site spirometry was lower in patients given pirfenidone than placebo (treatment difference 95·3 mL [95% CI 35·9 to 154·6], p=0·002). Compared with the placebo group, patients in the pirfenidone group were less likely to have a decline in FVC of more than 5% (odds ratio [OR] 0·42 [95% CI 0·25 to 0·69], p=0·001) or more than 10% (OR 0·44 [0·23 to 0·84], p=0·011). At week 24, mean change in DLco from baseline was −0·7% (SD 7·1) for the pirfenidone group and −2·5% (8·8) for the placebo group, and mean change in 6MWD from baseline was −2·0 m (68·1) for the pirfenidone group and −26·7 m (79·3) for the placebo group. Changes from baseline in UCSD-SOBQ, Leicester Cough Questionnaire score, cough visual analogue scale, and SGRQ scores were similar between the pirfenidone and placebo groups at week 24. Analysis of acute exacerbations, hospital admissions, and time to death from respiratory causes during the study yielded no meaningful results due to a small number of events. No differences in progression-free survival were identified between the pirfenidone and placebo groups, irrespective of the definition of progression-free survival used. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 120 (94%) of 127 patients in the pirfenidone group and 101 (81%) of 124 patients in the placebo group. Serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 18 (14%) patients in the pirfenidone group and 20 (16%) patients in the placebo group. The most common treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events were gastrointestinal disorders (60 [47%] in the pirfenidone group vs 32 [26%] in the placebo group), fatigue (16 [13%] vs 12 [10%]), and rash (13 [10%] vs nine [7%]).
Interpretation
Although the planned statistical model could not be applied to the primary endpoint data, analysis of key secondary endpoints suggests that patients with progressive fibrosing unclassifiable ILD could benefit from pirfenidone treatment, which has an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. These findings support further investigation of pirfenidone as an effective treatment for patients with progressive fibrotic unclassifiable ILD.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Bronchiectasis guidelines recommend long-term macrolide treatment for patients with three or more exacerbations per year without Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Randomised controlled trials suggest that long-term macrolide treatment can prevent exacerbations in adult patients with bronchiectasis, but these individual studies have been too small to do meaningful subgroup analyses. We did a systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis to explore macrolide benefit in subpopulations, including those in which macrolide therapy is not currently recommended.
Methods
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science from Jan 1, 2000, to Sept 30, 2018, to identify double blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of macrolide antibiotics in adult patients with bronchiectasis. We applied no language restrictions. Randomised controlled trials were eligible if treatment was defined a priori as long term and had a primary or secondary outcome of bronchiectasis exacerbations. Studies in patients with cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis were excluded. The primary outcome of the meta-analysis was frequency of exacerbations requiring treatment with antibiotics. Secondary endpoints were time to first exacerbation, change in quality of life according to the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and change in FEV1. IPD meta-analysis was done using fixed effects models adjusting for age, sex, FEV1, and trial. We did prespecified subgroup analyses for each of the primary and secondary endpoints using one-step meta-analysis only. Subgroups were defined by age, sex, previous exacerbation frequency, smoking status, inhaled corticosteroid use at baseline, body-mass index at baseline, cause, C-reactive protein at baseline, baseline FEV1 percentage of predicted, SGRQ total score, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in sputum culture at baseline. The meta-analysis is registered with the PROSPERO international register of systematic reviews, number CRD42018102908.
Findings
Of 234 identified studies, we included three randomised controlled trials, and IPD was obtained for 341 participants. Macrolide antibiotics reduced the frequency of exacerbations (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0·49, 95% CI 0·36 to 0·66; p<0·0001). We also found that macrolide treatment improved the time to first exacerbation (adjusted hazard ratio 0·46, 0·34 to 0·61; p<0·0001) and was associated with improved quality of life measured by the SGRQ (mean improvement 2·93 points, 0·03 to 5·83; p=0·048). Macrolides were not associated with a significant improvement in FEV1 (67 mL at 1 year, −22 to 112; p=0·14). Effect estimates in prespecified subgroup analyses revealed a reduced frequency of exacerbations in all prespecified subgroups, including a high level of benefit in patients with P aeruginosa infection (IRR 0·36, 0·18–0·72; p=0·0044) and in patients with one to two exacerbations per year (0·37, 0·16–0·88; p=0·025). Studies were rated as low risk of bias across all domains.
Interpretation
Long-term macrolide treatment significantly reduces the frequency of exacerbations in patients with bronchiectasis, with similar benefits observed in all subgroups based on patient characteristics. This finding suggests that macrolides might be considered in patients in whom macrolides are not indicated according to the current guidelines, particularly if alternative approaches to reduce exacerbations have been unsuccessful. However, downsides of long-term macrolide treatment must also be taken into account.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Infection with influenza virus causes substantial morbidity and mortality globally, although antiviral treatments are available. Previous studies have suggested that anti-influenza immune plasma could be beneficial as treatment, but they were not designed as randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled trials. Therefore, we aimed to prospectively evaluate the clinical efficacy of high-titre immune plasma compared with standard low-titre plasma to improve outcomes in patients with severe influenza A infection.
Methods
We did this randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial at 41 US medical centres to assess the efficacy of high-titre anti-influenza plasma (haemagglutination inhibition antibody titre ≥1:80) compared with low-titre plasma (≤1:10). Children and adults with PCR-confirmed influenza A infection, a National Early Warning score of 3 or greater, and onset of illness within 6 days before randomisation were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) using an interactive web response system to receive either two units (or paediatric equivalent) of high-titre plasma (high-titre group) or low-titre plasma (low-titre group), and were followed up for 28 days from randomisation. High-titre and low-titre plasma had the same appearance. Randomisation was stratified by severity (in intensive care unit, not in intensive care but requiring supplemental oxygen, or not in intensive care and not requiring supplemental oxygen) and age (<18 years and ≥18 years). All participants, site staff, and the study team were masked to treatment allocation until after the final database lock. The primary endpoint was clinical status assessed by a six-point ordinal scale on day 7 (death, in intensive care, hospitalised but requiring supplemental oxygen, hospitalised not requiring supplemental oxygen, discharged but unable to resume normal activities, and discharged with full resumption of normal activities) analysed in a proportional odds model (an odds ratio [OR] >1 indicates improvement in clinical status across all categories for the high-titre vs the low-titre group). The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population, excluding two participants who did not receive plasma. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02572817.
Findings
Participants were recruited between Jan 26, 2016, and April 19, 2018. Of 200 participants enrolled (177 adults and 23 children), 140 met the criteria for randomisation and were assigned to the high-titre group (n=92) or to the control low-titre group (n=48). One participant from each group did not receive plasma. At baseline, 60 (43%) of 138 participants were in intensive care and 55 (71%) of 78 participants who were not in intensive care required oxygen. 93% of planned plasma infusions were completed. The study was terminated in July, 2018, when independent efficacy analysis showed low conditional power to detect an effect of high-titre plasma even if full accrual (150 participants) was achieved. The proportional OR for improved clinical status on day 7 was 1·22 (95% CI 0·65–2·29, p=0·54). 47 (34%) of 138 participants experienced 88 serious adverse events: 32 (35%) with 60 events in the high-titre group and 15 (32%) with 28 events in the low-titre group. The most common serious adverse events were acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; four [4%] vs two [4%]), allergic transfusion reactions (two [2%] vs two [4%]), and respiratory distress (three [3%] vs none). 65 (47%) participants experienced 183 adverse events: 42 (46%) with 126 events in the high-titre group and 23 (49%) with 57 events in the low-titre group. The most common adverse events were anaemia (four [3%] vs two [4%]) and ARDS (four [3%] vs three [5%]). Ten patients died during the study (six [7%] in the high-titre group vs four [9%] in the low-titre group, p=0·73). The most common cause of death was worsening of acute respiratory distress syndrome (two [2%] vs two [4%] patients).
Interpretation
High-titre anti-influenza plasma conferred no significant benefit over non-immune plasma. Although our study did not have the precision to rule out a small, clinically relevant effect, the benefit is insufficient to justify the use of immune plasma for treating patients with severe influenza A.

As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreads across the world, the intensive care unit (ICU) community must prepare for the challenges associated with this pandemic. Streamlining of workflows for rapid diagnosis and isolation, clinical management, and infection prevention will matter not only to patients with COVID-19, but also to health-care workers and other patients who are at risk from nosocomial transmission. Management of acute respiratory failure and haemodynamics is key. ICU practitioners, hospital administrators, governments, and policy makers must prepare for a substantial increase in critical care bed capacity, with a focus not just on infrastructure and supplies, but also on staff management. Critical care triage to allow the rationing of scarce ICU resources might be needed. Researchers must address unanswered questions, including the role of repurposed and experimental therapies.

Background
The INBUILD trial investigated the efficacy and safety of nintedanib versus placebo in patients with progressive fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) other than idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We aimed to establish the effects of nintedanib in subgroups based on ILD diagnosis.
Methods
The INBUILD trial was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial done at 153 sites in 15 countries. Participants had an investigator-diagnosed fibrosing ILD other than IPF, with chest imaging features of fibrosis of more than 10% extent on high resolution CT (HRCT), forced vital capacity (FVC) of 45% or more predicted, and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLco) of at least 30% and less than 80% predicted. Participants fulfilled protocol-defined criteria for ILD progression in the 24 months before screening, despite management considered appropriate in clinical practice for the individual ILD. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 by means of a pseudo-random number generator to receive nintedanib 150 mg twice daily or placebo for at least 52 weeks. Participants, investigators, and other personnel involved in the trial and analysis were masked to treatment assignment until after database lock. In this subgroup analysis, we assessed the rate of decline in FVC (mL/year) over 52 weeks in patients who received at least one dose of nintedanib or placebo in five prespecified subgroups based on the ILD diagnoses documented by the investigators: hypersensitivity pneumonitis, autoimmune ILDs, idiopathic non-specific interstitial pneumonia, unclassifiable idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, and other ILDs. The trial has been completed and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02999178.
Findings
Participants were recruited between Feb 23, 2017, and April 27, 2018. Of 663 participants who received at least one dose of nintedanib or placebo, 173 (26%) had chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, 170 (26%) an autoimmune ILD, 125 (19%) idiopathic non-specific interstitial pneumonia, 114 (17%) unclassifiable idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, and 81 (12%) other ILDs. The effect of nintedanib versus placebo on reducing the rate of FVC decline (mL/year) was consistent across the five subgroups by ILD diagnosis in the overall population (hypersensitivity pneumonitis 73·1 [95% CI −8·6 to 154·8]; autoimmune ILDs 104·0 [21·1 to 186·9]; idiopathic non-specific interstitial pneumonia 141·6 [46·0 to 237·2]; unclassifiable idiopathic interstitial pneumonia 68·3 [−31·4 to 168·1]; and other ILDs 197·1 [77·6 to 316·7]; p=0·41 for treatment by subgroup by time interaction). Adverse events reported in the subgroups were consistent with those reported in the overall population.
Interpretation
The INBUILD trial was not designed or powered to provide evidence for a benefit of nintedanib in specific diagnostic subgroups. However, its results suggest that nintedanib reduces the rate of ILD progression, as measured by FVC decline, in patients who have a chronic fibrosing ILD and progressive phenotype, irrespective of the underlying ILD diagnosis.

Background
Childhood asthma incidence is decreasing in some parts of Europe and North America. Antibiotic use in infancy has been associated with increased asthma risk. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that decreases in asthma incidence are linked to reduced antibiotic prescribing and mediated by changes in the gut bacterial community.
Methods
This study comprised population-based and prospective cohort analyses. At the population level, we used administrative data from British Columbia, Canada (population 4·7 million), on annual rates of antibiotic prescriptions and asthma diagnoses, to assess the association between antibiotic prescribing (at age <1 year) and asthma incidence (at age 1–4 years). At the individual level, 2644 children from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) prospective birth cohort were examined for the association of systemic antibiotic use (at age <1 year) with the diagnosis of asthma (at age 5 years). In the same cohort, we did a mechanistic investigation of 917 children with available 16S rRNA gene sequencing data from faecal samples (at age ≤1 year), to assess how composition of the gut microbiota relates to antibiotic exposure and asthma incidence.
Findings
At the population level between 2000 and 2014, asthma incidence in children (aged 1–4 years) showed an absolute decrease of 7·1 new diagnoses per 1000 children, from 27·3 (26·8–28·3) per 1000 children to 20·2 (19·5–20·8) per 1000 children (a relative decrease of 26·0%). Reduction in incidence over the study period was associated with decreasing antibiotic use in infancy (age <1 year), from 1253·8 prescriptions (95% CI 1219·3–1288·9) per 1000 infants to 489·1 (467·6–511·2) per 1000 infants (Spearman's r=0·81; p<0·0001). Asthma incidence increased by 24% with each 10% increase in antibiotic prescribing (adjusted incidence rate ratio 1·24 [95% CI 1·20–1·28]; p<0·0001). In the CHILD cohort, after excluding children who received antibiotics for respiratory symptoms, asthma diagnosis in childhood was associated with infant antibiotic use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2·15 [95% CI 1·37–3·39]; p=0·0009), with a significant dose–response; 114 (5·2%) of 2182 children unexposed to antibiotics had asthma by age 5 years, compared with 23 (8·1%) of 284 exposed to one course, five (10·2%) of 49 exposed to two courses, and six (17·6%) of 34 exposed to three or more courses (aOR 1·44 [1·16–1·79]; p=0·0008). Increasing α-diversity of the gut microbiota, defined as an IQR increase (25th to 75th percentile) in the Chao1 index, at age 1 year was associated with a 32% reduced risk of asthma at age 5 years (aOR for IQR increase 0·68 [0·46–0·99]; p=0·046). In a structural equation model, we found the gut microbiota at age 1 year, characterised by α-diversity, β-diversity, and amplicon sequence variants modified by antibiotic exposure, to be a significant mediator between outpatient antibiotic exposure in the first year of life and asthma diagnosis at age 5 years (β=0·08; p=0·027).
Interpretation
Our findings suggest that the reduction in the incidence of paediatric asthma observed in recent years might be an unexpected benefit of prudent antibiotic use during infancy, acting via preservation of the gut microbial community.

abstract = "Summary
Critical illness is associated with immune dysregulation, characterised by concurrent hyperinflammation and immune suppression. Hyperinflammation can result in collateral tissue damage and organ failure, whereas immune suppression has been implicated in susceptibility to secondary infections and reactivation of latent viruses. Macrolides are a class of bacteriostatic antibiotics that are used in the intensive care unit to control infections or to alleviate gastrointestinal dysmotility. Yet macrolides also have potent and wide-ranging immunomodulatory properties, which might have the potential to correct immune dysregulation in patients who are critically ill without affecting crucial antimicrobial defences. In this Review, we provide an overview of preclinical and clinical studies that point to the beneficial effects of macrolides in acute diseases relevant to critical care, and we discuss the possible underlying mechanisms of their immunomodulatory effects. Further studies are needed to explore the therapeutic potential of macrolides in critical illness, to identify subgroups of patients who might benefit from treatment, and to develop novel non-antibiotic macrolide derivatives with improved immunomodulatory properties."

abstract = "Summary
Global health care is experiencing an unprecedented surge in the number of critically ill patients who require mechanical ventilation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The requirement for relatively long periods of ventilation in those who survive means that many are considered for tracheostomy to free patients from ventilatory support and maximise scarce resources. COVID-19 provides unique challenges for tracheostomy care: health-care workers need to safely undertake tracheostomy procedures and manage patients afterwards, minimising risks of nosocomial transmission and compromises in the quality of care. Conflicting recommendations exist about case selection, the timing and performance of tracheostomy, and the subsequent management of patients. In response, we convened an international working group of individuals with relevant expertise in tracheostomy. We did a literature and internet search for reports of research pertaining to tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic, supplemented by sources comprising statements and guidance on tracheostomy care. By synthesising early experiences from countries that have managed a surge in patient numbers, emerging virological data, and international, multidisciplinary expert opinion, we aim to provide consensus guidelines and recommendations on the conduct and management of tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic."

abstract = "Summary
The global pandemic of COVID-19 has been associated with infections and deaths among health-care workers. This Viewpoint of infectious aerosols is intended to inform appropriate infection control measures to protect health-care workers. Studies of cough aerosols and of exhaled breath from patients with various respiratory infections have shown striking similarities in aerosol size distributions, with a predominance of pathogens in small particles (<5 μm). These are immediately respirable, suggesting the need for personal respiratory protection (respirators) for individuals in close proximity to patients with potentially virulent pathogens. There is no evidence that some pathogens are carried only in large droplets. Surgical masks might offer some respiratory protection from inhalation of infectious aerosols, but not as much as respirators. However, surgical masks worn by patients reduce exposures to infectious aerosols to health-care workers and other individuals. The variability of infectious aerosol production, with some so-called super-emitters producing much higher amounts of infectious aerosol than most, might help to explain the epidemiology of super-spreading. Airborne infection control measures are indicated for potentially lethal respiratory pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Previous attempts to characterise the burden of chronic respiratory diseases have focused only on specific disease conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma. In this study, we aimed to characterise the burden of chronic respiratory diseases globally, providing a comprehensive and up-to-date analysis on geographical and time trends from 1990 to 2017.
Methods
Using data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017, we estimated the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality attributable to chronic respiratory diseases through an analysis of deaths, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and years of life lost (YLL) by GBD super-region, from 1990 to 2017, stratified by age and sex. Specific diseases analysed included asthma, COPD, interstitial lung disease and pulmonary sarcoidosis, pneumoconiosis, and other chronic respiratory diseases. We also assessed the contribution of risk factors (smoking, second-hand smoke, ambient particulate matter and ozone pollution, household air pollution from solid fuels, and occupational risks) to chronic respiratory disease-attributable DALYs.
Findings
In 2017, 544·9 million people (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 506·9–584·8) worldwide had a chronic respiratory disease, representing an increase of 39·8% compared with 1990. Chronic respiratory disease prevalence showed wide variability across GBD super-regions, with the highest prevalence among both males and females in high-income regions, and the lowest prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. The age-sex-specific prevalence of each chronic respiratory disease in 2017 was also highly variable geographically. Chronic respiratory diseases were the third leading cause of death in 2017 (7·0% [95% UI 6·8–7·2] of all deaths), behind cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms. Deaths due to chronic respiratory diseases numbered 3 914 196 (95% UI 3 790 578–4 044 819) in 2017, an increase of 18·0% since 1990, while total DALYs increased by 13·3%. However, when accounting for ageing and population growth, declines were observed in age-standardised prevalence (14·3% decrease), age-standardised death rates (42·6%), and age-standardised DALY rates (38·2%). In males and females, most chronic respiratory disease-attributable deaths and DALYs were due to COPD. In regional analyses, mortality rates from chronic respiratory diseases were greatest in south Asia and lowest in sub-Saharan Africa, also across both sexes. Notably, although absolute prevalence was lower in south Asia than in most other super-regions, YLLs due to chronic respiratory diseases across the subcontinent were the highest in the world. Death rates due to interstitial lung disease and pulmonary sarcoidosis were greater than those due to pneumoconiosis in all super-regions. Smoking was the leading risk factor for chronic respiratory disease-related disability across all regions for men. Among women, household air pollution from solid fuels was the predominant risk factor for chronic respiratory diseases in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, while ambient particulate matter represented the leading risk factor in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania, and in the Middle East and north Africa super-region.
Interpretation
Our study shows that chronic respiratory diseases remain a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, with growth in absolute numbers but sharp declines in several age-standardised estimators since 1990. Premature mortality from chronic respiratory diseases seems to be highest in regions with less-resourced health systems on a per-capita basis.

Background
Benralizumab did not significantly reduce exacerbations compared with placebo in the phase 3 GALATHEA and TERRANOVA trials of benralizumab for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We aimed to identify clinical and physiological characteristics of patients with COPD that could help to identify people who are likely to have the greatest treatment effect with benralizumab.
Methods
We analysed individual study and pooled results from GALATHEA and TERRANOVA. At study enrolment, patients from GALATHEA and TERRANOVA were aged 40–85 years, had moderate to very severe airflow limitation, had elevated blood eosinophil counts, and at least two exacerbations or one severe exacerbation in the previous year despite dual inhaled therapy (inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting β2-agonists or long-acting β2-agonists plus long-acting muscarinic antagonists) or triple inhaled therapy (inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting β2-agonists plus long-acting muscarinic antagonists). We analysed data for 3910 patients who received benralizumab (30 mg or 100 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks; first three doses every 4 weeks) or placebo with dual or triple therapy to identify factors consistently associated with annual exacerbation rate reduction. We evaluated the annual exacerbation rate for benralizumab versus placebo as the primary endpoint. GALATHEA and TERRANOVA are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02138916 and NCT02155660, respectively.
Findings
For 2665 patients with elevated blood eosinophil counts, treatment effect with benralizumab every 8 weeks at 100 mg, but not at 30 mg, occurred for patients with a history of more frequent exacerbations, poorer baseline lung function, or greater baseline lung function improvement with short-acting bronchodilators. Patients with baseline blood eosinophil counts of 220 cells per μL or greater with: three or more exacerbations in the previous year receiving benralizumab every 8 weeks versus placebo, had rate ratios (RRs) of 0·69 (95% CI 0·56–0·83) for 100 mg and 0·86 (0·71–1·04) for 30 mg; postbronchodilator FEV1 of less than 40% had RRs of 0·76 (0·64–0·91) for 100 mg and 0·90 (0·76–1·06) for 30 mg; and postbronchodilator response of at least 15% had RRs of 0·67 (0·54–0·83) for 100 mg and 0·87 (0·71–1·07) for 30 mg. When combined factors were examined, patients with elevated baseline blood eosinophil counts, with three or more exacerbations in the previous year, and who were receiving triple therapy were identified as likely to benefit from benralizumab 100 mg every 8 weeks versus placebo (RR 0·70 [95% CI 0·56–0·88]). Benralizumab 30 mg every 8 weeks did not benefit patients meeting these criteria compared with placebo (RR 0·99 [95% CI 0·79–1·23]).
Interpretation
Elevated blood eosinophil counts combined with clinical characteristics identified a subpopulation of patients with COPD who had reductions in exacerbations with benralizumab treatment. These hypothesis-generating analyses identified the potential efficacy of benralizumab 100 mg for this subpopulation. These findings require prospective evaluation in clinical trials.

abstract = "Summary
WHO interim guidelines recommend offering extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to eligible patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The number of patients with COVID-19 infection who might develop severe ARDS that is refractory to maximal medical management and require this level of support is currently unknown. Available evidence from similar patient populations suggests that carefully selected patients with severe ARDS who do not benefit from conventional treatment might be successfully supported with venovenous ECMO. The need for ECMO is relatively low and its use is mostly restricted to specialised centres globally. Providing complex therapies such as ECMO during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases has unique challenges. Careful planning, judicious resource allocation, and training of personnel to provide complex therapeutic interventions while adhering to strict infection control measures are all crucial components of an ECMO action plan. ECMO can be initiated in specialist centres, or patients can receive ECMO during transportation from a centre that is not specialised for this procedure to an expert ECMO centre. Ensuring that systems enable safe and coordinated movement of critically ill patients, staff, and equipment is important to improve ECMO access. ECMO preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic is important in view of the high transmission rate of the virus and respiratory-related mortality."

Background
New anti-tuberculosis regimens that are shorter, simpler, and less toxic than those that are currently available are needed as part of the global effort to address the tuberculosis epidemic. We aimed to investigate the bactericidal activity and safety profile of combinations of bedaquiline, pretomanid, moxifloxacin, and pyrazinamide in the first 8 weeks of treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis.
Methods
In this multicentre, open-label, partially randomised, phase 2b trial, we prospectively recruited patients with drug-susceptible or rifampicin-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis from seven sites in South Africa, two in Tanzania, and one in Uganda. Patients aged 18 years or older with sputum smear grade 1+ or higher were eligible for enrolment, and a molecular assay (GeneXpert or MTBDRplus) was used to confirm the diagnosis of tuberculosis and to distinguish between drug-susceptible and rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis. Patients who were HIV positive with a baseline CD4 cell count of less than 100 cells per uL were excluded. Patients with drug-susceptible tuberculosis were randomly assigned (1:1:1) using numbered treatment packs with sequential allocation by the pharmacist to receive 56 days of treatment with standard tuberculosis therapy (oral isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol; HRZE), or pretomanid (oral 200 mg daily) and pyrazinamide (oral 1500 mg daily) with either oral bedaquiline 400 mg daily on days 1–14 then 200 mg three times per week (BloadPaZ) or oral bedaquiline 200 mg daily (B200PaZ). Patients with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis received 56 days of the B200PaZ regimen plus moxifloxacin 400 mg daily (BPaMZ). All treatment groups were open label, and randomisation was not stratified. Patients, trial investigators and staff, pharmacists or dispensers, laboratory staff (with the exception of the mycobacteriology laboratory staff), sponsor staff, and applicable contract research organisations were not masked. The primary efficacy outcome was daily percentage change in time to sputum culture positivity (TTP) in liquid medium over days 0–56 in the drug-susceptible tuberculosis population, based on non-linear mixed-effects regression modelling of log10 (TTP) over time. The efficacy analysis population contained patients who received at least one dose of medication and who had efficacy data available and had no major protocol violations. The safety population contained patients who received at least one dose of medication. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02193776, and all patients have completed follow-up.
Findings
Between Oct 24, 2014, and Dec 15, 2015, we enrolled 180 patients with drug-susceptible tuberculosis (59 were randomly assigned to BloadPaZ, 60 to B200PaZ, and 61 to HRZE) and 60 patients with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis. 57 patients in the BloadPaZ group, 56 in the B200PaZ group, and 59 in the HRZE group were included in the primary analysis. B200PaZ produced the highest daily percentage change in TTP (5·17% [95% Bayesian credibility interval 4·61–5·77]), followed by BloadPaZ (4·87% [4·31–5·47]) and HRZE group (4·04% [3·67–4·42]). The bactericidal activity in B200PaZ and BloadPaZ groups versus that in the HRZE group was significantly different. Higher proportions of patients in the BloadPaZ (six [10%] of 59) and B200PaZ (five [8%] of 60) groups discontinued the study drug than in the HRZE group (two [3%] of 61) because of adverse events. Liver enzyme elevations were the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events and resulted in the withdrawal of ten patients (five [8%] in the BloadPaZ group, three [5%] in the B200PaZ group, and two [3%] in the HRZE group). Serious treatment-related adverse events affected two (3%) patients in the BloadPaZ group and one (2%) patient in the HRZE group. Seven (4%) patients with drug-susceptible tuberculosis died and four (7%) patients with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis died. None of the deaths were considered to be related to treatment.
Interpretation
B200PaZ is a promising regimen to treat patients with drug-susceptible tuberculosis. The bactericidal activity of both these regimens suggests that they have the potential to shorten treatment, and the simplified dosing schedule of B200PaZ could improve treatment adherence in the field. However, these findings must be investigated further in a phase 3 trial assessing treatment outcomes.

Background
Combination nicotine replacement therapy shows additive cessation benefits. We aimed to find out the effectiveness of combining nicotine patches with an e-cigarette (with and without nicotine) on six-month smoking abstinence.
Methods
We did a pragmatic, three-arm, parallel-group trial in New Zealand in adult smokers who were e-cigarette naive and motivated to quit smoking. Participants were recruited from the general population using national media advertising. Participants were randomly assigned (1:4:4), with the use of stratified block randomisation, to receive 14 weeks (2 weeks before the agreed quit date) of 21 mg, 24h nicotine patches, patches plus an 18 mg/L nicotine e-cigarette, or patches plus a nicotine-free e-cigarette. We advised participants to use one patch daily, with e-cigarette use as and when necessary or desired. Participants and researchers were masked to e-liquid nicotine content. We offered 6 weeks of telephone-delivered behavioural support. The primary outcome was exhaled carbon monoxide (CO)-verified continuous smoking abstinence 6 months after the agreed quit date. Primary analysis was by intention to treat, with sensitivity analysis by per protocol, treatment adherence, varying CO cutoffs, and complete case analysis. This paper presents the main analyses and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02521662.
Findings
Between March 17, 2016 and Nov 30, 2017, 1124 people were assigned to nicotine patches (patches only group, n=125), patches plus a nicotine e-cigarette (patches plus nicotine e-cigarette group, n=500), or patches plus a nicotine-free e-cigarette (patches plus nicotine-free e-cigarette group, n=499). 62 (50%) of 125 participants in the patches only group withdrew or were lost to follow-up by 6 months compared with 161 (32%) of 500 in the patches plus nicotine e-cigarette group and 162 (33%) of 499 in the patches plus nicotine-free e-cigarette group. 35 (7%) participants in the patches plus nicotine e-cigarette group had CO-verified continuous abstinence at 6 months compared with 20 (4%) in the patches plus nicotine-free e-cigarette group (risk difference [RD] 2·99 [95% CI 0·17–5·81]), and three (2%) people in the patches only group (RD 4·60 [1·11–8·09]). 18 serious adverse events occurred in 16 people in the patches plus nicotine e-cigarette group compared with 27 events in 22 people in the patches plus nicotine-free e-cigarette group and four events in three people in the patches only group. In the patches plus nicotine e-cigarette group, two life-threatening serious adverse events were reported (two separate heart attacks in the one participant). In the patches plus nicotine-free e-cigarette group, one death occurred (accidental drug overdose) and one life-threatening serious adverse event (heart attack). No significant between-group differences were noted for serious adverse events, and none were treatment-related.
Interpretation
Combining reduced-harm nicotine products, such as nicotine patches with a nicotine e-cigarette, can lead to a modest improvement in smoking cessation over and above that obtained from using patches plus a nicotine-free e-cigarette (or patches alone), with no indication of any serious harm in the short-term. Future e-cigarette trials should focus on their use alone or in combination with usual smoking cessation support, given issues with differential loss to follow-up and withdrawal if a usual care group is used as a comparator.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Fluid resuscitation is the recommended management of shock, but increased mortality in febrile African children in the FEAST trial. We hypothesised that fluid bolus-induced deaths in FEAST would be associated with detectable changes in cardiovascular, neurological, or respiratory function, oxygen carrying capacity, and blood biochemistry.
Methods
We developed composite scores for respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological function using vital sign data from the FEAST trial, and used them to compare participants from FEAST with those from four other cohorts and to identify differences between the bolus (n=2097) and no bolus (n=1044) groups of FEAST. We calculated the odds of adverse outcome for each ten-unit increase in baseline score using logistic regression for each cohort. Within FEAST participants, we also compared haemoglobin and plasma biochemistry between bolus and non-bolus patients, assessed the effects of these factors along with the vital sign scores on the contribution of bolus to mortality using Cox proportional hazard models, and used Bayesian clustering to identify subgroups that differed in response to bolus. The FEAST trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN69856593.
Findings
Increasing respiratory (odds ratio 1·09, 95% CI 1·07–1·11), neurological (1·26, 1·21–1·31), and cardiovascular scores (1·09, 1·05–1·14) were associated with death in FEAST (all p<0·0001), and with adverse outcomes for specific scores in the four other cohorts. In FEAST, fluid bolus increased respiratory and neurological scores and decreased cardiovascular score at 1 h after commencement of the infusion. Fluid bolus recipients had mean 0·33 g/dL (95% CI 0·20–0·46) reduction in haemoglobin concentration after 8 h (p<0·0001), and at 24 h had a decrease of 1·41 mEq/L (95% CI 0·76–2·06; p=0·0002) in mean base excess and increase of 1·65 mmol/L (0·47–2·8; p=0·0070) in mean chloride, and a decrease of 0·96 mmol/L (0·45 to 1·47; p=0·0003) in bicarbonate. There were similar effects of fluid bolus in three patient subgroups, identified on the basis of their baseline characteristics. Hyperchloraemic acidosis and respiratory and neurological dysfunction induced by saline or albumin bolus explained the excess mortality due to bolus in Cox survival models.
Interpretation
In the resuscitation of febrile children, albumin and saline boluses can cause respiratory and neurological dysfunction, hyperchloraemic acidosis, and reduction in haemoglobin concentration. The findings support the notion that fluid resuscitation with unbuffered electrolyte solutions may cause harm and their use should be cautioned. The effects of lower volumes of buffered solutions should be evaluated further.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Existing normal polysomnography values are not truly normative as they are based on small sample sizes due to the fact that polysomnography is expensive and burdensome to obtain. There is a clear need for a large sample of truly normative data for clinical management and research. This study is a comprehensive meta-analysis of adult polysomnography parameters scored using recent criteria and establishes normative values adjusted for age and sex.
Methods
For this meta-analysis of adult polysomnography parameters, we searched Scopus for studies of any design published between Jan 1, 2007, and July 31, 2016, that reported polysomnographic parameters scored using recent American Academy of Sleep Medicine criteria (2007 or 2012) collected during an overnight level 1 in-laboratory sleep study in healthy controls. We excluded studies of patients with conditions or subjected to treatments that might affect sleep and studies not available in English. Study endpoints were the pooled estimates of 14 reported polysomnographic parameters. Estimates for each parameter were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis. The influence of age and sex was ascertained using multivariate mixed-effects meta-regressions. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017074319.
Findings
Of 3712 articles, 169 studies, comprising 5273 participants, were eligible for inclusion. We report normative data stratified by age and sex. For each decade of age, total sleep time decreased by 10·1 min (95% CI 7·5 to 12·8), sleep efficiency decreased by 2·1% (1·5 to 2·6), wake after sleep onset increased by 9·7 min (6·9 to 12·4), sleep onset latency increased by 1·1 min (0·3 to 1·9), arousal index increased by 2·1 events per h (1·5 to 2·6), percentage of N1 sleep increased by 0·5% (0·1 to 0·8), apnea–hypopnea index increased by 1·2 events per h (0·9 to 1·4), mean oxygen saturation decreased by 0·6% (0·5 to 0·7), minimum oxygen saturation decreased by 1·8% (1·3 to 2·3), and periodic limb movement index increased by 1·2 events per h (0·8 to 1·6). Changes with age in the percentage of N2 sleep (0·0%, 95% CI −0·1 to 0·1), N3 sleep (−0·1%, −0·1 to 0·0), and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (0·0%, −0·1 to 0·0) were not significant. Every 10% increase in the percentage of male participants was associated with reduced REM latency (0·9 min decrease, 95% CI 0·1 to 1·6) and mean oxygen saturation (0·1% decrease, 0·0 to 0·1), and greater arousal index (0·3 events per h, 0·0 to 0·5) and apnea–hypopnea index (0·2 events per h, 0·1 to 0·3).
Interpretation
These normative values serve as a useful control reference for clinicians and for future research where it might be difficult to obtain polysomnographic controls. The resulting normative trends by age and sex might also be hypothesis-generating for a broad range of investigations.

Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a heterogeneous and complex disease; however, diagnosis and management still rely on a simple set of tools and few therapeutic options. Precision medicine has emerged as the next goal for clinical practice, with the objective being to offer individually tailored treatments. Ways of implementing precision medicine in clinical practice have emerged for various respiratory disorders, and such an approach could also be readily exported to OSA. Here, we propose a control panel tool that describes OSA in four domains: disease severity, biological activity, impact on the patient, and pathophysiological traits. We also propose a graphical instrument, the clinical fingerprint tool, to enable the tracking of patients over time. These tools can address the complexity of OSA and guide a physician's course of action on the basis of the treatable traits of an individual patient, thereby facilitating clinical implementation of precision medicine in the disorder."

abstract = "Summary
The diverse microbial communities within our bodies produce metabolites that modulate host immune responses. Even the microbiome at distal sites has an important function in respiratory health. However, the clinical importance of the microbiome in tuberculosis, the biggest infectious cause of death worldwide, is only starting to be understood. Here, we critically review research on the microbiome's association with pulmonary tuberculosis. The research indicates five main points: (1) susceptibility to infection and progression to active tuberculosis is altered by gut Helicobacter co-infection, (2) aerosol Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection changes the gut microbiota, (3) oral anaerobes in the lung make metabolites that decrease pulmonary immunity and predict progression, (4) the increased susceptibility to reinfection of patients who have previously been treated for tuberculosis is likely due to the depletion of T-cell epitopes on commensal gut non-tuberculosis mycobacteria, and (5) the prolonged antibiotic treatment required for cure of tuberculosis has long-term detrimental effects on the microbiome. We highlight knowledge gaps, considerations for addressing these knowledge gaps, and describe potential targets for modifying the microbiome to control tuberculosis."

abstract = "Summary
For patients with chronic, life-limiting illnesses, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) near the end of life might not improve patient outcomes or be consistent with patient and family values, goals, and preferences. In this context, advance care planning and palliative care interventions designed to clarify patients' values, goals, and preferences have the potential to reduce provision of high-intensity interventions that are unwanted or non-beneficial. In this Series paper, we have assessed interventions that are effective at helping patients with chronic, life-limiting illnesses to avoid an unwanted ICU admission. The evidence found was largely from observational studies, with considerable heterogeneity in populations, methods, and types of interventions. Results from randomised trials of interventions to improve communication about goals of care are scarce, of variable quality, and mixed. Although observational studies show that advance care planning and palliative care interventions are associated with a reduced number of ICU admissions at the end of life, causality has not been well established. Using the available evidence we suggest recommendations to help to avoid ICU admission when it does not align with patient and family values, goals, and preferences and conclude with future directions for research."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Nintedanib targets VEGF receptors 1–3, PDGF receptors α and β, FGF receptors 1–3, and Src and Abl kinases, which are all implicated in malignant pleural mesothelioma pathogenesis. Here, we report the final results of the phase 3 part of the LUME-Meso trial, which aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of pemetrexed plus cisplatin combined with nintedanib or placebo in unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma.
Methods
This double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial was done at 120 academic medical centres and community clinics in 27 countries across the world. Chemotherapy-naive adults (aged ≥18 years) with unresectable epithelioid malignant pleural mesothelioma and ECOG performance status 0–1 were randomly assigned 1:1 via an independently verified random number-generating system to receive up to six 21-day cycles of pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) plus cisplatin (75 mg/m2) on day 1, then nintedanib (200 mg twice daily) or matched placebo on days 2–21. Patients without disease progression after six cycles received nintedanib or placebo maintenance on days 1–21 of each cycle. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (investigator-assessed according to mRECIST) in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of their assigned study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01907100.
Findings
Between April 14, 2016, and Jan 5, 2018, 541 patients were screened and 458 were randomly assigned to either the nintedanib group (n=229) or the placebo group (n=229). Median treatment duration was 5·3 months (IQR 2·8–7·3) in the nintedanib group and 5·1 months (2·7–7·8) in the placebo group. After 250 events, progression-free survival was not different between the nintedanib group (median 6·8 months [95% CI 6·1–7·0]) and the placebo group (7·0 months [6·7–7·2]; HR 1·01 [95% CI 0·79–1·30], p=0·91). The most frequently reported grade 3 or worse adverse event in both treatment groups was neutropenia (73 [32%] in the nintedanib group vs 54 [24%] in the placebo group). Serious adverse events were reported in 99 (44%) patients in the nintedanib group and 89 (39%) patients in the placebo group. The only serious adverse event occurring in at least 5% of patients in either group was pulmonary embolism (13 [6%] vs seven [3%]).
Interpretation
The primary progression-free survival endpoint of the phase 3 part of LUME-Meso was not met and phase 2 findings were not confirmed. No unexpected safety findings were reported.

Background
The anti-programmed death 1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab has shown antitumour activity and is a first-line and second-line treatment option for patients with programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-expressing advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. We report updated 3-year safety and efficacy outcomes from the phase 1 study, KEYNOTE-001.
Methods
KEYNOTE-001 is a multicohort, open-label, phase 1 study of pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks) in treatment naive or previously treated patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with measurable disease at baseline. Two cohorts were randomly assigned to a pembrolizumab dose by use of a computer-generated randomisation schedule at cohort-dependent ratios, and a further four cohorts were assigned to a pembrolizumab dose without randomisation. We present 3-year outcomes for the full analysis set of patients who received at least one dose of study treatment, pooled for all pembrolizumab doses. The primary efficacy endpoint was proportion of patients with objective response, analysed here as investigator-assessed response according to immune-related response criteria. Secondary efficacy endpoints included overall survival, duration of response, and progression-free survival. Safety endpoints included incidence of adverse events. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01295827, and is ongoing.
Findings
Between May 8, 2012 and July 13, 2014, 550 patients (101 treatment naive and 449 previously treated) were enrolled. Median follow-up was 34·5 months at data cutoff (Sept 1, 2016). At 36 months, investigator-assessed objective response according to immune-related response criteria was achieved for 41 of 101 treatment naive patients (41% [95% CI 30·9–50·8]; median duration of response was 16·7 months [95% CI 12·6–not reached]) and 102 of 449 previously treated patients (23% [18·9–26·9]; 33·3 ([22·5–not reached]). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of overall survival at 36 months was 26·4% (95% CI 14·3–40·1) for treatment naive patients and 19·0% (15·0–23·4) for previously treated patients, with median overall survival of 22·3 months (95% CI 17·1–31·5) and 10·5 months (8·6–13·2). PD-L1 tumour proportion score ≥50% was associated with longer median overall survival (95% CI) versus tumour proportion score 1–49% (treatment naive: 34·9 [20·3–not reached] vs 19·5 [10·7–26·3] months; previously treated: 15·4 [10·5–18·5] vs 8·5 [6·0–12·7] months). Grade 3–5 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 66 patients (12%), and 30 (6%) discontinued owing to a treatment-related adverse event. The most frequent grade 3–4 treatment-related adverse events were pneumonitis (10 [2%] of 550) and fatigue (5 [1%] of 550). Overall, 227 patients (41%) of 550 had serious adverse events, of which 50 (9%) were treatment related.
Interpretation
Pembrolizumab provides durable response and long-term effects on overall survival, with tolerable safety, for treatment naive and previously treated patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer expressing PD-L1.

abstract = "Summary
Tuberculosis is a major cause of death and disability among children globally, yet children have been neglected in global tuberculosis control efforts. Historically, tuberculosis in children has been thought of as a family disease, and because of this, household contact tracing of children after identification of an adult tuberculosis case has been emphasised as the principal public health intervention. However, the population-level effect of household contact tracing is predicated on the assumption that most paediatric tuberculosis infections are acquired within the household. In this Personal View, we focus on accumulating scientific evidence indicating that the majority of Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission to children in high-burden settings occurs in the community, outside of households in which a person has tuberculosis. We estimate the population-attributable fraction of M tuberculosis transmission to children due to household exposures to be between 10% and 30%. M tuberculosis transmission from the household was low (<30%) even in children younger than age 5 years. We propose that an effective public health response to childhood tuberculosis requires comprehensive, community-based interventions, such as active surveillance in select settings, rather than contact tracing alone. Importantly, the historical paradigm that most paediatric transmission occurs in households should be reconsidered on the basis of the scientific knowledge presented."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Inherited mutations in SERPINA1 coding for the alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) protein is the only well established cause of hereditary emphysema. We aimed to identify the genetic ecause of early-onset emphysema in a five-generation French-Canadian family free of A1AT deficiency.
Methods
Between Dec 1, 2014, and April 1, 2017, we investigated 63 individuals from a single pedigree, including 55 with DNA available. Whole-exome sequencing was done in a convenience sample of 14 individuals (nine with unambiguous expression of the typical form of emphysema observed in this family). We filtered rare non-synonymous variants that were predicted to be damaging to identify a single mutation in a biologically relevant gene shared among all affected individuals. We assessed segregation with the disease in additional family members who were not evaluated by whole-exome sequencing. The effect of the candidate variant on protein function was evaluated in vitro. mRNA and protein expression of the candidate gene was assessed in lung samples from unrelated individuals (n=80) with and without emphysema who underwent surgery for lung cancer at our institution.
Findings
A rare in-silico-predicted damaging variant (Ala455Thr) was identified in the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 6 (PTPN6) gene, also known as SHP-1, an important negative regulator of immune processes. 20 (95%) of 21 family members with computed tomography-confirmed emphysema were heterozygotes for the Ala455Thr mutation. No Thr455 homozygotes were identified. Emphysema or reduced diffusion capacity was observed in all heterozygotes with a history of smoking. Incomplete penetrance of the mutation and variable degrees of emphysema were observed in never smokers. The Ala455Thr mutation in SHP-1 caused a reduction in phosphatase activity in vitro, confirming the loss-of-function effect of the mutation. mRNA and protein expression of PTPN6 were upregulated in smokers, but were not associated with emphysema or severity of airflow limitation.
Interpretation
An inherited variant in the gene PTPN6 is responsible for early-onset emphysema in this family. To our knowledge, this is the second form of hereditary emphysema since the discovery of A1AT deficiency in the 1960s, representing a breakthrough in understanding the genetics and pathogenesis of emphysema.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The IMpower150 trial showed significant improvements in progression-free and overall survival with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab plus carboplatin plus paclitaxel (ABCP) versus the standard-of-care bevacizumab plus carboplatin plus paclitaxel (BCP) in chemotherapy-naive patients with non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. Here, we report the efficacy of ABCP or atezolizumab plus carboplatin plus paclitaxel (ACP) versus BCP in key patient subgroups.
Methods
IMpower150 was a randomised, open-label, phase 3 study done at 240 academic medical centres and community oncology practices across 26 countries worldwide. Patients with chemotherapy-naive metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive ABCP, ACP, or BCP every three weeks. The co-primary endpoints were overall survival and investigator-assessed progression-free survival in intention-to-treat wild-type patients (patients with epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] or anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK] genetic alterations were excluded). Efficacy was assessed in key subgroups within the intention-to-treat population, including patients with EGFR mutations (both sensitising and non-sensitising; EGFR-positive) previously treated with one or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors and patients with baseline liver metastases. Overall survival in the intention-to-treat population was included among secondary efficacy endpoints. Exploratory endpoints included the proportion of patients achieving an objective response in the intention-to-treat population, including EGFR-positive patients and patients with baseline liver metastases. Data are reported as per the Jan 22, 2018, data cutoff date, at which the number of coprimary prespecified overall survival events was met in the ABCP versus BCP groups. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02366143, and is ongoing.
Findings
Between March 31, 2015, and Dec 30, 2016, 1202 patients were enrolled. 400 patients were randomly assigned to ABCP, 402 to ACP, and 400 to BCP. In EGFR-positive patients (124 of 1202), median overall survival was not estimable (NE; 95% CI 17·0–NE) with ABCP (34 of 400) and 18·7 months (95% CI 13·4–NE) with BCP (45 of 400; hazard ratio [HR] 0·61 [95% CI 0·29–1·28]). Improved overall survival with ABCP versus BCP was observed in patients with sensitising EGFR mutations (median overall survival NE [95% CI NE–NE] with ABCP [26 of 400] vs 17·5 months [95% CI 11·7–NE] with BCP [32 of 400]; HR 0·31 [95% CI 0·11–0·83]) and in the intention-to-treat population (19·8 months [17·4–24·2] vs 14·9 months [13·4–17·1]; HR 0·76 [0·63–0·93]). Improved median overall survival with ABCP versus BCP was seen in patients with baseline liver metastases (13·3 months [11·6–NE] with ABCP [52 of 400] vs 9·4 months [7·9–11·7] with BCP [57 of 400]; HR 0·52 [0·33–0·82]). Median overall survival was 21·4 months (95% CI 13·8–NE) with ACP versus 18·7 months (95% CI 13·4–NE) with BCP in EGFR-positive patients (HR 0·93 [95% CI 0·51–1·68]). No overall survival benefit was seen with ACP versus BCP in patients with sensitising EGFR mutations (HR 0·90 [95% CI 0·47–1·74]), in the intention-to-treat population (HR 0·85 [0·71–1·03]), or in patients with baseline liver metastases (HR 0·87 [0·57–1·32]). In the intention-to-treat safety-evaluable population, grade 3–4 treatment-related events occurred in 223 (57%) patients in the ABCP group, in 172 (43%) in the ACP group, and in 191 (49%) in the BCP group; 11 (3%) grade 5 adverse events occurred in the ABCP group, as did four (1%) in the ACP group, and nine (2%) in the BCP group.
Interpretation
Improved survival was noted for patients treated with ABCP compared with those given BCP in the intention-to-treat population, and in patients with baseline liver metastases. The overall survival signal in the subgroup of patients with EGFR sensitising mutations warrants further study.

α1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) remains the only readily identified genetic cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Furthermore, there is growing evidence that even a moderate deficiency increases the risk of lung disease among smokers. Despite these facts, the uptake of testing for AATD in at-risk populations remains low for many reasons, and a lack of clarity among clinicians regarding the most appropriate diagnostic techniques presents a major deterrent. This Personal View addresses the benefits of diagnosis, the technical basis of the available diagnostic methods, and possible clinical confounders for each test. We include a series of unusual cases encountered at our National Centre of Expertise to provide context. The topics covered should equip clinicians with the core knowledge required to confidently assess patients for AATD."

abstract = "Summary
Background
There is an urgent need for biomarkers to better stratify patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis by risk for lung transplantation allocation who have the same clinical presentation. We aimed to investigate whether a specific immune cell type from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis could identify those at higher risk of poor outcomes. We then sought to validate our findings using cytometry and electronic health records.
Methods
We first did a discovery analysis with transcriptome data from the Gene Expression Omnibus at the National Center for Biotechnology Information for 120 peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. We estimated percentages of 13 immune cell types using statistical deconvolution, and investigated the association of these cell types with transplant-free survival. We validated these results using PBMC samples from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in two independent cohorts (COMET and Yale). COMET profiled monocyte counts in 45 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis from March 12, 2010, to March 10, 2011, using flow cytometry; we tested if increased monocyte count was associated with the primary outcome of disease progression. In the Yale cohort, 15 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (with five healthy controls) were classed as high risk or low risk from April 28, 2014, to Aug 20, 2015, using a 52-gene signature, and we assessed whether monocyte percentage (measured by cytometry by time of flight) was higher in high-risk patients. We then examined complete blood count values in the electronic health records (EHR) of 45 068 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, systemic sclerosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or myelofibrosis from Stanford (Jan 01, 2008, to Dec 31, 2015), Northwestern (Feb 15, 2001 to July 31, 2017), Vanderbilt (Jan 01, 2008, to Dec 31, 2016), and Optum Clinformatics DataMart (Jan 01, 2004, to Dec 31, 2016) cohorts, and examined whether absolute monocyte counts of 0·95 K/μL or greater were associated with all-cause mortality in these patients.
Findings
In the discovery analysis, estimated CD14+ classical monocyte percentages above the mean were associated with shorter transplant-free survival times (hazard ratio [HR] 1·82, 95% CI 1·05–3·14), whereas higher percentages of T cells and B cells were not (0·97, 0·59–1·66; and 0·78, 0·45–1·34 respectively). In two validation cohorts (COMET trial and the Yale cohort), patients with higher monocyte counts were at higher risk for poor outcomes (COMET Wilcoxon p=0·025; Yale Wilcoxon p=0·049). Monocyte counts of 0·95 K/μL or greater were associated with mortality after adjusting for forced vital capacity (HR 2·47, 95% CI 1·48–4·15; p=0·0063), and the gender, age, and physiology index (HR 2·06, 95% CI 1·22–3·47; p=0·0068) across the COMET, Stanford, and Northwestern datasets). Analysis of medical records of 7459 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis showed that patients with monocyte counts of 0·95 K/μL or greater were at increased risk of mortality with lung transplantation as a censoring event, after adjusting for age at diagnosis and sex (Stanford HR=2·30, 95% CI 0·94–5·63; Vanderbilt 1·52, 1·21–1·89; Optum 1·74, 1·33–2·27). Likewise, higher absolute monocyte count was associated with shortened survival in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy across all three cohorts, and in patients with systemic sclerosis or myelofibrosis in two of the three cohorts.
Interpretation
Monocyte count could be incorporated into the clinical assessment of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other fibrotic disorders. Further investigation into the mechanistic role of monocytes in fibrosis might lead to insights that assist the development of new therapies.

Background
Genetic variation has an important role in the development of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, genetic factors for lung cancer have not been fully identified, especially in Chinese populations, which limits the use of existing polygenic risk scores (PRS) to identify subpopulations at high risk of lung cancer for prevention. We therefore aimed to identify novel loci associated with NSCLC risk, and generate a PRS and evaluate its utility and effectiveness in the prediction of lung cancer risk in Chinese populations.
Methods
To systematically identify genetic variants for NSCLC risk, we newly genotyped 19 546 samples from Chinese NSCLC cases and controls from the Nanjing Medical University Global Screening Array Project and did a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of 27 120 individuals with NSCLC and 27 355 without NSCLC (13 327 cases and 13 328 controls of Chinese descent as well as 13 793 cases and 14 027 controls of European descent). We then built a PRS for Chinese populations from all reported single-nucleotide polymorphisms that have been reported to be associated with lung cancer risk at genome-wide significance level. We evaluated the utility and effectiveness of the generated PRS in predicting subpopulations at high-risk of lung cancer in an independent prospective cohort of 95 408 individuals from the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) with more than 10 years' follow-up.
Findings
We identified 19 susceptibility loci to be significantly associated with NSCLC risk at p≤5·0 × 10−8, including six novel loci. When applied to the CKB cohort, the PRS of the risk loci successfully predicted lung cancer incident cases in a dose-response manner in participants at a high genetic risk (top 10%) than those at a low genetic risk (bottom 10%; adjusted hazard ratio 1·96, 95% CI 1·53–2·51; ptrend=2·02 × 10−9). Specially, we observed consistently separated curves of lung cancer events in individuals at low, intermediate, and high genetic risk, respectively, and PRS was an independent effective risk stratification indicator beyond age and smoking pack-years.
Interpretation
We have shown for the first time that GWAS-derived PRS can be effectively used in discriminating subpopulations at high risk of lung cancer, who might benefit from a practically feasible PRS-based lung cancer screening programme for precision prevention in Chinese populations.

For more than three decades, both medical professionals and the public have worried that many patients receive non-beneficial care in US intensive care units during their final months of life. Some of these patients wish to avoid severe cognitive and physical impairments, and protracted deaths in the hospital setting. Recognising when intensive care will not restore a person's health, and helping patients and families embrace goals related to symptom relief, interpersonal connection, or spiritual fulfilment are central challenges of critical care practice in the USA. We review trials from the past decade of interventions designed to address these challenges, and present reasons why evaluating, comparing, and implementing these interventions have been difficult. Careful scrutiny of the design and interpretation of past trials can show why improving goal concordant care has been so elusive, and suggest new directions for the next generation of research."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) treated with PRM-151, a recombinant human pentraxin 2 protein, in a phase 2 double-blind, randomised controlled trial had significantly reduced decline in percentage of predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) and stabilised 6-min walking distance compared with placebo over a 28-week period. Here we report the 76-week results of an open-label extension study.
Methods
Patients who completed the 28-week double-blind period of the PRM-151-202 trial were eligible to participate in the open-label extension study. Patients previously enrolled in the PRM-151 group continued this treatment and those previously in the placebo group crossed over to PRM-151. All patients received PRM-151 in 28-week cycles with loading doses of 10 mg/kg by 60 min intravenous infusions on days 1, 3, and 5 in the first week of each cycle followed by one infusion of 10 mg/kg every 4 weeks. The primary objective of the open-label extension study was to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of PRM-151, which were assessed by analysing adverse events (AEs) up to week 76 in all patients who received at least one dose of PRM-151 during the open-label extension study. Exploratory efficacy analyses were done by assessing changes from baseline in percentage of predicted FVC and 6-min walking distance, with descriptive statistics to week 76 and with random-intercept mixed models to week 52. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02550873, and with EudraCT, number 2014-004782-24.
Findings
Of 116 patients who completed the double-blind treatment period, 111 entered the open-label extension study (74 from the PRM-151 group and 37 from the placebo group). 84 (76%) of 111 patients received concomitant IPF therapy (pirfenidone n=55 or nintedanib n=29). AEs were consistent with long-term IPF sequelae. 31 (28%) patients had serious AEs. Those occurring in two or more patients were pneumonia (six [5%] of 111), IPF exacerbation (four [4%]), IPF progression (four [4%]), and chest pain (two [2%]). 21 (19%) patients had severe AEs, of which IPF exacerbation and IPF progression each occurred in two (2%) patients. Two (2%) patients experienced life-threatening AEs (one had pneumonia and one had small-cell lung cancer extensive stage). A persistent treatment effect was observed for PRM-151 in patients who continued treatment, with a decline in percentage of predicted FVC of −3·6% per year and in 6-min walking distance of −10·5 m per year at week 52. In patients who started PRM-151 during the open-label extension study, compared with the slopes for placebo, decline reduced for percentage of predicted FVC (from −8·7% per year in weeks 0–28 to −0·9% per year in weeks 28–52, p<0·0001) and 6-min walking distance (from −54·9 m per year to −3·5 m per year, p=0·0224).
Interpretation
Long-term treatment with PRM-151 was well tolerated and the effects on percentage of predicted FVC and 6-min walking distance were persistent on continuation and positive in patients who crossed over from placebo. These findings support further study of PRM-151 in larger populations of patients with IPF.

abstract = "Summary
Background
No dedicated randomised clinical trials have evaluated therapies for pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients with portopulmonary hypertension. The endothelin receptor antagonist macitentan has demonstrated long-term efficacy in pulmonary arterial hypertension with a good hepatic safety profile. We aimed to evaluate efficacy and safety of macitentan in patients with portopulmonary hypertension.
Methods
PORTICO was a phase 4 study done in 36 centres in seven countries, consisting of a 12-week double-blind period (randomly assigned 1:1 to macitentan 10 mg or placebo once daily) followed by a 12-week open-label period. Adults (≥18 years) with portopulmonary hypertension, a 6-minute walk distance of 50 m or more, and with pulmonary vascular resistance of 320 dyn·s·cm−5 or more without severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C or model for end-stage liver disease score ≥19) were eligible. The primary endpoint was pulmonary vascular resistance at week 12, expressed as ratio of baseline in the full analysis set. Safety was assessed throughout. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02382016.
Findings
Between June 23, 2015, and July 28, 2017, 85 patients were randomly assigned to macitentan (n=43) or placebo (n=42). At baseline, 54 (64%) were receiving background therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension. Most patients were WHO functional class II (50, 59%) or III (33, 39%) with a mean 6-minute walk distance of 384·5 m (SD 103·9). At week 12, the geometric mean ratio of baseline pulmonary vascular resistance was 0·63 (95% CI 0·58–0·67) in the macitentan group and 0·98 (95% CI 0·91–1·05) in the placebo group, corresponding to a ratio of geometric mean for pulmonary vascular resistance of 0·65 (95% CI 0·59–0·72, p<0·0001), which in turn represented a 35% (95% CI 28–41) reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance with macitentan versus placebo. During the double-blind period, 36 (84%) macitentan-treated and 33 (79%) placebo-treated patients had adverse events, and nine (21%) and six (14%), had serious adverse events. Four (9%) macitentan-treated patients had an adverse event leading to discontinuation versus none in the placebo group. The most frequent adverse event during the double-blind period was peripheral oedema (11 [26%] in the macitentan group and five [12%] in the placebo group).
Interpretation
Macitentan significantly improved pulmonary vascular resistance in portopulmonary hypertension patients, with no hepatic safety concerns.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Maximal expiratory airflow peaks early in the third decade of life, then gradually declines with age. The pattern of airflow through adulthood for individuals born very preterm (at <32 weeks' gestation) or with very low birthweight (<1501 g) is unknown. We aimed to compare maximal expiratory airflow in these individuals during late adolescence and early adulthood with that of control individuals born with normal birthweight (>2499 g) or at term.
Methods
We did a meta-analysis of individual participant data from cohort studies, mostly from the pre-surfactant era. Studies were identified through the Adults born Preterm International Collaboration and by searching PubMed and Embase (search date May 25, 2016). Studies were eligible if they reported on expiratory flow rates beyond 16 years of age in individuals born very preterm or with very low birthweight, as well as controls born at term or with normal birthweight. Studies with highly selected cohorts (eg, only participants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia) or in which few participants were born very preterm or with very low birthweight were excluded. De-identified individual participant data from each cohort were provided by the holders of the original data to a central site, where all the data were pooled into one data file. Any data inconsistencies were resolved by discussion with the individual sites concerned. Individual participant data on expiratory flow variables (FEV1, forced vital capacity [FVC], FEV1/FVC ratio, and forced expiratory flow at 25–75% of FVC [FEF25–75%]) were converted to Z scores and analysed with use of generalised linear mixed models in a one-step approach.
Findings
Of the 381 studies identified, 11 studies, comprising a total of 935 participants born very preterm or with very low birthweight and 722 controls, were eligible and included in the analysis. Mean age at testing was 21 years (SD 3·4; range 16–33). Mean Z scores were close to zero (as expected) in the control group, but were reduced in the very preterm or very low birthweight group for FEV1 (−0·06 [SD 1·03] vs −0·81 [1·33], mean difference −0·78 [95% CI −0·96 to −0·61], p<0·0001), FVC (−0·15 [0·98] vs −0·38 [1·18], −0·25 [–0·40 to −0·10], p=0·0012), FEV1/FVC ratio (0·14 [1·10] vs −0·64 [1·35], −0·74 [–0·85 to −0·64], p<0·0001), and FEF25–75% (−0·04 [1·10] vs −0·95 [1·47], −0·88 [–1·12 to −0·65], p<0·0001). Similar patterns were observed when we compared the proportions of individuals with values below the fifth percentile.
Interpretation
Individuals born very preterm or with very low birthweight are at risk of not reaching their full airway growth potential in adolescence and early adulthood, suggesting an increased risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in later adulthood.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The efficacy and effectiveness of the pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) component in live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) is poor. The reasons for this paucity are unclear but could be due to impaired replicative fitness of pH1N1 A/California/07/2009-like (Cal09) strains. We assessed whether an updated pH1N1 strain in the Russian-backbone trivalent LAIV resulted in greater shedding and immunogenicity compared with LAIV with Cal09.
Methods
We did an open-label, prospective, observational, phase 4 study in Sukuta, a periurban area in The Gambia. We enrolled children aged 24–59 months who were clinically well. Children received one dose of the WHO prequalified Russian-backbone trivalent LAIV containing either A/17/California/2009/38 (Cal09) or A/17/New York/15/5364 (NY15) based on their year of enrolment. Primary outcomes were the percentage of children with LAIV strain shedding at day 2 and day 7, haemagglutinin inhibition seroconversion, and an increase in influenza haemagglutinin-specific IgA and T-cell responses at day 21 after LAIV. This study is nested within a randomised controlled trial investigating LAIV–microbiome interactions (NCT02972957).
Findings
Between Feb 8, 2017, and April 12, 2017, 118 children were enrolled and received one dose of the Cal09 LAIV from 2016–17. Between Jan 15, 2018, and March 28, 2018, a separate cohort of 135 children were enrolled and received one dose of the NY15 LAIV from 2017–18, of whom 126 children completed the study. Cal09 showed impaired pH1N1 nasopharyngeal shedding (16 of 118 children [14%, 95% CI 8·0–21·1] with shedding at day 2 after administration of LAIV) compared with H3N2 (54 of 118 [46%, 36·6–55·2]; p<0·0001) and influenza B (95 of 118 [81%, 72·2–87·2]; p<0·0001), along with suboptimal serum antibody (seroconversion in six of 118 [5%, 1·9–10·7]) and T-cell responses (CD4+ interferon γ-positive and/or CD4+ interleukin 2-positive responses in 45 of 111 [41%, 31·3–50·3]). After the switch to NY15, a significant increase in pH1N1 shedding was seen (80 of 126 children [63%, 95% CI 54·4–71·9]; p<0·0001 compared with Cal09), along with improvements in seroconversion (24 of 126 [19%, 13·2–26·8]; p=0·011) and influenza-specific CD4+ T-cell responses (73 of 111 [66%, 60·0–75·6; p=0·00028]). The improvement in pH1N1 seroconversion with NY15 was even greater in children who were seronegative at baseline (24 of 64 children [38%, 95% CI 26·7–49·8] vs six of 79 children with Cal09 [8%, 2·8–15·8]; p<0·0001). Persistent shedding to day 7 was independently associated with both seroconversion (odds ratio 12·69, 95% CI 4·1–43·6; p<0·0001) and CD4+ T-cell responses (odds ratio 7·83, 95% CI 2·99–23·5; p<0·0001) by multivariable logistic regression.
Interpretation
The pH1N1 component switch that took place between 2016 and 2018 might have overcome the poor efficacy and effectiveness reported with previous LAIV formulations. LAIV effectiveness against pH1N1 should, therefore, improve in upcoming influenza seasons. Our data highlight the importance of assessing replicative fitness, in addition to antigenicity, when selecting annual LAIV components.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) could be an alternative to multi-modality staging of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but its diagnostic accuracy, effect on staging times, number of tests needed, cost, and effect on treatment decisions are unknown. We aimed to prospectively compare the diagnostic accuracy and efficiency of WB-MRI-based staging pathways with standard pathways in NSCLC.
Methods
The Streamline L trial was a prospective, multicentre trial done in 16 hospitals in England. Eligible patients were 18 years or older, with newly diagnosed NSCLC that was potentially radically treatable on diagnostic chest CT (defined as stage IIIb or less). Exclusion criteria were severe systemic disease, pregnancy, contraindications to MRI, or histologies other than NSCLC. Patients underwent WB-MRI, the result of which was withheld until standard staging investigations were complete and the first treatment decision made. The multidisciplinary team recorded its treatment decision based on standard investigations, then on the WB-MRI staging pathway (WB-MRI plus additional tests generated), and finally on all tests. The primary outcome was difference in per-patient sensitivity for metastases between standard and WB-MRI staging pathways against a consensus reference standard at 12 months, in the per-protocol population. Secondary outcomes were difference in per-patient specificity for metastatic disease detection between standard and WB-MRI staging pathways, differences in treatment decisions, staging efficiency (time taken, test number, and costs) and per-organ sensitivity and specificity for metastases and per-patient agreement for local T and N stage. This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial registry, number ISRCTN50436483, and is complete.
Findings
Between Feb 26, 2013, and Sept 5, 2016, 976 patients were screened for eligibility. 353 patients were recruited, 187 of whom completed the trial; 52 (28%) had metastasis at baseline. Pathway sensitivity was 50% (95% CI 37–63) for WB-MRI and 54% (41–67) for standard pathways, a difference of 4% (−7 to 15, p=0·73). No adverse events related to imaging were reported. Specificity did not differ between WB-MRI (93% [88–96]) and standard pathways (95% [91–98], p=0·45). Agreement with the multidisciplinary team's final treatment decision was 98% for WB-MRI and 99% for the standard pathway. Time to complete staging was shorter for WB-MRI (13 days [12–14]) than for the standard pathway (19 days [17–21]); a 6-day (4–8) difference. The number of tests required was similar WB-MRI (one [1–1]) and standard pathways (one [1–2]). Mean per-patient costs were £317 (273–361) for WBI-MRI and £620 (574–666) for standard pathways.
Interpretation
WB-MRI staging pathways have similar accuracy to standard pathways, and reduce the staging time and costs.

abstract = "Summary
Background
In the appropriate clinical setting, the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) requires a pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia to be present on high-resolution chest CT (HRCT) or surgical lung biopsy. A molecular usual interstitial pneumonia signature can be identified by a machine learning algorithm in less-invasive transbronchial lung biopsy samples. We report prospective findings for the clinical validity and utility of this molecular test.
Methods
We prospectively recruited 237 patients for this study from those enrolled in the Bronchial Sample Collection for a Novel Genomic Test (BRAVE) study in 29 US and European sites. Patients were undergoing evaluation for interstitial lung disease and had had samples obtained by clinically indicated surgical or transbronchial biopsy or cryobiopsy for pathology. Histopathological diagnoses were made by experienced pathologists. Available HRCT scans were reviewed centrally. Three to five transbronchial lung biopsy samples were collected from all patients specifically for this study, pooled by patient, and extracted for transcriptomic sequencing. After exclusions, diagnostic histopathology and RNA sequence data from 90 patients were used to train a machine learning algorithm (Envisia Genomic Classifier, Veracyte, San Francisco, CA, USA) to identify a usual interstitial pneumonia pattern. The primary study endpoint was validation of the classifier in 49 patients by comparison with diagnostic histopathology. To assess clinical utility, we compared the agreement and confidence level of diagnosis made by central multidisciplinary teams based on anonymised clinical information and radiology results plus either molecular classifier or histopathology results.
Findings
The classifier identified usual interstitial pneumonia in transbronchial lung biopsy samples from 49 patients with 88% specificity (95% CI 70–98) and 70% sensitivity (47–87). Among 42 of these patients who had possible or inconsistent usual interstitial pneumonia on HRCT, the classifier showed 81% positive predictive value (95% CI 54–96) for underlying biopsy-proven usual interstitial pneumonia. In the clinical utility analysis, we found 86% agreement (95% CI 78–92) between clinical diagnoses using classifier results and those using histopathology data. Diagnostic confidence was improved by the molecular classifier results compared with histopathology results in 18 with IPF diagnoses (proportion of diagnoses that were confident or provisional with high confidence 89% vs 56%, p=0·0339) and in all 48 patients with non-diagnostic pathology or non-classifiable fibrosis histopathology (63% vs 42%, p=0·0412).
Interpretation
The molecular test provided an objective method to aid clinicians and multidisciplinary teams in ascertaining a diagnosis of IPF, particularly for patients without a clear radiological diagnosis, in samples that can be obtained by a less invasive method. Further prospective clinical validation and utility studies are planned.

abstract = "Summary
Background
There is a scarcity of published data on the global prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea, a disorder associated with major neurocognitive and cardiovascular sequelae. We used publicly available data and contacted key opinion leaders to estimate the global prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea.
Methods
We searched PubMed and Embase to identify published studies reporting the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea based on objective testing methods. A conversion algorithm was created for studies that did not use the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) 2012 scoring criteria to identify obstructive sleep apnoea, allowing determination of an equivalent apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) for publications that used different criteria. The presence of symptoms was not specifically analysed because of scarce information about symptoms in the reference studies and population data. Prevalence estimates for obstructive sleep apnoea across studies using different diagnostic criteria were standardised with a newly developed algorithm. Countries without obstructive sleep apnoea prevalence data were matched to a similar country with available prevalence data; population similarity was based on the population body-mass index, race, and geographical proximity. The primary outcome was prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea based on AASM 2012 diagnostic criteria in individuals aged 30–69 years (as this age group generally had available data in the published studies and related to information from the UN for all countries).
Findings
Reliable prevalence data for obstructive sleep apnoea were available for 16 countries, from 17 studies. Using AASM 2012 diagnostic criteria and AHI threshold values of five or more events per h and 15 or more events per h, we estimated that 936 million (95% CI 903–970) adults aged 30–69 years (men and women) have mild to severe obstructive sleep apnoea and 425 million (399–450) adults aged 30–69 years have moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnoea globally. The number of affected individuals was highest in China, followed by the USA, Brazil, and India.
Interpretation
To our knowledge, this is the first study to report global prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea; with almost 1 billion people affected, and with prevalence exceeding 50% in some countries, effective diagnostic and treatment strategies are needed to minimise the negative health impacts and to maximise cost-effectiveness.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive (ALK-positive) disease occurs in approximately 5% of all patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, with a similar incidence reported in Asian patients. This study is the first phase 3 randomised trial recruiting only Asian patients to compare alectinib with crizotinib as a first-line treatment for ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer with 600 mg of alectinib twice per day. This study assessed consistency of the progression-free survival benefit with the global phase 3 ALEX study.
Methods
In this randomised, open-label, phase 3 study done at 21 investigational sites in China, South Korea, and Thailand, Asian patients, aged 18 years or older, with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer were randomly assigned (2:1) to twice-daily oral alectinib (600 mg) or crizotinib (250 mg). Patients were randomly assigned via a block-stratified (block size three) randomisation procedure, done centrally via an interactive voice or web response system, with stratification by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and baseline CNS metastases. Clinical staff and the funder's drug safety and medical monitoring staff had access to treatment assignments. The independent review committee was masked to treatment assignment, and funder personnel did not have access to efficacy and safety summaries by treatment group, before the formal reporting of study results. Patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases were permitted. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. The primary analysis population for efficacy was the intention-to-treat population, defined as all randomly assigned patients. The primary analysis population for safety was defined as all patients who received at least one dose of study medication. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02838420.
Findings
Between Aug 3, 2016, and May 16, 2017, 187 patients were randomly assigned to treatment: 125 to alectinib and 62 to crizotinib. Median follow-up was 16·2 months (IQR 13·7–17·6) in the alectinib group, and 15·0 months (12·5–17·3) in the crizotinib group. Investigator-assessed progression-free survival was significantly prolonged with alectinib versus crizotinib (hazard ratio [HR] 0·22, 95% CI 0·13–0·38; p<0·0001; median progression-free survival not estimable vs 11·1 months). Independent review committee-assessed progression-free survival was also significantly longer in the alectinib group compared with the crizotinib group (HR 0·37, 0·22–0·61; p<0·0001). The proportion of patients who achieved an objective response was 114 (91%) of 125 with alectinib, and 48 (77%) of 62 with crizotinib, with a longer duration of response for alectinib than crizotinib (HR 0·22, 95% CI 0·12–0·40; p<0·0001). Time to CNS progression (cause-specific HR 0·14) and the percentage of patients who achieved a CNS objective response with measurable or non-measurable baseline CNS lesions were improved (32 [73%] of 44 patients treated with alectinib vs five [22%] of 23 patients treated with crizotinib). Despite longer treatment duration with alectinib than crizotinib (14·7 months vs 12·6 months, respectively), fewer patients had grade 3–5 adverse events (36 [29%] of 125 vs 30 [48%] of 62, respectively) or serious adverse events (19 [15%] of 125 vs 16 [26%] of 62, respectively).
Interpretation
Our results align with ALEX, confirming the clinical benefit of 600 mg of alectinib twice per day as a first-line treatment for ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Previous studies have highlighted a relationship between reduction in rate of exacerbations with therapies containing inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and baseline blood eosinophil count in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The IMPACT trial showed that once-daily single-inhaler triple therapy significantly reduced exacerbations versus dual therapies. Blood eosinophil counts and smoking status could be important modifiers of treatment response to ICS. We aimed to model these relationships and their interactions, including outcomes other than exacerbations.
Methods
IMPACT was a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, 52-week global study comparing once-daily single-inhaler triple therapy (fluticasone furoate–umeclidinium–vilanterol) with dual inhaled therapy (fluticasone furoate–vilanterol or umeclidinium–vilanterol). Eligible patients had moderate-to-very-severe COPD and at least one moderate or severe exacerbation in the previous year. We used fractional polynomials to model continuous blood eosinophil counts. We used negative binomial regression for numbers of moderate and severe exacerbations, severe exacerbations, and pneumonia. We modelled differences at week 52 in trough FEV1, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score, and Transition Dyspnoea Index using repeated measurements mixed effect models. IMPACT was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02164513.
Findings
The magnitude of benefit of regimens containing ICS (fluticasone furoate–umeclidinium–vilanterol n=4151 and fluticasone furoate–vilanterol n=4134) in reducing rates of moderate and severe exacerbations increased in proportion with blood eosinophil count, compared with a non-ICS dual long-acting bronchodilator (umeclidinium–vilanterol n=2070). The moderate and severe exacerbation rate ratio for triple therapy versus umeclidinium–vilanterol was 0·88 (95% CI 0·74 to 1·04) at blood eosinophil count less than 90 cells per μL and 0·56 (0·47 to 0·66) at counts of 310 cells per μL or more; the corresponding rate ratio for fluticasone furoate–vilanterol versus umeclidinium–vilanterol was 1·09 (0·91 to 1·29) and 0·56 (0·47 to 0·66), respectively. Similar results were observed for FEV1, Transition Dyspnoea Index, and SGRQ total score; however, the relationship with FEV1 was less marked. At blood eosinophil counts less than 90 cells per μL and at counts of 310 cells per μL or more, the triple therapy versus umeclidinium–vilanterol treatment difference was 40 mL (95% CI 10 to 70) and 60 mL (20 to 100) for trough FEV1, −0·01 (–0·68 to 0·66) and 0·30 (–0·37 to 0·97) for Transition Dyspnoea Index score, and −0·01 (–1·81 to 1·78) and −2·78 (–4·64 to −0·92) for SGRQ total score, respectively. Smoking status modified the relationship between observed efficacy and blood eosinophil count for moderate or severe exacerbations, Transition Dyspnoea Index, and FEV1, with former smokers being more corticosteroid responsive at any eosinophil count than current smokers.
Interpretation
This analysis of the IMPACT trial shows that assessment of blood eosinophil count and smoking status has the potential to optimise ICS use in clinical practice in patients with COPD and a history of exacerbations.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Inhaled hypertonic saline enhances mucociliary clearance, improves lung function, and reduces pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis older than age 6 years. We aimed to assess the effect of inhaled hypertonic saline on the lung clearance index (LCI2·5)—a measure of ventilation inhomogeneity—in children aged 3–6 years with cystic fibrosis.
Methods
The Saline Hypertonic in Preschoolers (SHIP) Study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at 25 cystic fibrosis centres in Canada and the USA. Eligible participants were aged 36–72 months; had a confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis; were able to comply with medication use, study visits, and study procedures; and were able to complete at least two technically acceptable trials of multiple breath washout (MBW). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) via a web-based data entry system that confirmed enrolment eligibility to inhaled 7% hypertonic saline or 0·9% isotonic saline nebulised twice daily (for no more than 15 min per dose) for 48 weeks. Permuted block randomisation was done separately for participants aged 36–54 months and those aged 55–72 months to ensure approximate balance by treatment group in the two age groups. The primary endpoint was the change in the LCI2·5 measured by nitrogen MBW from baseline to week 48. All study sites were trained and certified in MBW. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT02378467.
Findings
Between April 21, 2015, and Aug 4, 2017, 150 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned, 76 to the hypertonic saline group and 74 to the isotonic saline group. Overall 89% of the MBW tests produced acceptable data. At 48 weeks, treatment with hypertonic saline was associated with a significant decrease (ie, improvement) in LCI2·5 compared with isotonic saline (mean treatment effect −0·63 LCI2·5 units [95% CI −1·10 to −0·15]; p=0·010). Six participants in the hypertonic saline group had ten serious adverse events and eight participants in the isotonic saline group had nine serious adverse events. The serious adverse events reported were cough (two patients [3%] in the hypertonic saline group vs three [4%] in the isotonic saline group), gastrostomy tube placement or rupture (two [3%] vs one [1%]), upper gastrointestinal disorders (one [1%] vs two [3%]), distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (one [1%] vs one [1%]), and decreased pulmonary function (none vs one [1%]). None of these serious adverse events was judged to be treatment related.
Interpretation
Inhaled hypertonic saline improved the LCI2·5 in children aged 3–6 years, and could be a suitable early intervention in cystic fibrosis.

Use of intensive care unit (ICU) resources in the USA far outpaces that of other countries. This increased use is not accompanied by superior clinical outcomes and is at times discordant with patient desires. This Series paper seeks to identify major drivers of ICU resource use in the USA, and to offer steps towards better aligning ICU resource use with clinical needs and patient preferences. After considering several factors, such as organisational, ethical, and economic factors, we suggest that there are four intersecting drivers of irresponsible use of ICU resources in the USA: first, excess ICU bed capacity and a scarcity of data to understand which patients that truly benefit from ICU compared with ward care; second, clinicians misinterpreting the goals and means of patient autonomy; third, an extreme fear of rationing by the general public; and fourth, fee-for-service driven use of advanced medical technologies and procedures that beget ICU expansion."

abstract = "Summary
Background
A hallmark of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is the excess accumulation of extracellular matrix in the lungs. Degradation of extracellular matrix generates free-circulating protein fragments called neoepitopes. The aim of the INMARK trial was to investigate changes in neoepitopes as predictors of disease progression in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and the effect of nintedanib on these biomarkers.
Methods
In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis within the past 3 years and forced vital capacity (FVC) of 80% predicted or higher were eligible to participate. Patients were recruited from hospitals, private practices, clinical research units, and academic medical centres. Patients were randomly assigned (1:2) with the use of a pseudo-random number generator to receive oral nintedanib 150 mg twice a day or placebo for 12 weeks in a double-blind fashion, followed by open-label nintedanib for 40 weeks. The primary endpoint was the rate of change in C-reactive protein (CRP) degraded by matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 8 (CRPM) from baseline to week 12 in the intention-to-treat population. The trial has been completed and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02788474, and with the European Clinical Trials Database, number 2015–003148–38.
Findings
Between June 27, 2016, and May 15, 2017, 347 patients were randomly assigned to the nintedanib group (n=116) or to the placebo group (n=231). One patient from the placebo group was not treated owing to a randomisation error. At baseline, mean FVC was 97·5% (SD 13·5) predicted. In the double-blind period, 116 patients received nintedanib and 230 patients received placebo. The rate of change in CRPM from baseline to week 12 was −2·57 × 10−3 ng/mL/month in the nintedanib group and −1·90 × 10−3 ng/mL/month in the placebo group (between-group difference −0·66 × 10−3 ng/mL/month [95% CI −6·21 × 10−3 to 4·88 × 10−3]; p=0·8146). The adjusted rate of change in FVC over 12 weeks was 5·9 mL in the nintedanib group and −70·2 mL in the placebo group (difference 76·1 mL/12 weeks [31·7 to 120·4]). In patients who received placebo for 12 weeks followed by open-label nintedanib, rising concentrations of CRPM over 12 weeks were associated with disease progression (absolute decline in FVC ≥10% predicted or death) over 52 weeks. In the double-blind period, serious adverse events were reported in eight (7%) patients given nintedanib and 18 (8%) patients given placebo. Grade 3 diarrhoea was reported in two (2%) patients in the nintedanib group and two (1%) patients in the placebo group. No patients had grade 4 diarrhoea.
Interpretation
In patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and preserved lung function, treatment with nintedanib versus placebo for 12 weeks did not affect the rate of change in CRPM but was associated with a reduced rate of decline in FVC. These results suggest that change in CRPM is not a marker of response to nintedanib in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Childhood-onset and adult-onset asthma differ with respect to severity and comorbidities. Whether they also differ with respect to genetic risk factors has not been previously investigated in large samples. The goals of this study were to identify shared and distinct genetic risk loci for childhood-onset and adult-onset asthma, and to identify the genes that might mediate the effects of associated variation.
Methods
We did genome-wide and transcriptome-wide studies, using data from the UK Biobank, in individuals with asthma, including adults with childhood-onset asthma (onset before 12 years of age), adults with adult-onset asthma (onset between 26 and 65 years of age), and adults without asthma (controls; aged older than 38 years). We did genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for childhood-onset asthma and adult-onset asthma each compared with shared controls, and for age of asthma onset in all asthma cases, with a genome-wide significance threshold of p<5 × 10−8. Enrichment studies determined the tissues in which genes at GWAS loci were most highly expressed, and PrediXcan, a transcriptome-wide gene-based test, was used to identify candidate risk genes.
Findings
Of 376 358 British white individuals from the UK Biobank, we included 37 846 with self-reports of doctor-diagnosed asthma: 9433 adults with childhood-onset asthma; 21 564 adults with adult-onset asthma; and an additional 6849 young adults with asthma with onset between 12 and 25 years of age. For the first and second GWAS analyses, 318 237 individuals older than 38 years without asthma were used as controls. We detected 61 independent asthma loci: 23 were childhood-onset specific, one was adult-onset specific, and 37 were shared. 19 loci were associated with age of asthma onset. The most significant asthma-associated locus was at 17q12 (odds ratio 1·406, 95% CI 1·365–1·448; p=1·45 × 10−111) in the childhood-onset GWAS. Genes at the childhood onset-specific loci were most highly expressed in skin, blood, and small intestine; genes at the adult onset-specific loci were most highly expressed in lung, blood, small intestine, and spleen. PrediXcan identified 113 unique candidate genes at 22 of the 61 GWAS loci. Single-nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability estimates were more than three times larger for childhood-onset asthma (0·327) than for adult-onset disease (0·098). The onset of disease in childhood was associated with additional genes with relatively large effect sizes, with the largest odds ratio observed at the FLG locus at 1q21.3 (1·970, 95% CI 1·823–2·129).
Interpretation
Genetic risk factors for adult-onset asthma are largely a subset of the genetic risk for childhood-onset asthma but with overall smaller effects, suggesting a greater role for non-genetic risk factors in adult-onset asthma. Combined with gene expression and tissue enrichment patterns, we suggest that the establishment of disease in children is driven more by dysregulated allergy and epithelial barrier function genes, whereas the cause of adult-onset asthma is more lung-centred and environmentally determined, but with immune-mediated mechanisms driving disease progression in both children and adults.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Treatment with systemic corticosteroids in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with debilitating adverse effects. Therefore, strategies to reduce systemic corticosteroid exposure are urgently required and might be offered by a personalised biomarker-guided approach to treatment. The aim of this study was to determine whether an algorithm based on blood eosinophil counts could safely reduce systemic corticosteroid exposure in patients admitted to hospital with acute exacerbations of COPD.
Methods
We did a multicentre, randomised, controlled, open-label, non-inferiority trial at the respiratory departments of three different university-affiliated hospitals in Denmark. Eligible participants were patients included within 24h of admission to the participating sites, aged at least 40 years, with known airflow limitation (defined as a post-bronchodilator FEV1/forced vital capacity [FVC] ratio ≤0·70) and a specialist-verified diagnosis of COPD, who were designated to start on systemic corticosteroids by the respiratory medicine physician on duty. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) to either eosinophil-guided therapy or standard therapy with systemic corticosteroids. Both investigators and patients were aware of the group assignment. All patients received 80 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone on the first day. The eosinophil-guided group were from the second day given 37·5 mg of prednisolone oral tablet daily (for a maximum of up to 4 days) on days when their blood eosinophil count was at least 0·3 × 109 cells per L. On days when the eosinophil count was lower, prednisolone was not administered. If a patient was discharged during the treatment period, a treatment based on the last measured eosinophil count was prescribed for the remaining days within the 5-day period (last observation carried forward). The control group received 37·5 mg of prednisolone tablets daily from the second day for 4 days. The primary outcome was the number of days alive and out of hospital within 14 days after recruitment, assessed by intention to treat (ITT). Secondary outcomes included treatment failure at day 30 (ie, recurrence of acute exacerbation of COPD resulting in emergency room visits, admission to hospital, or need to intensify pharmacological treatment), number of deaths on day 30, and duration of treatment with systemic corticosteroids. The non-inferiority margin was 1·2 days (SD 3·8). This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02857842, and was completed in January, 2019.
Findings
Between Aug 3, 2016, and Sept 30, 2018, 159 patients in the eosinophil-guided group and 159 patients in the control group were included in the ITT analyses. There was no between-group difference for days alive and out of hospital within 14 days after recruitment: mean 8·9 days (95% CI 8·3–9·6) in the eosinophil-guided group versus 9·3 days (8·7–9·9) in the control group (absolute difference –0·4, 95% CI −1·3 to 0·5; p=0·34). Treatment failure at 30 days occurred in 42 (26%) of 159 patients in the eosinophil-guided group and 41 (26%) of 159 in the control group (difference 0·6%, 95% CI −9·0 to 10·3; p=0·90). At 30 days nine patients (6%) of 159 in the eosinophil-guided group and six (4%) of 159 in the control group had died (difference 1·9%, 95% CI −2·8 to 6·5; p=0·43). Median duration of systemic corticosteroid therapy was lower in the eosinophil-guided group: 2 days (IQR 1·0 to 3·0) compared with 5 days (5·0 to 5·0) in the control group, p<0·0001.
Interpretation
Eosinophil-guided therapy was non-inferior compared with standard care for the number of days alive and out of hospital, and reduced the duration of systemic corticosteroid exposure, although we could not entirely exclude harm on some secondary outcome measures. Larger studies will help to determine the full safety profile of this strategy and its role in the management of COPD exacerbations.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The incidence of hospital-acquired pneumonia remains high globally and treatment can often be ineffective. Here, we review the available data and unanswered questions surrounding hospital-acquired pneumonia, discuss alterations of the respiratory microbiome and of the mucosal immunity in patients admitted to hospital, and explore potential approaches to stratify patients for tailored treatments. The lungs have been considered a sterile organ for decades because microbiological culture techniques had shown negative results. Culture-independent techniques have shown that healthy lungs harbour a diverse and dynamic ecosystem of bacteria, changing our comprehension of respiratory physiopathology. Understanding dysbiosis of the respiratory microbiome and altered mucosal immunity in patients with critical illness holds great promise to develop targeted host-directed immunotherapy to reduce ineffective treatment, to improve patient outcomes, and to tackle the global threat of resistant bacteria that cause these infections."

abstract = "Summary
The composition of the lung microbiome is increasingly well characterised, with changes in microbial diversity or abundance observed in association with several chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, the precise effects of the microbiome on pulmonary health and the functional mechanisms by which it regulates host immunity are only now beginning to be elucidated. Bacteria, viruses, and fungi from both the upper and lower respiratory tract produce structural ligands and metabolites that interact with the host and alter the development and progression of chronic respiratory diseases. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of the composition of the lung microbiome, including the virome and mycobiome, the mechanisms by which these microbes interact with host immunity, and their functional effects on the pathogenesis, exacerbations, and comorbidities of chronic respiratory diseases. We also describe the present understanding of how respiratory microbiota can influence the efficacy of common therapies for chronic respiratory disease, and the potential of manipulation of the microbiome as a therapeutic strategy. Finally, we highlight some of the limitations in the field and propose how these could be addressed in future research."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality. Potentially pathogenic organisms are present in the respiratory tract in both symptomatic and asymptomatic children, but their presence does not necessarily indicate disease. We aimed to assess the concordance between upper and lower respiratory tract microbiota during LRTIs and the use of nasopharyngeal microbiota to discriminate LRTIs from health.
Methods
First, we did a prospective study of children aged between 4 weeks and 5 years who were admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at Wilhelmina Children's Hospital (Utrecht, Netherlands) for a WHO-defined LRTI requiring mechanical ventilation. We obtained paired nasopharyngeal swabs and deep endotracheal aspirates from these participants (the so-called PICU cohort) between Sept 10, 2013, and Sept 4, 2016. We also did a matched case-control study (1:2) with the same inclusion criteria in children with LRTIs at three Dutch teaching hospitals and in age-matched, sex-matched, and time-matched healthy children recruited from the community. Nasopharyngeal samples were obtained at admission for cases and during home visits for controls. Data for child characteristics were obtained by questionnaires and from pharmacy printouts and medical charts. We used quantitative PCR and 16S rRNA-based sequencing to establish viral and bacterial microbiota profiles, respectively. We did sparse random forest classifier analyses on the bacterial data, viral data, metadata, and the combination of all three datasets to distinguish cases from controls.
Findings
29 patients were enrolled in the PICU cohort. Intra-individual concordance in terms of viral microbiota profiles (96% agreement [95% CI 93–99]) and bacterial microbiota profiles (58 taxa with a median Pearson's r 0·93 [IQR 0·62–0·99]; p<0·05 for all 58 taxa) was high between nasopharyngeal and endotracheal aspirate samples, supporting the use of nasopharyngeal samples as proxy for lung microbiota during LRTIs. 154 cases and 307 matched controls were prospectively recruited to our case-control cohort. Individually, bacterial microbiota (area under the curve 0·77), viral microbiota (0·70), and child characteristics (0·80) poorly distinguished health from disease. However, a classification model based on combined bacterial and viral microbiota plus child characteristics distinguished children with LRTIs from their matched controls with a high degree of accuracy (area under the curve 0·92).
Interpretation
Our data suggest that the nasopharyngeal microbiota can serve as a valid proxy for lower respiratory tract microbiota in childhood LRTIs, that clinical LRTIs in children result from the interplay between microbiota and host characteristics, rather than a single microorganism, and that microbiota-based diagnostics could improve future diagnostic and treatment protocols.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of lumacaftor and ivacaftor are established in patients aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis, homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. We assessed the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of lumacaftor and ivacaftor in children aged 2–5 years.
Methods
In this multicentre, phase 3, open-label, two-part study, we enrolled children aged 2–5 years, weighing at least 8 kg at enrolment, with a confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis who were homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. Children received lumacaftor 100 mg and ivacaftor 125 mg (bodyweight <14 kg) or lumacaftor 150 mg and ivacaftor 188 mg (bodyweight ≥14 kg) orally every 12 h for 15 days in part A (to assess pharmacokinetics and safety) and for 24 weeks in part B (to assess safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy). Children could participate in part A, part B, or both. Children were enrolled into part A at five sites in the USA and into part B at 20 sites in North America (USA, 17 sites; Canada, three sites). The primary endpoints of the study were the pharmacokinetics (part A) and safety (part B) of lumacaftor and ivacaftor; all analyses were done in children who received at least one dose of lumacaftor and ivacaftor. Secondary endpoints in part A were safety and pharmacokinetics of the metabolites of lumacaftor and ivacaftor, and in part B included pharmacokinetics in children who received at least one dose of lumacaftor and ivacaftor and absolute changes from baseline in sweat chloride concentration, growth parameters, and markers of pancreatic function. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02797132.
Findings
The study was done from May 13, 2016, to Sept 8, 2017. 12 children enrolled in part A, 11 of whom completed the 15-day treatment period and enrolled in part B. 60 children enrolled in part B, 56 of whom completed the 24-week treatment period. Safety and pharmacokinetics were consistent with the well characterised safety profile of lumacaftor and ivacaftor. In part B, most children (59 [98%] of 60 children) had one or more treatment-emergent adverse events; most events were mild to moderate in severity. The most common adverse events were cough (38 [63%] of 60), vomiting (17 [28%]), pyrexia (17 [28%]), and rhinorrhoea (15 [25%]). Serious adverse events occurred in four children: infective pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis (n=2), gastroenteritis viral (n=1), and constipation (n=1). Three (5%) of 60 children discontinued treatment because of elevated serum aminotransferase concentrations. Mean sweat chloride concentrations decreased by 31·7 mmol/L, biomarkers of pancreatic function improved (fecal elastase-1 concentrations increased and serum immunoreactive trypsinogen concentrations decreased), and growth parameters increased at week 24.
Interpretation
Lumacaftor and ivacaftor were generally safe and well tolerated in children aged 2–5 years with cystic fibrosis for 24 weeks. Efficacy findings also suggest that early intervention with lumacaftor and ivacaftor has the potential to modify the course of disease.

abstract = "Summary
Acute respiratory failure occurs in up to half of patients with haematological malignancies and 15% of those with solid tumours or solid organ transplantation. Mortality remains high. Factors associated with mortality include a need for invasive mechanical ventilation, organ dysfunction, older age, frailty or poor performance status, delayed intensive care unit admission, and acute respiratory failure due to an invasive fungal infection or unknown cause. In addition to appropriate antibacterial therapy, initial clinical management aims to restore oxygenation and predict the most probable cause based on variables related to the underlying disease, acute respiratory failure characteristics, and radiographic findings. The cause of acute respiratory failure must then be confirmed using the most efficient, least invasive, and safest diagnostic tests. In patients with acute respiratory failure of undetermined cause, a standardised diagnostic investigation should be done immediately at admission before deciding whether to perform more invasive diagnostic procedures or to start empirical treatments. Collaborative and multidisciplinary clinical and research networks are crucial to improve our understanding of disease pathogenesis and causation and to develop less invasive diagnostic strategies and more targeted treatment options."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Adjuvant chemotherapy after radical resection of stage IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has quite poor outcomes. We aimed to investigate whether adjuvant erlotinib therapy improves 2-year disease-free survival compared with chemotherapy in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive stage IIIA NSCLC.
Methods
In this randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial, eligible patients aged 18–75 years who had undergone complete (R0) resection of histologically or pathologically confirmed stage IIIA EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC and had not received any previous anticancer therapies were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either adjuvant erlotinib (150 mg once daily administered orally) or vinorelbine and cisplatin chemotherapy (four cycles of vinorelbine [25 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle] plus cisplatin [75 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 of each 21-day cycle]). Randomisation was done by Simon's minimisation with a random element and was stratified by EGFR activating mutation type (exon 19 vs 21), histology (adenocarcinoma vs non-adenocarcinoma), and smoking status (smoker vs non-smoker). The primary endpoint in the unblinded intention-to-treat analysis was 2-year disease-free survival. This ongoing study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01683175.
Findings
Between Sept 8, 2012, and May 21, 2015, 102 patients from 16 centres across China were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive erlotinib (n=51) or chemotherapy (n=51). Median follow-up was 33·0 months (IQR 17·8–43·1). 2-year disease-free survival was 81·4% (95% CI 69·6–93·1) in the erlotinib group and 44·6% (26·9–62·4) in the chemotherapy group (relative risk 1·823 [95% CI 1·194–2·784; p=0·0054). The difference in 2-year disease-free survival between the groups was 36·7% (95% CI 15·5–58·0; p=0·0007). Adverse events of any grade occurred in 29 (58%) of 50 patients in the erlotinib group and 28 (65%) of 43 patients in the chemotherapy group. Grade 3 or worse adverse events occurred in six (12%) of 50 patients in the erlotinib group versus 11 (26%) of 43 in the chemotherapy group; the most common of these in the erlotinib group was rash (in two [4%] of 50 patients) and in the chemotherapy group were decreased neutrophil count (in seven [16%] of 43 patients) and myelosuppression (in four [9%]). No treatment-related deaths were reported.
Interpretation
Adjuvant erlotinib improved 2-year disease-free survival in patients with EGFR mutation-positive stage IIIA NSCLC compared with chemotherapy, with a better tolerability profile. This study suggests that tyrosine kinase inhibitors could have a potentially important role as adjuvant therapy in EGFR mutation-positive stage IIIA NSCLC. However, this trial was a phase 2 study. Mature overall survival data are also needed. Ongoing studies will hopefully confirm the role of adjuvant EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in patients with NSCLC.

abstract = "Summary
Background
In fibrotic interstitial lung diseases, exertional breathlessness is strongly linked to health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Breathlessness is often associated with oxygen desaturation, but few data about the use of ambulatory oxygen in patients with fibrotic interstitial lung disease are available. We aimed to assess the effects of ambulatory oxygen on HRQOL in patients with interstitial lung disease with isolated exertional hypoxia.
Methods
AmbOx was a prospective, open-label, mixed-method, crossover randomised controlled clinical trial done at three centres for interstitial lung disease in the UK. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had fibrotic interstitial lung disease, were not hypoxic at rest but had a fall in transcutaneous arterial oxygen saturation to 88% or less on a screening visit 6-min walk test (6MWT), and had self-reported stable respiratory symptoms in the previous 2 weeks. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either oxygen treatment or no oxygen treatment for 2 weeks, followed by crossover for another 2 weeks. Randomisation was by a computer-generated sequence of treatments randomly permuted in blocks of constant size (fixed size of ten). The primary outcome, which was assessed by intention to treat, was the change in total score on the King's Brief Interstitial Lung Disease questionnaire (K-BILD) after 2 weeks on oxygen compared with 2 weeks of no treatment. General linear models with treatment sequence as a fixed effect were used for analysis. Patient views were explored through semi-structured topic-guided interviews in a subgroup of participants. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02286063, and is closed to new participants with all follow-up completed.
Findings
Between Sept 10, 2014, and Oct 5, 2016, 84 patients were randomly assigned, 41 randomised to ambulatory oxygen first and 43 to no oxygen. 76 participants completed the trial. Compared with no oxygen, ambulatory oxygen was associated with significant improvements in total K-BILD scores (mean 55·5 [SD 13·8] on oxygen vs 51·8 [13·6] on no oxygen, mean difference adjusted for order of treatment 3·7 [95% CI 1·8 to 5·6]; p<0·0001), and scores in breathlessness and activity (mean difference 8·6 [95% CI 4·7 to 12·5]; p<0·0001) and chest symptoms (7·6 [1·9 to 13·2]; p=0·009) subdomains. However, the effect on the psychological subdomain was not significant (2·4 [–0·6 to 5·5]; p=0·12). The most common adverse events were upper respiratory tract infections (three in the oxygen group and one in the no-treatment group). Five serious adverse events, including two deaths (one in each group) occurred, but none were considered to be related to treatment.
Interpretation
Ambulatory oxygen seemed to be associated with improved HRQOL in patients with interstitial lung disease with isolated exertional hypoxia and could be an effective intervention in this patient group, who have few therapeutic options. However, further studies are needed to confirm this finding.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Severe emphysema is a debilitating condition with few treatment options. Lung volume reduction procedures in the treatment of severe emphysema have shown excellent results in selected patients but their exact role remains unclear with studies reporting a wide variation in outcomes. We therefore aimed to evaluate the effects of volume reduction.
Methods
We did a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched MEDLINE on Sept 29, 2016, for trials of lung volume reduction in patients with emphysema, and we did an updated search on Embase and PubMed on June 18, 2018. We only included randomised controlled studies published in English evaluating the intervention with either sham or standard of care. Inclusion was limited to trials of techniques in which there was sustainable volume reduction. Primary outcomes were residual volume, FEV1, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and 6-min walk distance (6MWT). Secondary outcomes were severe adverse events (including mortality), short-term mortality, and overall mortality. We extracted summary level data from the trial publications and where necessary we obtained unpublished data. A random-effects model with the I2 statistic was used to determine heterogeneity and trial weight in each analysis. The study is registered with the PROSPERO database, number CRD42016045705.
Findings
We identified 4747 references in the search, and included 20 randomised controlled trials of lung volume reduction involving 2794 participants with emphysema. Following lung volume reduction from any of the interventions in pooled analyses (ie, surgery, endobronchial valve, endobronchial coil, or sclerosing agents), the mean differences compared with the control were reduction in residual volume of 0·58 L (95% CI −0·80 to −0·37), increase in FEV1 of 15·87% (95% CI 12·27 to 19·47), improvement in 6MWT of 43·28 m (31·36 to 55·21), and reduction in the SGRQ of 9·33 points (−10·58 to −8·09). The odds ratio for a severe adverse event, which included mortality, was 6·21 (95% CI 4·02 to 9·58) following intervention. Regression analysis showed improvements relative to the degree of volume reduction: FEV1 (r2=0·86; p<0·0001), 6MWT (r2=0·77; p<0·0001), and SGRQ (r2=0·68; p<0·0001). Most studies were at high risk of bias for lack of blinding, and heterogeneity was high for some outcomes when pooled across all interventions, but was generally lower in the subgroups by intervention type.
Interpretation
Despite limitations of high risk of bias and heterogeneity for some analyses, our results provide support that lung volume reduction in patients with severe emphysema on maximal medical treatment has clinically meaningful benefits. These benefits should be considered alongside potential adverse events.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The paediatric early versus late parenteral nutrition in critical illness (PEPaNIC) multicentre, randomised, controlled trial showed that, compared with early parenteral nutrition, withholding supplemental parenteral nutrition for 1 week in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU; late parenteral nutrition) reduced infections and accelerated recovery from critical illness in children. We aimed to investigate the long-term impact on physical and neurocognitive development of early versus late parenteral nutrition.
Methods
In this preplanned 2-year follow-up study, all patients included in the PEPaNIC trial (which was done in University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium; Erasmus Medical Centre–Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, Netherlands; and Stollery Children's Hospital, Edmonton, AB, Canada) were approached for possible assessment of physical and neurocognitive development compared with healthy children who were matched for age and sex, and who had never been admitted to a neonatal ICU or a PICU. Assessed outcomes comprised anthropometric data; health status; parent-reported or caregiver-reported executive functions and emotional and behavioural problems; and tests for intelligence, visual–motor integration, alertness, motor coordination, inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility, and memory. To address partial responses among the children tested, we did multiple data imputation by chained equations before univariable and multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses adjusted for risk factors. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01536275.
Findings
At the 2-year follow-up, 60 (8%) of 717 children who received late parenteral nutrition and 63 (9%) of 723 children who received early parenteral nutrition had died (p=0·81). 68 (9%) of 717 children who received late and 91 (13%) of 723 children who received early parenteral nutrition were too disabled for neurocognitive assessment (p=0·059), and 786 patients (395 assigned to late and 391 assigned to early parenteral nutrition) consented for testing. 786 patients and 405 healthy control children underwent long-term outcome testing between Aug 4, 2014, and Jan 19, 2018, and were included in the imputation model for subsequent multivariable analyses. Late parenteral nutrition did not adversely affect anthropometric data, health status, or neurological functioning, and improved parent-reported or caregiver-reported executive functioning (late vs early parenteral nutrition β estimate −2·258, 95% CI −4·012 to −0·504; p=0·011), more specifically inhibition (−3·422, −5·171 to −1·673; p=0·0001), working memory (−2·016, −3·761 to −0·270; p=0·023), and meta-cognition (−1·957, −3·694 to −0·220; p=0·027). Externalising behavioural problems (β estimate −1·715, 95% CI −3·325 to −0·106; p=0·036) and visual–motor integration (0·468, 0·087 to 0·850; p=0·016) were also improved in the late parenteral nutrition group compared with the early parenteral nutrition group. After Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, the effect on inhibitory control remained significant (p=0·0001).
Interpretation
Withholding early parenteral nutrition for 1 week in the PICU did not negatively affect survival, anthropometrics, health status, and neurocognitive development, and improved inhibitory control 2 years after PICU admission.

abstract = "Summary
Background
In patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, lung infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa is associated with frequent pulmonary exacerbations and admission to hospital for treatment, reduced quality of life, and increased mortality. Although inhaled antibiotics are conditionally recommended for long-term management of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis with frequent exacerbations, there is no approved therapy. We investigated the safety and efficacy of inhaled liposomal ciprofloxacin (ARD-3150) in two phase 3 trials.
Methods
ORBIT-3 and ORBIT-4 were international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials run concurrently in similar geographical regions. Eligible patients had non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, had had at least two pulmonary exacerbations treated with antibiotics in the previous 12 months, and had a history of chronic P aeruginosa lung infection. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either ARD-3150 or placebo. ARD-3150 (3 mL liposome encapsulated ciprofloxacin 135 mg and 3 mL free ciprofloxacin 54 mg) or 6 mL placebo (3 mL dilute empty liposomes mixed with 3 mL of saline) was self-administered once daily for six 56-day treatment cycles, for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was time to first pulmonary exacerbation from the date of randomisation to week 48. We did primary and secondary efficacy, safety, and microbiology analyses on the full analysis population, which comprised all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study drug. ORBIT-3 and ORBIT-4 are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT01515007 and NCT02104245, respectively.
Findings
Between March 31, 2014, and Aug 19, 2015, we screened 514 patients in ORBIT-3 and 533 patients in ORBIT-4. The full analysis populations consisted of 278 patients in ORBIT-3 (183 patients received at least one dose of ARD-3150 and 95 received placebo) and 304 patients in ORBIT-4 (206 patients received at least one dose of ARD-3150 and 98 received placebo). In ORBIT-4, the median time to first pulmonary exacerbation was 230 days in the ARD-3150 group compared with 158 days in the placebo group, a statistically significant difference of 72 days (hazard ratio [HR] 0·72 [95% CI 0·53–0·97], p=0·032). In ORBIT-3, the median time to first pulmonary exacerbation was 214 days in the ARD-3150 group and 136 days in the placebo group, a non-statistically significant difference of 78 days (HR 0·99 [95% CI 0·71–1·38], p=0·97). In a pooled analysis of data from both ORBIT-3 and ORBIT-4, the median time to first pulmonary exacerbation was 222 days in the ARD-3150 group and 157 days in the placebo group, a non-statistically significant difference of 65 days (0·82 [0·65–1·02], p=0·074). The numbers of adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in both groups in ORBIT-3 and ORBIT-4.
Interpretation
In patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and chronic P aeruginosa lung infection requiring antibiotic therapy in the preceding year, ARD-3150 led to a significantly longer median time to first pulmonary exacerbation compared with placebo in ORBIT-4, but not in ORBIT-3 or the pooled analysis. Inconsistency between the trials suggests further research is needed into the heterogeneity of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and optimal outcome measures for inhaled antibiotics.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Detection of EGFR mutations in tumour tissue is the gold-standard approach to ascertain if a patient will benefit from treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. However, if tissue is scant, another strategy is to use circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA), but this method needs validation in clinical trials. We did a prospective clinical trial to assess ctDNA-based EGFR mutation detection as a selection criterion for patients with lung adenocarcinoma receiving gefitinib as first-line treatment.
Methods
BENEFIT is a multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 clinical trial at 15 centres in China. Patients aged 18–75 years with stage IV metastatic lung adenocarcinoma and EGFR mutations detected in ctDNA were given oral gefitinib 250 mg once daily as first-line treatment. The primary endpoint was the proportion achieving an objective response. Secondary endpoints included median progression-free survival and safety. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of a 168-gene panel was used for genetic analysis of baseline blood samples. The primary efficacy analysis was done by intention to treat in patients who had at least one post-baseline tumour assessment. The safety analysis was done in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02282267.
Findings
Between Dec 25, 2014, and Jan 16, 2016, 426 patients were screened for the trial, of whom 188 with EGFR mutations in ctDNA were enrolled and received gefitinib. 183 patients had one or more post-baseline tumour assessment and were included in the primary efficacy analysis. Median follow-up was 14·5 months (IQR 12·2–16·5). At the time of data cutoff (Jan 31, 2017), 152 patients had progressive disease or had died. The proportion achieving an objective response was 72·1% (95% CI 65·0–78·5). Median progression-free survival was 9·5 months (95% CI 9·07–11·04). Of 167 patients with available blood samples, 147 (88%) showed clearance of EGFR mutations in ctDNA at week 8, and median progression-free survival was longer for these patients than for the 20 patients whose EGFR mutations persisted at week 8 (11·0 months [95% CI 9·43–12·85] vs 2·1 months [1·81–3·65]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·14, 95% CI 0·08–0·23; p<0·0001). From baseline NGS data in 179 patients, we identified three subgroups of patients: those with EGFR mutations only (n=58), those with mutations in EGFR and tumour-suppressor genes (n=97), and those with mutations in EGFR and oncogenes (n=24). Corresponding median progression-free survival in these subgroups was 13·2 months (95% CI 11·5–15·0), 9·3 months (7·6–11·0), and 4·7 months (1·9–9·3), respectively (EGFR mutations only vs mutations in EGFR and tumour-suppressor genes, HR 1·78, 95% CI 1·23–2·58; p=0·002; EGFR mutations only vs mutations in EGFR and oncogenes, 2·66, 1·58–4·49; p=0·0003). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were hepatic function abnormalities (n=24). Serious adverse events were reported in 17 (9%) patients. No unexpected safety events for gefitinib were recorded.
Interpretation
Detection of EGFR mutations in ctDNA is an effective method to identify patients who might benefit from first-line gefitinib treatment. Further analyses of dynamic alterations of EGFR mutations and accompanying gene aberrances could predict resistance to gefitinib.

Background
Benralizumab is an interleukin-5 receptor α-directed cytolytic monoclonal antibody that has been shown to safely reduce exacerbations and improve lung function for patients with asthma. We assessed the long-term safety and efficacy of benralizumab for patients with severe, uncontrolled eosinophilic asthma.
Methods
We conducted a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3 extension study at 447 sites in 24 countries. Eligible patients had to have completed the SIROCCO or CALIMA trials and remained on subcutaneous benralizumab 30 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) or every 8 weeks (Q8W). Patients who had received placebo in those trials were re-randomised in a 1:1 ratio, using an interactive web-based system, to benralizumab 30 mg either Q4W or Q8W (first three doses 4 weeks apart). Treatment lasted for 56 weeks for adult patients (age ≥18 years) and 108 weeks for adolescent patients (age 12–17 years). The primary endpoint was the safety and tolerability of the two dosing regimens of benralizumab up to 68 weeks for adult patients (including the follow-up visit post-treatment) and up to 56 weeks for adolescent patients. This endpoint was assessed in the full analysis set, which included all patients from the SIROCCO and CALIMA predecessor studies who received at least one dose of study treatment in BORA and did not continue into another trial. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02258542).
Findings
Between Nov 19, 2014, and July 6, 2016, we enrolled 1926 patients, of whom 633 had received benralizumab Q4W and 639 had received benralizumab Q8W in SIROCCO or CALIMA. The remaining 654 patients had received placebo in those trials and were randomly re-assigned in this trial to receive benralizumab Q4W (n=320) or Q8W (n=334). 1576 patients, including 783 who received benralizumab Q4W (265 newly assigned) and 793 who received benralizumab Q8W (281 newly assigned), were included in the full analysis set. The most common adverse events in all groups were viral upper respiratory tract infection (14–16%) and worsening asthma (7–10%). The most common serious adverse events were worsening asthma (3–4%), pneumonia (<1% to 1%), and pneumonia caused by bacterial infection (0–1%). The percentages of patients who had any on-treatment adverse event, any serious adverse event, or any adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation during BORA were similar between patients originally assigned benralizumab and those originally assigned placebo and between benralizumab treatment regimens. The percentage of patients who had any adverse event was similar between SIROCCO or CALIMA (71–75%; benralizumab group only) and BORA (65–71%), as was the percentage of patients who had an adverse event that led to treatment discontinuation (2% in SIROCCO and CALIMA vs 2–3% in BORA).
Interpretation
The 2 years of safety results validate that observations observed in the first year of benralizumab continued through a second year of treatment. No new consequences of long-term eosinophil depletion occurred, and the incidence of other adverse events, including opportunistic infections, were similar during the second year.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Abnormal acid gastro-oesophageal reflux (GER) is hypothesised to play a role in progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We aimed to determine whether treatment of abnormal acid GER with laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery reduces the rate of disease progression.
Methods
The WRAP-IPF trial was a randomised controlled trial of laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery in patients with IPF and abnormal acid GER recruited from six academic centres in the USA. We enrolled patients with IPF, abnormal acid GER (DeMeester score of ≥14·7; measured by 24-h pH monitoring) and preserved forced vital capacity (FVC). We excluded patients with a FVC below 50% predicted, a FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 0·65, a history of acute respiratory illness in the past 12 weeks, a body-mass index greater than 35, and known severe pulmonary hypertension. Concomitant therapy with nintedanib and pirfenidone was allowed. The primary endpoint was change in FVC from randomisation to week 48, in the intention-to-treat population with mixed-effects models for repeated measures. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01982968.
Findings
Between June 1, 2014, and Sept 30, 2016, we screened 72 patients and randomly assigned 58 patients to receive surgery (n=29) or no surgery (n=29). 27 patients in the surgery group and 20 patients in the no surgery group had an FVC measurement at 48 weeks (p=0·041). Intention-to-treat analysis adjusted for baseline anti-fibrotic use demonstrated the adjusted rate of change in FVC over 48 weeks was −0·05 L (95% CI −0·15 to 0·05) in the surgery group and −0·13 L (−0·23 to −0·02) in the non-surgery group (p=0·28). Acute exacerbation, respiratory-related hospitalisation, and death was less common in the surgery group without statistical significance. Dysphagia (eight [29%] of 28) and abdominal distention (four [14%] of 28) were the most common adverse events after surgery. There was one death in the surgery group and four deaths in the non-surgery group.
Interpretation
Laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery in patients with IPF and abnormal acid GER is safe and well tolerated. A larger, well powered, randomised controlled study of anti-reflux surgery is needed in this population.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Treatment with bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) has shown benefits in preclinical models of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Safety has not been established for administration of MSCs in critically ill patients with ARDS. We did a phase 2a trial to assess safety after administration of MSCs to patients with moderate to severe ARDS.
Methods
We did a prospective, double-blind, multicentre, randomised trial to assess treatment with one intravenous dose of MSCs compared with placebo. We recruited ventilated patients with moderate to severe ARDS (ratio of partial pressure of oxygen to fractional inspired oxygen <27 kPa and positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP] ≥8 cm H2O) in five university medical centres in the USA. Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive either 10 × 106/kg predicted bodyweight MSCs or placebo, according to a computer-generated schedule with a variable block design and stratified by site. We excluded patients younger than 18 years, those with trauma or moderate to severe liver disease, and those who had received cancer treatment in the previous 2 years. The primary endpoint was safety and all analyses were done by intention to treat. We also measured biomarkers in plasma. MSC viability was tested in a post-hoc analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02097641.
Findings
From March 24, 2014, to Feb 9, 2017 we screened 1038 patients, of whom 60 were eligible for and received treatment. No patient experienced any of the predefined MSC-related haemodynamic or respiratory adverse events. One patient in the MSC group died within 24 h of MSC infusion, but death was judged to be probably unrelated. 28-day mortality did not differ between the groups (30% in the MSC group vs 15% in the placebo group, odds ratio 2·4, 95% CI 0·5–15·1). At baseline, the MSC group had numerically higher mean scores than the placebo group for Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III (APACHE III; 104 [SD 31] vs 89 [33]), minute ventilation (11·1 [3·2] vs 9·6 [2·4] L/min), and PEEP (12·4 [3·7] vs 10·8 [2·6] cm H2O). After adjustment for APACHE III score, the hazard ratio for mortality at 28 days was 1·43 (95% CI 0·40–5·12, p=0·58). Viability of MSCs ranged from 36% to 85%.
Interpretation
One dose of intravenous MSCs was safe in patients with moderate to severe ARDS. Larger trials are needed to assess efficacy, and the viability of MSCs must be improved.

Background
Although the burden of influenza is often discussed in the context of historical pandemics and the threat of future pandemics, every year a substantial burden of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) and other respiratory conditions (like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) are attributable to seasonal influenza. The Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2017 is a systematic scientific effort to quantify the health loss associated with a comprehensive set of diseases and disabilities. In this Article, we focus on LRTIs that can be attributed to influenza.
Methods
We modelled the LRTI incidence, hospitalisations, and mortality attributable to influenza for every country and selected subnational locations by age and year from 1990 to 2017 as part of GBD 2017. We used a counterfactual approach that first estimated the LRTI incidence, hospitalisations, and mortality and then attributed a fraction of those outcomes to influenza.
Findings
Influenza LRTI was responsible for an estimated 145 000 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 99 000–200 000) deaths among all ages in 2017. The influenza LRTI mortality rate was highest among adults older than 70 years (16·4 deaths per 100 000 [95% UI 11·6–21·9]), and the highest rate among all ages was in eastern Europe (5·2 per 100 000 population [95% UI 3·5–7·2]). We estimated that influenza LRTIs accounted for 9 459 000 (95% UI 3 709 000–22 935 000) hospitalisations due to LRTIs and 81 536 000 hospital days (24 330 000–259 851 000). We estimated that 11·5% (95% UI 10·0–12·9) of LRTI episodes were attributable to influenza, corresponding to 54 481 000 (38 465 000–73 864 000) episodes and 8 172 000 severe episodes (5 000 000–13 296 000).
Interpretation
This comprehensive assessment of the burden of influenza LRTIs shows the substantial annual effect of influenza on global health. Although preparedness planning will be important for potential pandemics, health loss due to seasonal influenza LRTIs should not be overlooked, and vaccine use should be considered. Efforts to improve influenza prevention measures are needed.

Non-invasive ventilation is standard therapy in the management of both hypoxaemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure of various causes. The evidence base for its use and when and how it should be used has been reviewed in two recent guidelines. In this Series paper, we look beyond the guidelines to what is happening in everyday clinical practice in the real world, how patient selection can be refined to maximise the chances of a successful outcome, and emerging alternative therapies. Real-world application of non-invasive ventilation diverges from guideline recommendations, particularly with regard to patient selection and timing of initiation. To improve patient outcomes education programmes need to stress these issues and the effectiveness of non-invasive ventilation that is delivered needs to be monitored by regular audit."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Single-drug checkpoint inhibition has shown efficacy in patients with recurrent malignant pleural mesothelioma. Here, we assessed the safety and efficacy of the combination of nivolumab, an anti-programmed cell death 1 antibody, plus ipilimumab, an anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte protein 4 antibody, in patients with previously treated and relapsed malignant pleural mesothelioma.
Methods
INITIATE was a prospective single-centre, single arm, phase 2 trial. Patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma who progressed after at least one line of platinum-containing chemotherapy were enrolled. Key eligibility criteria were measurable disease according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours for mesotheliomas, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, and adequate organ function. Patients received intravenous nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks) plus intravenous ipilimumab (1 mg/kg every 6 weeks up to four times). Treatment was continued for up to 2 years or until confirmed progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was disease control at 12 weeks. All patients who received at least one dose of therapy were included in safety analysis and all patients who received one dose of therapy and at least one radiological assessment were included in the primary analysis. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03048474.
Findings
Between Oct 5, 2016, and Aug 3, 2017, 38 patients were enrolled in the study, of which two patients were excluded because they were not eligible for a biopsy. Of 36 eligible patients, one deteriorated before the start of the study so was not included in any analyses and one withdrew consent after one treatment cycle before radiological assessment so was included in the safety population only. 34 patients were evaluable for response assessment at 12 weeks. Of these, ten (29%) patients had a partial response and 13 (38%) patients had stable disease; thus, disease control was achieved by 23 (68%, 95% CI 50–83) of 34 patients. Treatment-related adverse events were reported in 33 (94%) patients. The most common adverse events were infusion-related reactions, skin disorders, and fatigue. Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events were reported in 12 (34%) of 35 patients.
Interpretation
In this single-centre phase 2 trial, the combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab showed marked efficacy in patients with recurrent malignant pleural mesothelioma. The safety profile was consistent with known data on the combination regimen. Our results warrant further investigation of this combination in a phase 3 trial.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive lung disease with a poor prognosis. Lung transplantation is the only intervention shown to increase life expectancy for patients with IPF, but it is associated with disease-specific challenges. In this Review, we discuss the importance of a proactive approach to the management of IPF comorbidities, including gastro-oesophageal reflux, pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease, and malignancy. With a donor pool too small to meet demand and unacceptably high mortality on transplant waiting lists, we discuss different systems used internationally to facilitate organ allocation. We explore the rapidly evolving landscape of transplantation for patients with IPF with regards to antifibrotic therapy, technological advances in extracorporeal life support, advances in understanding of the genetics of the disease, and the importance of a holistic multidisciplinary approach to care. Finally, we consider potential advances over the next decade that are envisaged to improve transplantation outcomes in patients with advanced IPF."

abstract = "Summary
Background
In patients with non-expandable lung, removal of pleural fluid can result in excessively negative pleural pressure, which is associated with chest discomfort, pneumothorax, and re-expansion pulmonary oedema. Pleural manometry is widely used to safeguard against pressure-related complications during thoracentesis despite little evidence to support the approach. We investigated whether monitoring of pleural pressure with manometry during thoracentesis could protect against complications compared with assessment of symptoms alone.
Methods
We did a prospective randomised single-blind trial involving patients with large pleural effusions at two academic medical centres in, Nashville, TN, and Baltimore, MD, USA. Eligible patients were adults with free-flowing effusions estimated to be at least 0·5 L who could remain seated throughout the procedure. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive thoracentesis guided by symptoms only (control) or by symptoms plus manometry at timepoints based on volume drained. The randomisation schedule was computer generated, used permuted blocks of four and six, and was stratified by participating institution. Patients, who were masked to study-group assignment, were asked to rate chest discomfort on 100 mm visual analogue scales before, during, and after drainage. In both groups drainage was discontinued before complete evacuation of pleural fluid if patients developed persistent chest discomfort, intractable cough, or other complications. In the manometry group, an additional criterion for stopping was if end-expiratory pleural pressure was lower than −20 cm H2O or declined by more than 10 cm H2O between two measurements to a value less than or equal to −10 cm H2O. The primary outcome was overall chest discomfort from before the start to after the procedure measured by patients 5 min after the end of drainage. Analysis was by modified intention to treat (ie, included all patients with any procedure or outcome data). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02677883.
Findings
Between March 4, 2016, and Sept 8, 2017, 191 patients were screened, of whom 128 were randomly assigned treatment and 124 were included in the final analysis (62 in each group). Four patients were excluded because of manometer malfunction (n=2), inability to access effusion due to pleural tumour burden (n=1), and inability to remain seated (n=1). Groups did not differ for the primary outcome (mean difference in chest discomfort score 2·4 mm, 95% CI −5·7 to 10·5, p=0·56). Six (10%) of 62 patients in the control group had asymptomatic pneumothorax ex vacuo compared with none in the manometry group (p=0·01). No serious complications occurred in either group.
Interpretation
Measurement of pleural pressure by manometry during large-volume thoracentesis does not alter procedure-related chest discomfort. Our findings do not support the routine use of this approach.

The periextubation period represents a crucial moment in the management of critically ill patients. Extubation failure, defined as the need for reintubation within 2–7 days after a planned extubation, is associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation, increased incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia, longer intensive care unit and hospital stays, and increased mortality. Conventional oxygen therapy is commonly used after extubation. Additional methods of non-invasive respiratory support, such as non-invasive ventilation and high-flow nasal therapy, can be used to avoid reintubation. The aim of this Review is to describe the pathophysiological mechanisms of postextubation respiratory failure and the available techniques and strategies of respiratory support to avoid reintubation. We summarise and discuss the available evidence supporting the use of these strategies to achieve a tailored therapy for an individual patient at the bedside."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Results from retrospective studies suggest that use of neuromuscular blocking agents during general anaesthesia might be linked to postoperative pulmonary complications. We therefore aimed to assess whether the use of neuromuscular blocking agents is associated with postoperative pulmonary complications.
Methods
We did a multicentre, prospective observational cohort study. Patients were recruited from 211 hospitals in 28 European countries. We included patients (aged ≥18 years) who received general anaesthesia for any in-hospital procedure except cardiac surgery. Patient characteristics, surgical and anaesthetic details, and chart review at discharge were prospectively collected over 2 weeks. Additionally, each patient underwent postoperative physical examination within 3 days of surgery to check for adverse pulmonary events. The study outcome was the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications from the end of surgery up to postoperative day 28. Logistic regression analyses were adjusted for surgical factors and patients' preoperative physical status, providing adjusted odds ratios (ORadj) and adjusted absolute risk reduction (ARRadj). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01865513.
Findings
Between June 16, 2014, and April 29, 2015, data from 22 803 patients were collected. The use of neuromuscular blocking agents was associated with an increased incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications in patients who had undergone general anaesthesia (1658 [7·6%] of 21 694); ORadj 1·86, 95% CI 1·53–2·26; ARRadj −4·4%, 95% CI −5·5 to −3·2). Only 2·3% of high-risk surgical patients and those with adverse respiratory profiles were anaesthetised without neuromuscular blocking agents. The use of neuromuscular monitoring (ORadj 1·31, 95% CI 1·15–1·49; ARRadj −2·6%, 95% CI −3·9 to −1·4) and the administration of reversal agents (1·23, 1·07–1·41; −1·9%, −3·2 to −0·7) were not associated with a decreased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. Neither the choice of sugammadex instead of neostigmine for reversal (ORadj 1·03, 95% CI 0·85–1·25; ARRadj −0·3%, 95% CI −2·4 to 1·5) nor extubation at a train-of-four ratio of 0·9 or more (1·03, 0·82–1·31; −0·4%, −3·5 to 2·2) was associated with better pulmonary outcomes.
Interpretation
We showed that the use of neuromuscular blocking drugs in general anaesthesia is associated with an increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. Anaesthetists must balance the potential benefits of neuromuscular blockade against the increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications.

abstract = "Summary
Background
China is the world's largest consumer of tobacco and has a large smoking-related chronic disease burden. In this nationwide study, we aimed to evaluate smoking prevalence and its implication on chronic diseases in the Chinese population.
Methods
We collected data from serial cross-sectional National Health Service Surveys done in China in 2003, 2008, and 2013. These surveys cover all 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China, and use multistage stratified cluster sampling. We divided mainland China into east, central, and west regions and then sampled counties from each region stratified by urban and rural areas. All respondents aged 15 years or older in the selected households were eligible. We analysed the variation in smoking prevalence from 2003 to 2013, further identified risk factors for smoking, and assessed the association between smoking and chronic diseases by using multiple logistic regression.
Findings
The number of individuals interviewed and involved in the study was 153 450 in 2003, 145 223 in 2008, and 229 676 in 2013. The standardised smoking prevalence in China was consistently high, with a proportion of current smokers of 26·0% (95% CI 25·8–26·2) in 2003, 24·9% (24·8–25·1) in 2008, and 25·2% (25·1–25·4) in 2013 (p value for trend 0·5062). For men, prevalence was 48·4% (48·1–48·7) in 2003, 47·0% (46·6–47·4) in 2008, and 47·2% (46·9–47·5) in 2013. For women, prevalence was 3·1% (3·0–3·2) in 2003, 2·3% (2·2–2·5) in 2008, and 2·7% (2·6–2·8) in 2013. Smoking prevalence varied in different regions, and we identified four major patterns. While a consistently high proportion of Chinese men smoked, the standardised smoking prevalence in women younger than 40 years increased from 1·0% in 2003 to 1·6% in 2013. Moreover, the smoking prevalence among adolescent smokers aged 15–24 years increased from 8·3% in 2003 to 12·5% in 2013. Alcohol consumption was closely linked to smoking in adolescents (odds ratio 7·5, 95% CI 6·9–8·1). Risk factors for adolescent smoking were having older family members who smoke (1·9, 1·8–1·9) and low level education (1·3, 1·2–1·4). Increased risks of chronic diseases were related to smoking (1·1, 1·0–1·1), with higher risks related to early smoking initiation (1·1, 1·0–1·1) and long-term smoking (1·2, 1·2–1·3).
Interpretation
The implementation of tobacco control policies in China since the signing of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in 2003 has not been effective in reducing smoking prevalence. Smoking prevalence among adolescents of both genders has increased substantially and there has been a steady increase among young women. More practical and effective policies targeting adolescents and women are urgently needed. Action is needed to prevent the large and growing smoking-related chronic disease burden further increasing as China's population ages.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in adults with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome has increased in the past 10 years. However, the efficacy of venovenous ECMO in people with acute respiratory distress syndrome is uncertain according to the most recent data. We aimed to estimate the effect of venovenous ECMO on mortality from acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Methods
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE (including MEDLINE In-Process and Epub Ahead of Print), Embase and the Wiley search platform in the Cochrane database for randomised controlled trials and observational studies with matching of conventional mechanical ventilation with and without venovenous ECMO in adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Titles, abstracts, and full-text articles were screened in duplicate by two investigators. Data for study design, patient characteristics, interventions, and study outcomes were abstracted independently and in duplicate. Studies were weighted with the inverse variance method and data were pooled via random-effects modelling. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs to summarise results. The primary outcome was 60-day mortality across randomised controlled trials. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines were used to rate the quality of evidence
Findings
We included five studies, two randomised controlled trials and three observational studies with matching techniques (total N=773 patients). In the primary analysis, which included two randomised controlled trials with a total population of 429 patients, 60-day mortality was significantly lower in the venovenous ECMO group than in the control group (73 [34%] of 214 vs 101 [47%] of 215; RR 0·73 [95% CI 0·58–0·92]; p=0·008; I2 0%). The GRADE level of evidence for this outcome was moderate. Three studies included data for the incidence of major haemorrhage in the ECMO group. 48 (19%) of the 251 patients in these three studies had major haemorrhages.
Interpretation
Compared with conventional mechanical ventilation, use of venovenous ECMO in adults with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome was associated with reduced 60-day mortality. However, venovenous ECMO was also associated with a moderate risk of major bleeding. These findings have important implications surrounding decision making for management of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome at centres providing venovenous ECMO.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Inhaled corticosteroids have been used in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but the potential benefits of their use in triple therapy are not well known. We aimed to compare the efficacy of a triple therapy with corresponding dual therapies in symptomatic patients with moderate to very severe COPD, without a requirement for a history of exacerbations.
Methods
In this double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre phase 3 randomised controlled trial, we recruited patients from hospitals and care centres in Canada, China, Japan, and the USA. Eligible patients were 40–80 years of age, were current or former smokers (with a smoking history of ≥10 pack-years), had an established clinical history of COPD, and were symptomatic for COPD, despite receiving two or more inhaled maintenance therapies for at least 6 weeks before screening. We randomly assigned patients (2:2:1:1) using an interactive web response system to receive budesonide/glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate metered-dose inhaler 320/18/9·6 μg (BGF MDI), glycopyrrolate/ formoterol fumarate metered-dose inhaler 18/9·6 μg (GFF MDI), budesonide/formoterol fumarate metered-dose inhaler 320/9·6 μg (BFF MDI), or open-label budesonide/formoterol fumarate dry-powder inhaler 400/12 μg (BUD/ FORM DPI). Primary endpoints for the Europe/Canada statistical analysis approach were FEV1 area under the curve from 0–4 h (AUC0–4) for BGF MDI versus BFF MDI and BGF MDI versus BUD/FORM DPI over 24 weeks; and change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV1 for BGF MDI versus GFF MDI and non-inferiority of BFF MDI versus BUD/FORM DPI (margin of −50 mL from lower bound of 95% CI) over 24 weeks. Comparisons with BUD/FORM DPI were made for the Europe/Canada statistical analysis approach only. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02497001.
Findings
Between Aug 20, 2015, and Jan 5, 2018, 3047 patients were screened from 215 sites, and 1902 were randomly assigned to receive BGF MDI (n=640), GFF MDI (n=627), BFF MDI (n=316), or BUD/FORM DPI (n=319). Over 24 weeks, BGF MDI significantly improved FEV1 AUC0–4 versus BFF MDI (least squares mean difference 104 mL, 95% CI 77 to 131; p<0·0001) and BUD/FORM DPI (91 mL, 64 to 117; p<0·0001). BGF MDI also significantly improved pre-dose trough FEV1 versus GFF MDI (22 mL, 4 to 39; p=0·0139) and BFF MDI was non-inferior to BUD/FORM DPI (−10 mL, −36 to 16; p=0·4390). At week 24, patients in the BGF MDI group had a significantly improved FEV1 AUC0–4 compared with patients receiving BFF MDI (116 mL, 95% CI 80 to 152; p<0·0001); there was a non-significant improvement in the change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV1 at week 24 versus GFF MDI (13 mL, −9 to 36 mL; p=0·2375). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were nasopharyngitis (n=49 [8%] in the BGF MDI group; n=41 [7%] in the GFF MDI group; n=26 [8%] in the BFF MDI group; and n=30 [9%] in the BUD/FORM DPI group) and upper respiratory tract infection (n=65 [10%]; n=38 [6%]; n=18 [6%]; and n=22 [7%]). Pneumonia incidence was low (<2%) and similar across treatments. There were two treatment-related deaths, both in the GFF MDI group.
Interpretation
BGF MDI was efficacious, well tolerated, and could be a more appropriate treatment than the corresponding dual therapies for symptomatic patients with moderate to very severe COPD, irrespective of exacerbation history.

Background
Precision medicine approaches that target patients on the basis of disease subtype have transformed treatment approaches to cancer, asthma, and other heterogeneous syndromes. Two distinct subphenotypes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have been identified in three US-based clinical trials, and these subphenotypes respond differently to positive end-expiratory pressure and fluid management. We aimed to investigate whether these subphenotypes exist in non-US patient populations and respond differently to pharmacotherapies.
Methods
HARP-2 was a multicentre, randomised controlled trial of simvastatin (80 mg) versus placebo done in general intensive care units (ICUs) at 40 hospitals in the UK and Ireland within 48 h of onset of ARDS. The primary outcome was ventilator-free days, and secondary outcomes included non-pulmonary organ failure-free days and mortality. In a secondary analysis of HARP-2, we applied latent class analysis to baseline data without consideration of outcomes to identify subphenotypes, and we compared clinical outcomes across subphenotypes and treatment groups.
Findings
540 patients were recruited to HARP-2. One patient withdrew consent for the use of their data, so data from 539 patients were analysed. In our secondary analysis, a two-class (two subphenotype) model was an improvement over a one-class model (p<0·0001), with 353 (65%) patients in the hypoinflammatory subphenotype group and 186 (35%) in the hyperinflammatory subphenotype group. Additional classes did not improve model fit. Clinical and biological characteristics of the two subphenotypes were similar to previous studies. Patients with the hyperinflammatory subphenotype had fewer ventilator-free days (median 2 days [IQR 0–17] vs 18 [IQR 0–23]; p<0·0001), fewer non-pulmonary organ failure-free days (15 [0–25] vs 27 [21–28]; p<0·0001), and higher 28-day mortality (73 [39%] vs 59 [17%]; p<0·0001) than did those with the hypoinflammatory subphenotype. Although HARP-2 found no difference in 28-day survival between placebo and simvastatin, significantly different survival was identified across patients stratified by treatment and subphenotype (p<0·0001). Specifically, within the hyperinflammatory subphenotype, patients treated with simvastatin had significantly higher 28-day survival than did those given placebo (p=0·008). A similar pattern was observed for 90-day survival.
Interpretation
Two subphenotypes of ARDS were identified in the HARP-2 cohort, with distinct clinical and biological features and disparate clinical outcomes. The hyperinflammatory subphenotype had improved survival with simvastatin compared with placebo. These findings support further pursuit of predictive enrichment strategies in critical care clinical trials.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Small airways dysfunction (SAD) is well recognised in asthma, yet its role in the severity and control of asthma is unclear. This study aimed to assess which combination of biomarkers, physiological tests, and imaging markers best measure the presence and extent of SAD in patients with asthma.
Methods
In this baseline assessment of a multinational prospective cohort study (the Assessment of Small Airways Involvement in Asthma [ATLANTIS] study), we recruited participants with and without asthma (defined as Global Initiative for Asthma severity stages 1–5) from general practices, the databases of chest physicians, and advertisements at 29 centres across nine countries (Brazil, China, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, the UK, the USA, and Canada). All participants were aged 18–65 years, and participants with asthma had received a clinical diagnosis of asthma more than 6 months ago that had been confirmed by a chest physician. This diagnosis required support by objective evidence at baseline or during the past 5 years, which could be: positive airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine, positive reversibility (a change in FEV1 ≥12% and ≥200 mL within 30 min) after treatment with 400 μg of salbutamol in a metered-dose inhaler with or without a spacer, variability in peak expiratory flow of more than 20% (measured over 7 days), or documented reversibility after a cycle (eg, 4 weeks) of maintenance anti-asthma treatment. The inclusion criteria also required that patients had stable asthma on any previous regular asthma treatment (including so-called rescue β2-agonists alone) at a stable dose for more than 8 weeks before baseline and had smoked for a maximum of 10 pack-years in their lifetime. Control group participants were recruited by advertisements; these participants were aged 18–65 years, had no respiratory symptoms compatible with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, normal spirometry, and normal airways responsiveness, and had smoked for a maximum of 10 pack-years. We assessed all participants with spirometry, body plethysmography, impulse oscillometry, multiple breath nitrogen washout, CT (in selected participants), and questionnaires about asthma control, asthma-related quality of life (both in participants with asthma only), and health status. We applied structural equation modelling in participants with asthma to assess the contribution of all physiological and CT variables to SAD, from which we defined clinical SAD and CT SAD scores. We then classified patients with asthma into SAD groups with model-based clustering, and we compared asthma severity, control, and health-care use during the past year by SAD score and by SAD group. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02123667.
Findings
Between June 30, 2014, and March 3, 2017, we recruited and evaluated 773 participants with asthma and 99 control participants. All physiological measures contributed to the clinical SAD model with the structural equation modelling analysis. The prevalence of SAD in asthma was dependent on the measure used; we found the lowest prevalence of SAD associated with acinar airway ventilation heterogeneity (Sacin), an outcome determined by multiple breath nitrogen washout that reflects ventilation heterogeneity in the most peripheral, pre-acinar or acinar airways. Impulse oscillometry and spirometry results, which were used to assess dysfunction of small-sized to mid-sized airways, contributed most to the clinical SAD score and differed between the two SAD groups. Participants in clinical SAD group 1 (n=452) had milder SAD than group 2 and comparable multiple breath nitrogen washout Sacin to control participants. Participants in clinical SAD group 2 (n=312) had abnormal physiological SAD results relative to group 1, particularly their impulse oscillometry and spirometry measurements, and group 2 participants also had more severe asthma (with regard to asthma control, treatments, exacerbations, and quality of life) than group 1. Clinical SAD scores were higher (indicating more severe SAD) in group 2 than group 1, and we found that these scores were related to asthma control, severity, and exacerbations. We found no correlation between clinical SAD and CT SAD scores.
Interpretation
SAD is a complex and silent signature of asthma that is likely to be directly or indirectly captured by combinations of physiological tests, such as spirometry, body plethysmography, impulse oscillometry, and multiple breath nitrogen washout. SAD is present across patients with all severities of asthma, but it is particularly prevalent in severe disease. The clinical classification of SAD into two groups (a milder and a more severe group) by use of impulse oscillometry and spirometry, which are easy to use, is meaningful given its association with GINA severity stages, asthma control, quality of life, and exacerbations.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis typically occurs in an immunocompromised host. For almost a century, influenza has been known to set up for bacterial superinfections, but recently patients with severe influenza were also reported to develop invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. We aimed to measure the incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis over several seasons in patients with influenza pneumonia in the intensive care unit (ICU) and to assess whether influenza was an independent risk factor for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.
Methods
We did a retrospective multicentre cohort study. Data were collected from adult patients with severe influenza admitted to seven ICUs across Belgium and The Netherlands during seven influenza seasons. Patients were older than 18 years, were admitted to the ICU for more than 24 h with acute respiratory failure, had pulmonary infiltrates on imaging, and a confirmed influenza infection based on a positive airway PCR test (influenza cohort). We used logistic regression analyses to determine if influenza was independently associated with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in non-immunocompromised (ie, no European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group [EORTC/MSG] host factor) influenza-positive patients (influenza case group) compared with non-immunocompromised patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia who had a negative airway influenza PCR test (control group).
Findings
Data were collected from patients admitted to the ICU between Jan 1, 2009, and June 30, 2016. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis was diagnosed in 83 (19%) of 432 patients admitted with influenza (influenza cohort), a median of 3 days after admission to the ICU. The incidence was similar for influenza A and B. For patients with influenza who were immunocompromised, incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis was as high as 32% (38 of 117 patients), whereas in the non-immunocompromised influenza case group, incidence was 14% (45 of 315 patients). Conversely, only 16 (5%) of 315 patients in the control group developed invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The 90-day mortality was 51% in patients in the influenza cohort with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and 28% in the influenza cohort without invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (p=0·0001). In this study, influenza was found to be independently associated with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (adjusted odds ratio 5·19; 95% CI 2·63–10·26; p<0·0001), along with a higher APACHE II score, male sex, and use of corticosteroids.
Interpretation
Influenza was identified as an independent risk factor for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and is associated with high mortality. Future studies should assess whether a faster diagnosis or antifungal prophylaxis could improve the outcome of influenza-associated aspergillosis.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The efficacy and safety of nintedanib, an intracellular tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis were assessed in two phase 3, placebo-controlled INPULSIS trials. Patients who completed the 52-week treatment period in an INPULSIS trial could receive open-label nintedanib in the extension trial, INPULSIS-ON. We aimed to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of nintedanib in INPULSIS-ON.
Methods
Patients who completed the 52-week treatment period of INPULSIS, and the follow-up visit 4 weeks later, were eligible for INPULSIS-ON. The off-treatment period between INPULSIS and INPULSIS-ON could be 4–12 weeks. Patients receiving nintedanib 150 mg twice daily or placebo at the end of an INPULSIS trial received nintedanib 150 mg twice daily in INPULSIS-ON. Patients receiving nintedanib 100 mg twice daily or placebo at the end of an INPULSIS trial could receive nintedanib 100 mg twice daily or 150 mg twice daily in INPULSIS-ON. Spirometric tests were done at baseline, at weeks 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and then every 16 weeks. The primary outcome of INPULSIS-ON was to characterise the long-term safety and tolerability of nintedanib in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and this was analysed in patients who received at least one dose of nintedanib in INPULSIS-ON. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01619085, and with EudraCT, number 2011-002766-21.
Findings
The first patient was enrolled into INPULSIS-ON in July 2, 2012. Of 807 patients who completed the INPULSIS trials, 734 (91%) were treated in INPULSIS-ON. 430 (59%) patients had received nintedanib in INPULSIS and continued nintedanib in INPULSIS-ON, and 304 (41%) had received placebo in INPULSIS and initiated nintedanib in INPULSIS-ON. Median exposure time for patients treated with nintedanib in both the INPULSIS and INPULSIS-ON trials was 44·7 months (range 11·9–68·3). The safety profile of nintedanib in INPULSIS-ON was consistent with that observed in INPULSIS. Diarrhoea was the most frequent adverse event in INPULSIS-ON (60·1 events per 100 patient exposure-years in patients who continued nintedanib, 71·2 events per 100 patient exposure-years in patients who initiated nintedanib). 20 (5%) of 430 patients who continued nintedanib and 31 (10%) of 304 patients who initiated nintedanib permanently discontinued nintedanib because of diarrhoea. The adverse event that most frequently led to permanent discontinuation of nintedanib was progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (51 [12%] patients continuing nintedanib and 43 [14%] patients initiating nintedanib). The event rate of bleeding was 8·4 events per 100 patient exposure-years in patients who continued nintedanib and 6·7 events per 100 patient exposure-years in patients who initiated nintedanib. The event rate of major adverse cardiovascular events was 3·6 events per 100 patient exposure-years in patients who continued nintedanib and 2·4 events per 100 patient exposure-years in patients who initiated nintedanib. The event rate of myocardial infarction using the broad scope (ie, all possible cases) was 1·3 events per 100 patient exposure-years in patients who continued nintedanib and 0·7 events per 100 patient exposure-years in patients who initiated nintedanib.
Interpretation
These findings suggest that nintedanib has a manageable safety and tolerability profile over long-term use, with no new safety signals. Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis could use nintedanib over the long-term to slow disease progression.

The normal lung function trajectory from birth to death has three phases: a growth phase (from birth to early adulthood), a plateau phase (that lasts for a few years), and a decline phase resulting from physiological lung ageing. Numerous genetic and environmental factors can alter one or more of these phases. Evidence shows that several lung function trajectories exist throughout the life course and, importantly, that some of them are associated with substantial implications for health and disease. Here, we review the evidence, formulate a series of questions, and identify various challenges that need to be addressed to identify potential opportunities to promote respiratory health."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Increased detection of small-sized, peripheral, non-small-cell lung cancer has renewed interest in sublobar resection instead of lobectomy, the traditional standard of care for early-stage lung cancer. We aimed to assess morbidity and mortality associated with lobar and sublobar resection for early-stage lung cancer.
Methods
CALGB/Alliance 140503 is a multicentre, international, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial in patients with peripheral non-small-cell lung cancer clinically staged as T1aN0. Patients were recruited from 69 academic and community-based institutions in Australia, Canada, and the USA. Patients were randomly assigned intraoperatively to either lobar or sublobar resection. The random assignment was based on permuted block randomisation without concealment and was stratified according to radiographic tumour size, histology, and smoking status. The primary endpoint of the trial is disease-free survival; here, we report a post-hoc, exploratory, comparative analysis of perioperative mortality and morbidity associated with lobar and sublobar resection. Perioperative mortality was defined as death from any cause within 30 days and 90 days of surgical intervention and was calculated for all randomised patients. Morbidity was graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis for randomised patients with data available. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00499330.
Findings
Between June 15, 2007, and March 13, 2017, 697 patients were randomly allocated to either lobar resection (n=357) or sublobar resection (n=340; 59% wedge resection). Six (0·9%) patients died by 30 days, four (1·1%) after lobar resection and two (0·6%) after sublobar resection; by 90 days, ten (1·4%) patients had died, six (1·7%) after lobar resection and four (1·2%) after sublobar resection (difference at 30 days, 0·5%, 95% CI −1·1 to 2·3; difference at 90 days, 0·5%, 95% CI −1·5 to 2·6). An adverse event of any grade occurred in 193 (54%) of 355 patients after lobar resection and 172 (51%) of 337 patients after sublobar resection. Adverse events of grade 3 or worse occurred in 54 (15%) patients assigned lobar resection and in 48 (14%) patients assigned sublobar resection. No differences between surgical approaches were noted in cardiac or pulmonary complications. Grade 3 haemorrhage (requiring transfusion) occurred in six (2%) patients assigned lobar resection and eight (2%) patients assigned sublobar resection. Prolonged air leak occurred in nine (3%) patients after lobar resection and two (1%) patients after sublobar resection.
Interpretation
Our post-hoc analysis showed that perioperative mortality and morbidity did not seem to differ between lobar and sublobar resection in physically and functionally fit patients with clinical T1aN0 non-small-cell lung cancer. These data may affect the daily choices made by patients and their doctors in establishing the best treatment approach for stage I lung cancer.

Background
Non-invasive ventilation has never been compared with high-flow oxygen to determine whether it reduces the risk of severe hypoxaemia during intubation. We aimed to determine if preoxygenation with non-invasive ventilation was more efficient than high-flow oxygen in reducing the risk of severe hypoxaemia during intubation.
Methods
The FLORALI-2 multicentre, open-label trial was done in 28 intensive care units in France. Adult patients undergoing tracheal intubation for acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure (a partial pressure of arterial oxygen [PaO2] to fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO2] ratio of ≤300 mm Hg) were randomly assigned (1:1; block size, four participants) to non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen during preoxygenation, with stratification by PaO2/FiO2 ratio (≤200 mm Hg vs >200 mm Hg). Key exclusion criteria were intubation for cardiac arrest, altered consciousness (defined as a Glasgow coma score of less than eight points), other contraindications to non-invasive ventilation (recent laryngeal, oesophageal, or gastric surgery, and substantial facial fractures), pulse oximetry not available, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and refusal to participate. The primary outcome was the occurrence of severe hypoxaemia (pulse oximetry <80%) during the procedure, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02668458.
Findings
Between April 15, 2016, and Jan 8, 2017, 2079 patients were intubated in the 28 participating units, and 322 were enrolled. We excluded five patients with no recorded data, two who withdrew consent or were under legal protection, one who was not intubated, and one who had a cardiac arrest. Of the 313 patients included in the intention-to-treat analysis, 142 were assigned to non-invasive ventilation and 171 to high-flow oxygen therapy. Severe hypoxaemia occurred in 33 (23%) of 142 patients after preoxygenation with non-invasive ventilation and 47 (27%) of 171 with high-flow oxygen (absolute difference −4·2%, 95% CI −13·7 to 5·5; p=0·39). In the 242 patients with moderate-to-severe hypoxaemia (PaO2/FiO2 ≤200 mm Hg), severe hypoxaemia occurred less frequently after preoxygenation with non-invasive ventilation than with high-flow oxygen (28 [24%] of 117 patients vs 44 [35%] of 125; adjusted odds ratio 0·56, 0·32 to 0·99, p=0·0459). Serious adverse events did not differ between treatment groups, with the most common immediate complications being systolic arterial hypotension (70 [49%] patients in the non-invasive ventilation group vs 86 [50%] patients in the high-flow oxygen group) and chest infiltrate on x-ray (28 [20%] vs 33 [19%]), and the most common late complications being death at day 28 (53 [37%] vs 58 [34%]) and ventilator-associated pneumonia during ICU stay (31 [22%] vs 35 [20%]).
Interpretation
In patients with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure, preoxygenation with non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen therapy did not change the risk of severe hypoxaemia. Future research should explore the effect of preoxygenation method in patients with moderate-to-severe hypoxaemia at baseline.

abstract = "Summary
As a result of technical improvements, extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R) now has the potential to play an important role in the management of adults with acute respiratory failure. There is growing interest in the use of ECCO2R for the management of both hypoxaemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure. However, evidence to support its use is scarce and several questions remain about the best way to implement this therapy, which can be associated with serious side-effects. This Review reflects the consensus opinion of an international group of clinician scientists with expertise in managing acute respiratory failure and in using ECCO2R therapies in this setting. We concisely review clinically relevant aspects of ECCO2R, and provide a series of recommendations for clinical practice and future research, covering topics that include the practicalities of ECCO2R delivery, indications for use, and service delivery."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The protection conferred by influenza vaccination is generally thought to last less than a year, necessitating annual revaccination. However, the speed with which influenza vaccine effectiveness might decline during a year is unknown, which is of particular importance for locations with year-round influenza activity. We aimed to assess how influenza vaccine effectiveness changes by time intervals between vaccination and admission to hospital, taking advantage of almost year-round circulation of influenza in Hong Kong.
Methods
In this test-negative case-control study, we analysed vaccine effectiveness in children (aged 6 months to 17 years) who were admitted to hospital in Hong Kong over 5 consecutive years (2012–17). We included those who were admitted to general wards in four public hospitals in Hong Kong with a fever (≥38°C) and any respiratory symptom, such as runny nose, cough, or sore throat. We used direct immunofluorescence assay and reverse transcription PCR to detect influenza virus infection, and recorded children's influenza immunisation history. We compared characteristics of positive cases and negative controls and examined how vaccine effectiveness changed by time between vaccination and admission to hospital with regression analyses.
Findings
Between Sept 1, 2012, and Aug 31, 2017, we enrolled 15 695 children hospitalised for respiratory infections, including 2500 (15·9%) who tested positive for influenza A or B and 13 195 (84·1%) who tested negative. 159 (6·4%) influenza-positive cases and 1445 (11·0%) influenza-negative cases had been vaccinated. Most vaccinations were done by December of each influenza vaccination season. Influenza-related admissions to hospital occurred year-round, with peaks in January through March in most years and a large summer peak in 2016; pooled vaccine effectiveness for children of all ages was 79% (95% CI 42–92) for September to December, 67% (57–74) for January to April, and 43% (25–57) for May to August. Vaccine effectiveness against influenza A or B was estimated as 79% (95% CI 64–88) within 0·5–2 months of vaccination, 60% (46–71) within >2–4 months, 57% (39–70) within >4–6 months, and 45% (22–61) within >6–9 months. In separate analyses by type and subtype, we estimated that vaccine effectiveness declined by 2–5 percentage points per month.
Interpretation
Influenza vaccine effectiveness decreased during the 9 months after vaccination in children in Hong Kong. Our findings confirm the importance of annual vaccination in children. Influenza vaccines that provide broader and longer-lasting protection are needed to provide year-round protection in regions with irregular influenza seasonality or lengthy periods of influenza activity.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Few genetic studies that focus on moderate-to-severe asthma exist. We aimed to identity novel genetic variants associated with moderate-to-severe asthma, see whether previously identified genetic variants for all types of asthma contribute to moderate-to-severe asthma, and provide novel mechanistic insights using expression analyses in patients with asthma.
Methods
In this genome-wide association study, we used a two-stage case-control design. In stage 1, we genotyped patient-level data from two UK cohorts (the Genetics of Asthma Severity and Phenotypes [GASP] initiative and the Unbiased BIOmarkers in PREDiction of respiratory disease outcomes [U-BIOPRED] project) and used data from the UK Biobank to collect patient-level genomic data for cases and controls of European ancestry in a 1:5 ratio. Cases were defined as having moderate-to-severe asthma if they were taking appropriate medication or had been diagnosed by a doctor. Controls were defined as not having asthma, rhinitis, eczema, allergy, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis as diagnosed by a doctor. For stage 2, an independent cohort of cases and controls (1:5) was selected from the UK Biobank only, with no overlap with stage 1 samples. In stage 1 we undertook a genome-wide association study of moderate-to-severe asthma, and in stage 2 we followed up independent variants that reached the significance threshold of p less than 1 × 10−6 in stage 1. We set genome-wide significance at p less than 5 × 10−8. For novel signals, we investigated their effect on all types of asthma (mild, moderate, and severe). For all signals meeting genome-wide significance, we investigated their effect on gene expression in patients with asthma and controls.
Findings
We included 5135 cases and 25 675 controls for stage 1, and 5414 cases and 21 471 controls for stage 2. We identified 24 genome-wide significant signals of association with moderate-to-severe asthma, including several signals in innate or adaptive immune-response genes. Three novel signals were identified: rs10905284 in GATA3 (coded allele A, odds ratio [OR] 0·90, 95% CI 0·88–0·93; p=1·76 × 10−10), rs11603634 in the MUC5AC region (coded allele G, OR 1·09, 1·06–1·12; p=2·32 × 10−8), and rs560026225 near KIAA1109 (coded allele GATT, OR 1·12, 1·08–1·16; p=3·06 × 10−9). The MUC5AC signal was not associated with asthma when analyses included mild asthma. The rs11603634 G allele was associated with increased expression of MUC5AC mRNA in bronchial epithelial brush samples via proxy SNP rs11602802; (p=2·50 × 10−5) and MUC5AC mRNA was increased in bronchial epithelial samples from patients with severe asthma (in two independent analyses, p=0·039 and p=0·022).
Interpretation
We found substantial shared genetic architecture between mild and moderate-to-severe asthma. We also report for the first time genetic variants associated with the risk of developing moderate-to-severe asthma that regulate mucin production. Finally, we identify candidate causal genes in these loci and provide increased insight into this difficult to treat population.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The large amount of clinical signals in intensive care units can easily overwhelm health-care personnel and can lead to treatment delays, suboptimal care, or clinical errors. The aim of this study was to apply deep machine learning methods to predict severe complications during critical care in real time after cardiothoracic surgery.
Methods
We used deep learning methods (recurrent neural networks) to predict several severe complications (mortality, renal failure with a need for renal replacement therapy, and postoperative bleeding leading to operative revision) in post cardiosurgical care in real time. Adult patients who underwent major open heart surgery from Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 31, 2016, in a German tertiary care centre for cardiovascular diseases formed the main derivation dataset. We measured the accuracy and timeliness of the deep learning model's forecasts and compared predictive quality to that of established standard-of-care clinical reference tools (clinical rule for postoperative bleeding, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II for mortality, and the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes staging criteria for acute renal failure) using positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), and the F1 measure (which computes a harmonic mean of sensitivity and PPV). Results were externally retrospectively validated with 5898 cases from the published MIMIC-III dataset.
Findings
Of 47 559 intensive care admissions (corresponding to 42 007 patients), we included 11 492 (corresponding to 9269 patients). The deep learning models yielded accurate predictions with the following PPV and sensitivity scores: PPV 0·90 and sensitivity 0·85 for mortality, 0·87 and 0·94 for renal failure, and 0·84 and 0·74 for bleeding. The predictions significantly outperformed the standard clinical reference tools, improving the absolute complication prediction AUC by 0·29 (95% CI 0·23–0·35) for bleeding, by 0·24 (0·19–0·29) for mortality, and by 0·24 (0·13–0·35) for renal failure (p<0·0001 for all three analyses). The deep learning methods showed accurate predictions immediately after patient admission to the intensive care unit. We also observed an increase in performance in our validation cohort when the machine learning approach was tested against clinical reference tools, with absolute improvements in AUC of 0·09 (95% CI 0·03–0·15; p=0·0026) for bleeding, of 0·18 (0·07–0·29; p=0·0013) for mortality, and of 0·25 (0·18–0·32; p<0·0001) for renal failure.
Interpretation
The observed improvements in prediction for all three investigated clinical outcomes have the potential to improve critical care. These findings are noteworthy in that they use routinely collected clinical data exclusively, without the need for any manual processing. The deep machine learning method showed AUC scores that significantly surpass those of clinical reference tools, especially soon after admission. Taken together, these properties are encouraging for prospective deployment in critical care settings to direct the staff's attention towards patients who are most at risk.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) treatment for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has improved the survival of patients. However, a substantial percentage of patients do not respond to this treatment. We examined the use of DNA methylation profiles to determine the efficacy of anti-PD-1 treatment in patients recruited with current stage IV NSCLC.
Methods
In this multicentre study, we recruited adult patients from 15 hospitals in France, Spain, and Italy who had histologically proven stage IV NSCLC and had been exposed to PD-1 blockade during the course of the disease. The study structure comprised a discovery cohort to assess the correlation between epigenetic features and clinical benefit with PD-1 blockade and two validation cohorts to assess the validity of our assumptions. We first established an epigenomic profile based on a microarray DNA methylation signature (EPIMMUNE) in a discovery set of tumour samples from patients treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab. The EPIMMUNE signature was validated in an independent set of patients. A derived DNA methylation marker was validated by a single-methylation assay in a validation cohort of patients. The main study outcomes were progression-free survival and overall survival. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate progression-free and overall survival, and calculated the differences between the groups with the log-rank test. We constructed a multivariate Cox model to identify the variables independently associated with progression-free and overall survival.
Findings
Between June 23, 2014, and May 18, 2017, we obtained samples from 142 patients: 34 in the discovery cohort, 47 in the EPIMMUNE validation cohort, and 61 in the derived methylation marker cohort (the T-cell differentiation factor forkhead box P1 [FOXP1]). The EPIMMUNE signature in patients with stage IV NSCLC treated with anti-PD-1 agents was associated with improved progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0·010, 95% CI 3·29 × 10−4–0·0282; p=0·0067) and overall survival (0·080, 0·017–0·373; p=0·0012). The EPIMMUNE-positive signature was not associated with PD-L1 expression, the presence of CD8+ cells, or mutational load. EPIMMUNE-negative tumours were enriched in tumour-associated macrophages and neutrophils, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and senescent endothelial cells. The EPIMMUNE-positive signature was associated with improved progression-free survival in the EPIMMUNE validation cohort (0·330, 0·149–0·727; p=0·0064). The unmethylated status of FOXP1 was associated with improved progression-free survival (0·415, 0·209–0·802; p=0·0063) and overall survival (0·409, 0·220–0·780; p=0·0094) in the FOXP1 validation cohort. The EPIMMUNE signature and unmethylated FOXP1 were not associated with clinical benefit in lung tumours that did not receive immunotherapy.
Interpretation
Our study shows that the epigenetic milieu of NSCLC tumours indicates which patients are most likely to benefit from nivolumab or pembrolizumab treatments. The methylation status of FOXP1 could be associated with validated predictive biomarkers such as PD-L1 staining and mutational load to better select patients who will experience clinical benefit with PD-1 blockade, and its predictive value should be evaluated in prospective studies.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Human airway organoids are three-dimensional cultures derived from stem cells, which self-organise in ex-vivo conditions to form so-called mini-airways. The cellular morphology of these cultures is physiologically similar to the human airway, with cilia, goblet cells, and club cells facing the inner lumen and basal cells situated at the outer layer. The aim of this study was to compare replication competence, tissue tropism, and host responses elicited by human and avian strains of influenza A virus in ex-vivo human bronchus and human airway organoids.
Methods
Between Sept 29, 2016, and Jan 4, 2017, we obtained ex-vivo cultures of the human bronchus and cultured human airway organoids from lung stem cells obtained from human lung tissues removed as part of the routine clinical care of patients undergoing surgical resection at the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong. We compared viral replication competence, tissue tropism, and cytokine and chemokine induction of avian influenza A viruses isolated from humans (Sh2/H7N9, H5N1/483, H5N6/39715), and human H1N1pdm/415742 in airway organoids and ex-vivo bronchus explant cultures.
Findings
Virus tropism and replication kinetics of human and avian influenza A viruses in human airway organoids mimicked those found in ex-vivo cultures of human bronchus explants. In both airway organoids and bronchus explants, influenza A H1N1 subtype (H1N1) and avian influenza A H7N9 viruses replicated to significantly higher titres than did the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1, whereas HPAI H5N6 replication was moderate. H1N1, H7N9, and H5N6 viruses infected ciliated cells and goblet cells, but not basal cells in both airway organoids and bronchus explants. The expression of cytokines, interleukin 6, and interferon β, and the chemokine regulated-on-activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted, was significantly higher in human airway organoids infected with HPAI H5N1 virus than H1N1pdm/415742, Sh2/H7N9, and H5N6/39715 viruses, and the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 was significantly higher in human organoids infected with HPAI H5N1 virus than H1N1pdm/415742 and Sh2/H7N9 viruses.
Interpretation
Human airway organoid cultures provided results that were comparable to those observed in human ex-vivo bronchus cultures, and thus provide an alternative physiologically relevant experimental model for investigating virus tropism and replication competence that could be used to assess the pandemic threat of animal influenza viruses.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Epigenetic mechanisms could alter the airway epithelial barrier and ultimately lead to atopic diseases such as asthma. We aimed to identify DNA methylation profiles that are associated with—and could accurately classify—atopy and atopic asthma in school-aged children.
Methods
We did a genome-wide study of DNA methylation in nasal epithelium and atopy or atopic asthma in 483 Puerto Rican children aged 9–20 years, recruited using multistage probability sampling. Atopy was defined as at least one positive IgE (≥0·35 IU/mL) to common aeroallergens, and asthma was defined as a physician's diagnosis plus wheeze in the previous year. Significant (false discovery rate p<0·01) methylation signals were correlated with gene expression, and top CpGs were validated by pyrosequencing. We then replicated our top methylation findings in a cohort of 72 predominantly African American children, and in 432 children from a European birth cohort. Next, we tested classification models based on nasal methylation for atopy or atopic asthma in all cohorts.
Findings
DNA methylation profiles were markedly different between children with (n=312) and without (n=171) atopy in the Puerto Rico discovery cohort, recruited from Feb 12, 2014, until May 8, 2017. After adjustment for covariates and multiple testing, we found 8664 differentially methylated CpGs by atopy, with false discovery rate-adjusted p values ranging from 9·58 × 10−17 to 2·18 × 10−22 for the top 30 CpGs. These CpGs were in or near genes relevant to epithelial barrier function, including CDHR3 and CDH26, and in other genes related to airway epithelial integrity and immune regulation, such as FBXL7, NTRK1, and SLC9A3. Moreover, 28 of the top 30 CpGs replicated in the same direction in both independent cohorts. Classification models of atopy based on nasal methylation performed well in the Puerto Rico cohort (area under the curve [AUC] 0·93–0·94 and accuracy 85–88%) and in both replication cohorts (AUC 0·74–0·92, accuracy 68–82%). The models also performed well for atopic asthma in the Puerto Rico cohort (AUC 0·95–1·00, accuracy 88%) and the replication cohorts (AUC 0·82–0·88, accuracy 86%).
Interpretation
We identified specific methylation profiles in airway epithelium that are associated with atopy and atopic asthma in children, and a nasal methylation panel that could classify children by atopy or atopic asthma. Our findings support the feasibility of using the nasal methylome for future clinical applications, such as predicting the development of asthma among wheezing infants.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Delamanid is one of two recently approved drugs for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of delamanid in the first 6 months of treatment.
Methods
This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial was done at 17 sites in seven countries (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Peru, the Philippines, and South Africa). We enrolled eligible adults (>18 years) with pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis to receive, in combination with an optimised background regimen developed according to WHO and national guidelines, either oral delamanid (100 mg twice daily) for 2 months followed by 200 mg once daily for 4 months or placebo (same regimen). Patients were centrally randomised (2:1) and stratified by risk category for delayed sputum culture conversion. Primary outcomes were the time to sputum culture conversion over 6 months and the difference in the distribution of time to sputum culture conversion over 6 months between the two groups, as assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01424670.
Findings
Between Sept 2, 2011, and Nov 27, 2013, we screened 714 patients, of whom 511 were randomly assigned (341 to delamanid plus optimised background regimen [delamanid group] and 170 to placebo plus optimised background regimen [placebo group]) and formed the safety analysis population. 327 patients were culture-positive for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis at baseline and comprised the efficacy analysis population (226 in the delamanid group and 101 in the placebo group). Median time to sputum culture conversion did not differ between the two groups (p=0·0562; modified Peto-Peto), with 51 days (IQR 29–98) in the delamanid group and 57 days (43–85) in the placebo group; the hazard ratio was 1·17 (95% CI 0·91–1·51, p=0·2157). 501 (98·0%) of 511 patients had at least one treatment-emergent adverse event. 136 (26·6%) of 511 patients had at least one serious treatment-emergent adverse event; the incidence was similar between treatment groups (89 [26·1%] of 341 patients for delamanid and 47 [27·6%] of 170 for placebo). Deaths related to treatment-emergent adverse events were similar between groups (15 [4·4%] of 341 for delamanid and six [3·5%] of 170 for placebo). No deaths were considered to be related to delamanid.
Interpretation
The reduction in median time to sputum culture conversion over 6 months was not significant in the primary analysis. Delamanid was well tolerated with a highly characterised safety profile. Further evaluation of delamanid is needed to determine its role in a rapidly evolving standard of care.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The clinical effects of roflumilast, a selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, are well established, but little is known about the anti-inflammatory mechanisms underlying the drug's efficacy. The aim of the ROflumilast Biopsy European Research Trial (ROBERT) was to assess the anti-inflammatory effects of roflumilast on bronchial mucosal inflammation in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic bronchitis.
Methods
ROBERT was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial done at 18 sites in five countries. Eligible patients were aged 40–80 years, had COPD, and had had a chronic productive cough for 3 months in each of the two previous years. Patients also had to have a post-bronchodilator predicted FEV1 30–80% and a post-bronchodilator FEV1/forced vital capacity ratio of 70% or less. Patients entered a 6-week run-in period before being randomly assigned (1:1) via a computerised central randomisation system to roflumilast 500 μg once daily or placebo for 16 weeks, in addition to bronchodilator therapy (inhaled corticosteroids were not permitted). Randomisation was stratified by concomitant use of long-acting β agonist. Both participants and investigators were masked to group assignment. Roflumilast and placebo were supplied as identical yellow, triangular tablets. Airway inflammation was assessed by quantification of inflammatory cells in bronchial biopsy samples and induced sputum samples. The primary endpoint was the change in the number of CD8 inflammatory cells in bronchial biopsy submucosa from randomisation to week 16 in the intention-to-treat population. Changes in cell counts of additional inflammatory markers, including eosinophils, were assessed as secondary endpoints. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01509677, and is closed to new participants, with follow-up completed.
Findings
Between Jan 4, 2012, and Feb 11, 2016, 158 patients were randomly assigned: 79 to the roflumilast group, and 79 to the placebo group. At week 16, the change in the number of CD8 cells in the bronchial submucosa did not differ significantly between the roflumilast and placebo groups (treatment ratio 1·03 [95% CI 0·82–1·30]; p=0·79). However, compared with placebo, roflumilast was associated with a significant reduction in eosinophils in bronchial biopsy samples at week 16 (treatment ratio 0·53 [95% CI 0·34–0·82]; p=0·0046). Significant reductions in both absolute (p=0·0042) and differential (p=0·0086) eosinophil cell counts in induced sputum were also noted with roflumilast compared with placebo, but peripheral blood eosinophil counts were not significantly affected. We noted no other significant effects of roflumilast on bronchial mucosal inflammatory cells. The most common (ie, occurring in >5% patients) moderate adverse events were worsening of COPD (three [4%] patients in the roflumilast group vs seven [9%] in the placebo group), cough (six [8%] vs four [5%]), diarrhoea (four [5%] vs three [4%]), and nasopharyngitis (three [4%] vs five [6%]). Severe adverse events included worsening of COPD, which occurred in four (5%) patients in the roflumilast group and two (3%) in the placebo group. No deaths occurred during the study. Serious adverse events occurred in eight (10%) patients in the roflumilast group and five (6%) in the placebo group.
Interpretation
16 weeks of treatment with roflumilast did not affect the number of CD8 cells in bronchial submucosa compared with placebo. However, we noted significant reductions in eosinophil cell counts in bronchial biopsy samples and induced sputum, generating the hypothesis that the effect of roflumilast in COPD could be mediated by an effect on lung eosinophils.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Paediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) is associated with high mortality in children, but until recently no paediatric-specific diagnostic criteria existed. The Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference (PALICC) definition was developed to overcome limitations of the Berlin definition, which was designed and validated for adults. We aimed to determine the incidence and outcomes of children who meet the PALICC definition of PARDS.
Methods
In this international, prospective, cross-sectional, observational study, 145 paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) from 27 countries were recruited, and over a continuous 5 day period across 10 weeks all patients were screened for enrolment. Patients were included if they had a new diagnosis of PARDS that met PALICC criteria during the study week. Exclusion criteria included meeting PARDS criteria more than 24 h before screening, cyanotic heart disease, active perinatal lung disease, and preparation or recovery from a cardiac intervention. Data were collected on the PICU characteristics, patient demographics, and elements of PARDS (ie, PARDS risk factors, hypoxaemia severity metrics, type of ventilation), comorbidities, chest imaging, arterial blood gas measurements, and pulse oximetry. The primary outcome was PICU mortality. Secondary outcomes included 90 day mortality, duration of invasive mechanical and non-invasive ventilation, and cause of death.
Findings
Between May 9, 2016, and June 16, 2017, during the 10 study weeks, 23 280 patients were admitted to participating PICUs, of whom 744 (3·2%) were identified as having PARDS. 95% (708 of 744) of patients had complete data for analysis, with 17% (121 of 708; 95% CI 14–20) mortality, whereas only 32% (230 of 708) of patients met Berlin criteria with 27% (61 of 230) mortality. Based on hypoxaemia severity at PARDS diagnosis, mortality was similar among those who were non-invasively ventilated and with mild or moderate PARDS (10–15%), but higher for those with severe PARDS (33% [54 of 165; 95% CI 26–41]). 50% (80 of 160) of non-invasively ventilated patients with PARDS were subsequently intubated, with 25% (20 of 80; 95% CI 16–36) mortality. By use of PALICC PARDS definition, severity of PARDS at 6 h after initial diagnosis (area under the curve [AUC] 0·69, 95% CI 0·62–0·76) discriminates PICU mortality better than severity at PARDS diagnosis (AUC 0·64, 0·58–0·71), and outperforms Berlin severity groups at 6 h (0·64, 0·58–0·70; p=0·01).
Interpretation
The PALICC definition identified more children as having PARDS than the Berlin definition, and PALICC PARDS severity groupings improved the stratification of mortality risk, particularly when applied 6 h after PARDS diagnosis. The PALICC PARDS framework should be considered for use in future epidemiological and therapeutic research among children with PARDS.

Background
Long-acting β2 agonists (LABAs) and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) are the recommended initial maintenance treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), with almost all LABAs dispensed in fixed combination with inhaled corticosteroids (LABA-ICS). We compared the effectiveness and safety of LABA-ICS versus LAMA treatment initiation as a function of blood eosinophilia, a potential biomarker of ICS effectiveness, in a real-world setting.
Methods
In this population-based cohort study, we identified a cohort of patients with COPD initiating treatment with a LAMA or LABA-ICS during 2002–15, age 55 years or older, from the UK's Clinical Practice Research Datalink. We excluded patients who initiated treatment with both bronchodilators on the same date. All patients required at least 1 year of medical history and a measure of blood eosinophil concentration before cohort entry, defined by the date of the first cohort-defining bronchodilator prescription. Patients initiating a LAMA were matched on high-dimensional propensity scores with patients initiating a LABA-ICS. They were followed up for 1 year for the occurrence of a moderate or severe COPD exacerbation and for severe pneumonia. Sensitivity analyses included, among others, repeating the analysis among patients with two blood eosinophil concentration measures and stratification by concurrent asthma and previous exacerbations.
Findings
The base cohort included 539 643 patients with a prescription for LABAs or LAMAs from Jan 1, 2002, to Dec 31, 2015, of whom 18 500 were initiated on LABA-ICS and 13 870 on LAMAs. Propensity score analysis resulted in 12 366 initiators of LAMAs (mainly tiotropium) matched to 12 366 initiators of LABA-ICS. The hazard ratio (HR) of COPD exacerbation associated with LABA-ICS initiation, relative to LAMA initiation, was 0·95 (95% CI 0·90–1·01). In patients with blood eosinophil concentrations of less than 2% of white blood cell count, the HR was 1·03 (95% CI 0·93–1·13) and for those with eosinophil concentrations of 2–4%, the HR was 1·00 (0·91–1·10). For patients with eosinophil concentrations of more than 4%, the HR was 0·79 (0·70–0·88). The incidence of pneumonia increased with LABA-ICS initiation (HR 1·37 [95% CI 1·17–1·60]) and was similar across all eosinophil concentrations. Sensitivity analyses were consistent with these findings, but the incidence of exacerbation with LABA-ICS among the 2766 (11%) of all 24 732 patients with two or more COPD exacerbations during the baseline year was marginally lower (HR 0·87 [95% CI 0·79–0·97]).
Interpretation
In this real-world, clinical practice, observational study, initial COPD treatment with LABA-ICS inhalers was only more effective than with LAMAs in patients with high blood eosinophil concentrations (>4%) or counts (>300 cells per μL) and possibly in frequent exacerbators. Because of the increased risk of pneumonia associated with the ICS component, initiation with a LAMA should be preferred in patients with blood eosinophil concentrations of less than 4%.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Addition of bedaquiline to treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis was associated with an increased risk of death in a phase 2b clinical trial, resulting in caution from WHO. Following a compassionate access programme and local regulatory approval, the South African National Tuberculosis Programme began widespread use of bedaquiline in March, 2015, especially among patients with extensively drug resistant tuberculosis for whom no other effective treatment options were available. We aimed to compare mortality in patients on standard regimens with that of patients on regimens including bedaquiline.
Methods
In this retrospective cohort study, we analysed patient data from the South African rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis case register (EDRweb), and identified additional mortality using the national vital statistics register. We excluded patients who started treatment before July 1, 2014, or after March 31, 2016; patients younger than 15 years or older than 75 years; patients without documented rifampicin resistance, and patients with pre-extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (multidrug-resistant tuberculosis with further resistance to a second-line injectable or fluoroquinolone). We compared all-cause mortality between patients who received bedaquiline in treatment regimens and those who did not. Patients who did not receive bedaquiline had kanamycin or capreomycin and moxifloxacin as core medicines in their regimen. We estimated hazard ratios for mortality separately for multidrug-resistant or rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis and adjusted using propensity score quintile strata for the potential confounders of sex, age, HIV and antiretroviral therapy status, history of prior tuberculosis, valid identification number, and year and province of treatment.
Findings
24 014 tuberculosis cases were registered in the EDRweb between July 1, 2014, and March 31, 2016. Of these, 19 617 patients initiated treatment and met our analysis eligibility criteria. A bedaquiline-containing regimen was given to 743 (4·0%) of 18 542 patients with multidrug-resistant or rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis and 273 (25·4%) of 1075 patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. Among 1016 patients who received bedaquiline, 128 deaths (12·6%) were reported, and there were 4612 deaths (24·8%) among 18 601 patients on the standard regimens. Bedaquiline was associated with a reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality for patients with multidrug-resistant or rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (hazard ratio [HR] 0·35, 95% CI 0·28–0·46) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (0·26, 0·18–0·38) compared with standard regimens.
Interpretation
Our retrospective cohort analysis of routinely reported data in the context of high HIV and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis prevalence showed that bedaquiline-based treatment regimens were associated with a large reduction in mortality in patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis, compared with the standard regimen.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Rare genetic variants cause pulmonary arterial hypertension, but the contribution of common genetic variation to disease risk and natural history is poorly characterised. We tested for genome-wide association for pulmonary arterial hypertension in large international cohorts and assessed the contribution of associated regions to outcomes.
Methods
We did two separate genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and a meta-analysis of pulmonary arterial hypertension. These GWAS used data from four international case-control studies across 11 744 individuals with European ancestry (including 2085 patients). One GWAS used genotypes from 5895 whole-genome sequences and the other GWAS used genotyping array data from an additional 5849 individuals. Cross-validation of loci reaching genome-wide significance was sought by meta-analysis. Conditional analysis corrected for the most significant variants at each locus was used to resolve signals for multiple associations. We functionally annotated associated variants and tested associations with duration of survival. All-cause mortality was the primary endpoint in survival analyses.
Findings
A locus near SOX17 (rs10103692, odds ratio 1·80 [95% CI 1·55–2·08], p=5·13 × 10–15) and a second locus in HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 (collectively referred to as HLA-DPA1/DPB1 here; rs2856830, 1·56 [1·42–1·71], p=7·65 × 10–20) within the class II MHC region were associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension. The SOX17 locus had two independent signals associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (rs13266183, 1·36 [1·25–1·48], p=1·69 × 10–12; and rs10103692). Functional and epigenomic data indicate that the risk variants near SOX17 alter gene regulation via an enhancer active in endothelial cells. Pulmonary arterial hypertension risk variants determined haplotype-specific enhancer activity, and CRISPR-mediated inhibition of the enhancer reduced SOX17 expression. The HLA-DPA1/DPB1 rs2856830 genotype was strongly associated with survival. Median survival from diagnosis in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension with the C/C homozygous genotype was double (13·50 years [95% CI 12·07 to >13·50]) that of those with the T/T genotype (6·97 years [6·02–8·05]), despite similar baseline disease severity.
Interpretation
This is the first study to report that common genetic variation at loci in an enhancer near SOX17 and in HLA-DPA1/DPB1 is associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Impairment of SOX17 function might be more common in pulmonary arterial hypertension than suggested by rare mutations in SOX17. Further studies are needed to confirm the association between HLA typing or rs2856830 genotyping and survival, and to determine whether HLA typing or rs2856830 genotyping improves risk stratification in clinical practice or trials.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Based on international diagnostic guidelines, high-resolution CT plays a central part in the diagnosis of fibrotic lung disease. In the correct clinical context, when high-resolution CT appearances are those of usual interstitial pneumonia, a diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis can be made without surgical lung biopsy. We investigated the use of a deep learning algorithm for provision of automated classification of fibrotic lung disease on high-resolution CT according to criteria specified in two international diagnostic guideline statements: the 2011 American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS)/Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS)/Latin American Thoracic Association (ALAT) guidelines for diagnosis and management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and the Fleischner Society diagnostic criteria for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
Methods
In this case-cohort study, for algorithm development and testing, a database of 1157 anonymised high-resolution CT scans showing evidence of diffuse fibrotic lung disease was generated from two institutions. We separated the scans into three non-overlapping cohorts (training set, n=929; validation set, n=89; and test set A, n=139) and classified them using 2011 ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis diagnostic guidelines. For each scan, the lungs were segmented and resampled to create a maximum of 500 unique four slice combinations, which we converted into image montages. The final training dataset consisted of 420 096 unique montages for algorithm training. We evaluated algorithm performance, reported as accuracy, prognostic accuracy, and weighted κ coefficient (κw) of interobserver agreement, on test set A and a cohort of 150 high-resolution CT scans (test set B) with fibrotic lung disease compared with the majority vote of 91 specialist thoracic radiologists drawn from multiple international thoracic imaging societies. We then reclassified high-resolution CT scans according to Fleischner Society diagnostic criteria for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. We retrained the algorithm using these criteria and evaluated its performance on 75 fibrotic lung disease specific high-resolution CT scans compared with four specialist thoracic radiologists using weighted κ coefficient of interobserver agreement.
Findings
The accuracy of the algorithm on test set A was 76·4%, with 92·7% of diagnoses within one category. The algorithm took 2·31 s to evaluate 150 four slice montages (each montage representing a single case from test set B). The median accuracy of the thoracic radiologists on test set B was 70·7% (IQR 65·3–74·7), and the accuracy of the algorithm was 73·3% (93·3% were within one category), outperforming 60 (66%) of 91 thoracic radiologists. Median interobserver agreement between each of the thoracic radiologists and the radiologist's majority opinion was good (κw=0·67 [IQR 0·58–0·72]). Interobserver agreement between the algorithm and the radiologist's majority opinion was good (κw=0·69), outperforming 56 (62%) of 91 thoracic radiologists. The algorithm provided equally prognostic discrimination between usual interstitial pneumonia and non-usual interstitial pneumonia diagnoses (hazard ratio 2·88, 95% CI 1·79–4·61, p<0·0001) compared with the majority opinion of the thoracic radiologists (2·74, 1·67–4·48, p<0·0001). For Fleischner Society high-resolution CT criteria for usual interstitial pneumonia, median interobserver agreement between the radiologists was moderate (κw=0·56 [IQR 0·55–0·58]), but was good between the algorithm and the radiologists (κw=0·64 [0·55–0·72]).
Interpretation
High-resolution CT evaluation by a deep learning algorithm might provide low-cost, reproducible, near-instantaneous classification of fibrotic lung disease with human-level accuracy. These methods could be of benefit to centres at which thoracic imaging expertise is scarce, as well as for stratification of patients in clinical trials.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Treprostinil, a prostacyclin analogue, is effective for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. However, information is scarce regarding treprostinil for treatment of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous treprostinil in this setting.
Methods
In this 24-week, randomised, double-blind controlled trial, we enrolled patients with CTEPH, classified as non-operable, or with persistent or recurrent pulmonary hypertension after pulmonary endarterectomy, in six European expert centres in Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, and Poland. Patients in WHO functional class III or IV with a 6-min walk distance of 150–400 m were randomly assigned at a 1:1 allocation ratio to continuous high-dose subcutaneous treprostinil (target dose around 30 ng/kg per min at week 12) or low-dose subcutaneous treprostinil (target dose around 3 ng/kg per min at week 12). The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in 6-min walk distance at week 24. All patients who received at least one dose of the study drug were included in the intention-to-treat efficacy and safety analyses based on assessment of adverse events. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrialsRegister.eu EudraCT number 2008-006441-10 and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01416636.
Findings
From March 9, 2009, to June 9, 2016, 105 patients were enrolled with 53 (50%) patients randomly assigned to high-dose and 52 (50%) patients to low-dose subcutaneous treprostinil. At week 24, marginal mean 6-min walk distance improved by 44·98 m (95% CI 27·52 to 62·45) in the high-dose group, and by 4·29 m (95% CI −13·34 to 21·92) in the low-dose group (treatment effect 40·69 m, 95% CI 15·86 to 65·53, p=0·0016). 12 serious adverse events were reported in ten (19%) of 52 patients from the low-dose group and 16 serious adverse events were reported in nine (17%) of 53 patients from the high-dose group. The most common treatment-related adverse events in both groups were infusion site pain and other infusion site reactions.
Interpretation
Treatment with subcutaneous treprostinil was safe, and improved exercise capacity in patients with severe CTEPH. Subcutaneous treprostinil provides a parenteral treatment option for patients of WHO functional class III or IV and those who do not tolerate other therapies or need combination treatment.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Few studies have assessed the safety and efficacy of potential asthma medications in children younger than 5 years. We descriptively assessed the safety and efficacy of tiotropium, a long-acting anticholinergic drug, in children aged 1–5 years with persistent asthmatic symptoms.
Methods
This exploratory 12-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 2/3, regulatory multicentre trial was done at 32 hospitals, clinics, and clinical research units in 11 countries in Asia, Europe, and North America. Children aged 1–5 years with at least a 6-month history of persistent asthmatic symptoms and a need for inhaled corticosteroids were eligible. Patients were randomly allocated using an interactive voice or web-based response system to receive once-daily tiotropium 2·5 μg, tiotropium 5 μg, or placebo as an add-on to inhaled corticosteroids with or without additional controller medication. Patients and investigators were masked to study group assignment. Tiotropium was given via the Respimat inhaler once daily as two puffs of 1·25 μg in the 2·5 μg group, two puffs of 2·5 μg in the 5 μg group, or two puffs of placebo. The primary outcomes were safety, which was assessed by comparing adverse events between the tiotropium and placebo groups, and efficacy, which was measured as the change in weekly mean combined daytime asthma symptom score from baseline to week 12. Statistical analyses of treatment effects were exploratory; although endpoints were defined, they were used for descriptive analyses only. The safety and primary analyses were done in all patients who received at least one dose of their assigned treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01634113), and is completed.
Findings
Between July 26, 2012, and Dec 4, 2014, 102 children were randomly assigned to the three treatment groups (36 to receive tiotropium 2·5 μg, 32 to receive tiotropium 5 μg, and 34 to receive placebo). 101 children completed the study and were included in the analyses. The changes in adjusted weekly mean combined daytime asthma symptom scores between baseline and week 12 were not significantly different between any of the groups. The adjusted mean difference between the tiotropium 2·5 μg group and placebo group was −0·080 (95% CI −0·312 to 0·152) and the difference between tiotropium 5 μg and placebo group was −0·048 (−0·292 to 0·195). Adverse events were less frequent with tiotropium treatment than with placebo (20 [56%] of 36 children with tiotropium 2·5 μg, 18 [58%] of 31 with tiotropium 5 μg, and 25 [74%] of 34 with placebo), although no formal statistical comparison between groups was performed. A greater proportion of children reported asthma exacerbations as adverse events in the placebo group (ten [29%] of 34) than in the tiotropium groups (five [14%] of 36 in the 2·5 μg group and two [6%] of 31 in the 5 μg group). Serious adverse events were reported in three patients (all of whom received placebo); no adverse events led to discontinuation of treatment or death.
Interpretation
To our knowledge, our small study is the first to assess the safety and efficacy of tiotropium in children aged 1–5 years with persistent asthmatic symptoms. Tolerability of tiotropium was similar to that of placebo, which is consistent with previous findings in older populations. Although mean daytime asthma symptom scores were not significantly different between groups, tiotropium showed the potential to reduce asthma exacerbation risk compared with placebo. The findings of the study are limited by the small sample size and descriptive statistical analyses. Additional well powered trials are needed to further assess the safety and efficacy of tiotropium in young children.

Background
Children of preschool age often have episodes of virus-associated wheeze, and research assessing efficacy of corticosteroids for paediatric wheeze exacerbations is inconclusive.
Methods
This non-inferiority, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was to compare the efficacy of placebo versus oral prednisolone in children aged 24–72 months presenting with virus-associated wheeze at the paediatric emergency department of Princess Margaret Hospital in Perth, WA, Australia. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated random number program to receive placebo or prednisolone (1 mg/kg per day) for 3 days. The primary outcome was total length of stay in hospital until ready for discharge. Following an analysis to test the hypothesis that placebo is non-inferior to prednisolone, a post-hoc superiority analysis was done to test the hypothesis that prednisolone was superior to placebo. A non-inferiority margin of 10% was used to establish non-inferiority. Efficacy analyses were on a modified intention-to-treat basis, whereby patients were excluded from the final efficacy analysis if consent was withdrawn, two doses of study drug were vomited, or paperwork was lost. All participants were included in safety analyses. This study is registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12612000394842.
Findings
Between June 11, 2012, and June 10, 2015, we screened 3727 patients for eligibility. 624 eligible patients were randomly assigned to treatment, and 605 patients were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (300 patients from the placebo group, 305 patients from the prednisolone group). The median length of stay until ready for discharge was longer in the placebo group (540 min [IQR 124–971]) than in the prednisolone group (370 min [121–709]); placebo was inferior to prednisolone. In the post-hoc superiority analysis of 605 patients, the unadjusted ratio of geometric mean for length of stay was 0·79 (95% CI 0·64–0·97; p=0·0227) for the prednisolone group relative to the placebo group. No serious adverse events were reported during the study or follow-up period. One child in the placebo group had a non-specific maculopapular rash, which resolved spontaneously. Two children (one from each group) were reported to be hyperactive during follow-up assessments.
Interpretation
Oral prednisolone had a clear benefit over placebo at reducing the length of stay in children presenting to a paediatric emergency department with virus-associated wheeze and was well tolerated.

abstract = "Summary
The incidence of sepsis is highest in neonates and children, yet the global burden of sepsis in these age groups has not been assessed. We reviewed available evidence from observational epidemiological studies to estimate the global burden and mortality of sepsis in neonates and children. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting population-based sepsis incidence in neonates and children, published between 1979 and 2016. Our search yielded 1270 studies, 23 of which met the inclusion criteria; 16 were from high-income countries and seven from middle-income countries. 15 studies from 12 countries reported complete data and were included in the meta-analysis. We found an aggregate estimate of 48 (95% CI 27–86) sepsis cases and 22 (14–33) severe sepsis cases in children per 100 000 person-years. Mortality ranged from 1% to 5% for sepsis and 9% to 20% for severe sepsis. The population-level estimate for neonatal sepsis was 2202 (95% CI 1099–4360) per 100 000 livebirths, with mortality between 11% and 19%. Extrapolating these figures on a global scale, we estimate an incidence of 3·0 million cases of sepsis in neonates and 1·2 million cases in children. Although these results confirm that sepsis is a common and frequently fatal condition affecting neonates and children globally, few population-based data are available from low-income settings and the lack of standardisation of diagnostic criteria and definition of sepsis in the reviewed studies are obstacles to the accurate estimation of global burden. Robust epidemiological monitoring to define global sepsis incidence and mortality in children is urgently needed."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Despite effective pharmacotherapy, asthma continues to impair quality of life for most patients. Non-pharmacological approaches, including breathing retraining, are therefore of great interest to patients. However, clinicians rarely advocate breathing retraining and access to this intervention is restricted for most patients due to the limited availability of suitable physiotherapists and poor integration of breathing retraining into standard care. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of a digital self-guided breathing retraining intervention.
Methods
In this randomised controlled trial, we recruited patients from 34 general practices in the UK. Eligibility criteria for patients with asthma were broad, comprising a physician diagnosis of asthma, age of 16–70 years, receipt of at least one anti-asthma medication in the previous year, and impaired asthma-related quality of life (Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire [AQLQ] score of <5·5). We developed a self-guided intervention, which was delivered as a DVD plus a printed booklet (DVDB). Participants were randomly assigned to receive either the DVDB intervention, three face-to-face breathing retraining sessions, or standard care, in a 2:1:2 ratio, for 12 months. Randomisation was achieved using the Southampton Clinical Trials Unit telephone randomisation service by use of random number generators. The primary outcome was the AQLQ score in the intention-to-treat population at 12 months. The trial was powered to show equivalence between the two active intervention groups, and superiority of both intervention groups over usual care. Secondary outcomes included patient-reported and physiological measures of asthma control, patient acceptability, and health-care costs. This trial was registered with International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number registry, number ISRCTN88318003.
Findings
Between Nov 5, 2012 and Jan 28, 2014, invitations to participate in the study were sent to 15 203 patients with general practitioner-diagnosed asthma, of whom 655 were recruited into the study. AQLQ scores at 12 months were significantly higher in the DVDB group (mean 5·40, SD 1·14) than in the usual care group (5·12, SD 1·17; adjusted mean difference 0·28, 95% CI 0·11 to 0·44), and in the face-to-face group (5·33, SD 1·06) than in the usual care group (adjusted mean difference 0·24, 95% CI 0·04 to 0·44); AQLQ scores were similar between the DVDB group and the face-to-face group (0·04, 95% CI −0·16 to 0·24). There were no significant differences between the randomisation groups in FEV1 or fraction of exhaled nitric oxide. 744 adverse events occurred in 272 patients: 101 (39%) of 261 patients in the DVDB group, 55 (42%) of 132 patients in the face-to-face group, and 132 (50%) of 262 in the usual care group, with patients reporting one or more event. 11 (4%) patients in the DVDB group, four (3%) patients in the face-to-face group, and 20 (8%) patients in the usual care group had a serious adverse event.
Interpretation
Breathing retraining programmes improve quality of life in patients with incompletely controlled asthma despite having little effect on lung function or airway inflammation. Such programmes can be delivered conveniently and cost-effectively as a self-guided digital audiovisual programme, so might also reduce health-care costs.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The concept that small conducting airways less than 2 mm in diameter become the major site of airflow obstruction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is well established in the scientific literature, and the last generation of small conducting airways, terminal bronchioles, are known to be destroyed in patients with very severe COPD. We aimed to determine whether destruction of the terminal and transitional bronchioles (the first generation of respiratory airways) occurs before, or in parallel with, emphysematous tissue destruction.
Methods
In this cross-sectional analysis, we applied a novel multiresolution CT imaging protocol to tissue samples obtained using a systematic uniform sampling method to obtain representative unbiased samples of the whole lung or lobe of smokers with normal lung function (controls) and patients with mild COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD] stage 1), moderate COPD (GOLD 2), or very severe COPD (GOLD 4). Patients with GOLD 1 or GOLD 2 COPD and smokers with normal lung function had undergone lobectomy and pneumonectomy, and patients with GOLD 4 COPD had undergone lung transplantation. Lung tissue samples were used for stereological assessment of the number and morphology of terminal and transitional bronchioles, airspace size (mean linear intercept), and alveolar surface area.
Findings
Of the 34 patients included in this study, ten were controls (smokers with normal lung function), ten patients had GOLD 1 COPD, eight had GOLD 2 COPD, and six had GOLD 4 COPD with centrilobular emphysema. The 34 lung specimens provided 262 lung samples. Compared with control smokers, the number of terminal bronchioles decreased by 40% in patients with GOLD 1 COPD (p=0·014) and 43% in patients with GOLD 2 COPD (p=0·036), the number of transitional bronchioles decreased by 56% in patients with GOLD 1 COPD (p=0·0001) and 59% in patients with GOLD 2 COPD (p=0·0001), and alveolar surface area decreased by 33% in patients with GOLD 1 COPD (p=0·019) and 45% in patients with GOLD 2 COPD (p=0·0021). These pathological changes were found to correlate with lung function decline. We also showed significant loss of terminal and transitional bronchioles in lung samples from patients with GOLD 1 or GOLD 2 COPD that had a normal alveolar surface area. Remaining small airways were found to have thickened walls and narrowed lumens, which become more obstructed with increasing COPD GOLD stage.
Interpretation
These data show that small airways disease is a pathological feature in mild and moderate COPD. Importantly, this study emphasises that early intervention for disease modification might be required by patients with mild or moderate COPD.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The role of interleukin 13 in airway inflammation and remodelling in asthma is unclear. Tralokinumab is a human monoclonal antibody that neutralises interleukin 13. We aimed to evaluate whether tralokinumab would have an effect on airway eosinophilic infiltration, blood and sputum eosinophil concentrations, eosinophil activation, and airway remodelling.
Methods
We did a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial at 15 centres across the UK, Denmark, and Canada. We enrolled participants of either sex aged 18–75 years with inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe asthma for 12 months or more, requiring treatment with inhaled corticosteroids at a stable dose. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to receive tralokinumab (300 mg) or placebo by an interactive web-based system or voice response system. Participants and study personnel were masked to treatment allocation. Both tralokinumab and placebo were administered subcutaneously every 2 weeks. The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to week 12 in bronchial biopsy eosinophil count. Secondary outcome measures included change in blood and sputum eosinophil counts. Exploratory outcomes included fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) and blood IgE concentrations. Safety analyses were carried out in all participants who received study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02449473, and with the European Clinical Trials Database, EudraCT 2015-000857-19.
Findings
Between Sept 25, 2015, and June 21, 2017, 224 participants were enrolled and screened. Of these participants, 79 were randomly assigned to receive tralokinumab (n=39) or placebo (n=40). Tralokinumab did not significantly affect bronchial eosinophil count compared with placebo at week 12 (treatment effect ratio 1·43, 95% CI 0·63–3·27; p=0·39). Compared with placebo, tralokinumab did not significantly affect blood eosinophil count (treatment effect ratio 1·21, 95% CI 1·00–1·48; p=0·055) or sputum eosinophil count (0·57, 0·06–6·00; p=0·63), but FENO concentration (0·78, 0·63–0·96; p=0·023) and total blood IgE concentration (0·86, 0·77–0·97; p=0·014) were significantly reduced. 33 (85%) of 39 patients receiving tralokinumab and 32 (80%) of 40 receiving placebo reported at least one adverse event during the treatment period. No deaths in either treatment group were observed. Treatment-related adverse events occurred more frequently in the tralokinumab group than in the placebo group (11 [28%] of 39 vs seven [18%] of 40).
Interpretation
Tralokinumab did not significantly affect eosinophilic inflammation in bronchial submucosa, blood, or sputum compared with placebo, but did reduce FENO and IgE concentrations. These results suggest interleukin 13 is not crucial for eosinophilic airway inflammation control in moderate-to-severe asthma.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Maximal lung function in early adulthood is an important determinant of mortality and COPD. We investigated whether distinct trajectories of lung function are present during childhood and whether these extend to adulthood and infancy.
Methods
To ascertain trajectories of FEV1, we studied two population-based birth cohorts (MAAS and ALSPAC) with repeat spirometry from childhood into early adulthood (1046 participants from 5–16 years and 1390 participants from 8–24 years). We used a third cohort (PIAF) with repeat lung function measures in infancy (V'maxFRC) and childhood (FEV1; 196 participants from 1 month to 18 years of age) to investigate whether these childhood trajectories extend from early life. We identified trajectories using latent profile modelling. We created an allele score to investigate genetic associations of trajectories, and constructed a multivariable model to identify their early-life predictors.
Findings
We identified four childhood FEV1 trajectories: persistently high, normal, below average, and persistently low. The persistently low trajectory (129 [5%] of 2436 participants) was associated with persistent wheezing and asthma throughout follow-up. In genetic analysis, compared with the normal trajectory, the pooled relative risk ratio per allele was 0·96 (95% CI 0·92–1·01; p=0·13) for persistently high, 1·01 (0·99–1·02; p=0·49) for below average, and 1·05 (0·98–1·13; p=0·13) for persistently low. Most children in the low V'maxFRC trajectory in infancy did not progress to the low FEV1 trajectory in childhood. Early-life factors associated with the persistently low trajectory included recurrent wheeze with severe wheezing exacerbations, early allergic sensitisation, and tobacco smoke exposure.
Interpretation
Reduction of childhood smoke exposure and minimisation of the risk of early-life sensitisation and wheezing exacerbations might reduce the risk of diminished lung function in early adulthood.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Chronic non-specific respiratory symptoms are difficult to manage. This trial aimed to evaluate the association between baseline fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and the response to inhaled corticosteroids in patients with non-specific respiratory symptoms.
Methods
In this double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial, we enrolled undiagnosed patients, aged 18–80 years, with cough, wheeze, or dyspnoea and less than 20% bronchodilator reversibility across 26 primary care centres and hospitals in the UK and Singapore. Patients were assessed for 2 weeks before being randomly assigned (1:1) to 4 weeks of treatment with extrafine inhaled corticosteroids (QVAR 80 μg, two puffs twice per day, equivalent to 800 μg per day beclomethasone dipropionate) or placebo. Randomisation was stratified by baseline FeNO measurement: normal (≤25 parts per billion [ppb]), intermediate (>25 tp <40 ppb), and high (≥40 ppb). The primary endpoint was change in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ7) mean score. We used generalised linear modelling to assess FeNO as a predictor of response, estimating an interaction effect between FeNO and treatment on change in ACQ7. We did our primary and secondary analyses in the per-protocol set, which excluded patients with non-completion of the primary endpoint, non-compliance to treatment (ascertained by patient report), and study visits made outside the predefined visit windows. This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02294279.
Findings
Between Feb 4, 2015, and July 12, 2016, we randomly assigned 294 patients to extrafine inhaled corticosteroid treatment (n=148) or placebo (n=146). Following exclusions due to protocol violations, we analysed 214 patients (114 extrafine inhaled corticosteroids and 100 placebo). We observed a significant interaction between baseline FeNO and treatment group for every 10 ppb increase in baseline FeNO, with the change in ACQ7 greater in the extrafine inhaled corticosteroids group than in the placebo group (difference between groups 0·071, 95% CI 0·002 to 0·139; p=0·044). The most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis (18 [12%] patients in the treatment group vs 13 [9%] in the placebo group), infections and infestations (25 [17%] vs 21 [14%]), and respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (13 [9%] vs 17 [12%]).
Interpretation
FeNO measurement is an easy and non-invasive tool to use in clinical practice in patients with non-specific respiratory symptoms to predict response to inhaled corticosteroids. Further research is needed to examine its role in patients with evidence of other airway diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

abstract = "Summary
Electronic nicotine delivery systems, or ENDS, are devices that heat and aerosolise a solution of propylene glycol, glycerine, nicotine, and flavourings. They have only achieved widespread use in the past 5 years or so, and therefore evidence around their potential to effect health is scarce. Importantly, they are often viewed as safer than tobacco cigarettes, meaning that at-risk populations, including pregnant women, might be more inclined to use them. No human studies, however, have assessed the potential for maternal ENDS use to effect the health of a developing baby. Experimental research suggests that nicotine alone is likely to adversely affect the fetus. Further, there is a misconception that ENDS do not produce second-hand aerosols. This misconception might put infants and young children at risk because their parents are more likely to use ENDS around them than they are to use tobacco cigarettes. Emerging evidence also proposes that nicotine and other substances produced by ENDS can deposit onto surfaces, and subsequently be exposed to infants and children; a process known as third-hand exposure. Finally, ENDS are often refillable, and instances of accidental poisonings of children who drink nicotine-containing refills have occurred. Thus, there are a multitude of ways that, with respect to early-life exposures and health, ENDS are a cause for concern."

abstract = "Summary
Background
An inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour (IMFT) is a rare mesenchymal neoplasm characterised by anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements. We assessed the activity and safety of crizotinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, targeting ALK in patients with advanced IMFT either with or without ALK alterations.
Methods
We did a multicentre, biomarker-driven, single-drug, non-randomised, open-label, two-stage phase 2 trial (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 90101 CREATE) at 13 study sites (five university hospitals and eight specialty clinics) in eight European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, and the UK). Eligible participants were patients aged at least 15 years with a local diagnosis of advanced or metastatic IMFT deemed incurable with surgery, radiotherapy, or systemic therapy; measurable disease; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0–2; and adequate haematological, renal, and liver function. Central reference pathology was done for confirmation of the diagnosis, and ALK positivity or negativity was assessed centrally using immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in-situ hybridisation based on archival tumour tissue and defined as ALK immunopositivity or rearrangements in at least 15% of tumour cells. Eligible ALK-positive and ALK-negative patients received oral crizotinib 250 mg twice per day administered on a continuous daily dosing schedule (the duration of each treatment cycle was 21 days) until documented disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient refusal. If at least two of the first 12 eligible and assessable ALK-positive patients achieved a confirmed complete or partial response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, a maximum of 35 patients were to be enrolled. If at least six ALK-positive patients achieved a confirmed response, the trial would be deemed successful. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response (ie, a complete or partial response) as per RECIST 1.1, with response confirmation assessed by the local investigator every other cycle. Activity and safety endpoints were analysed in the per-protocol population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01524926.
Findings
Between Oct 3, 2012, and April 12, 2017, we recruited and treated 20 eligible participants, 19 of whom were assessable for the primary endpoint. Median follow-up was 863 days (IQR 358–1304). Six of 12 ALK-positive patients (50%, 95% CI 21·1–78·9) and one of seven ALK-negative patients (14%, 0·0–57·9) achieved an objective response. The most common treatment-related adverse events in the 20 participants were nausea (11 [55%]), fatigue (9 [45%]), blurred vision (nine [45%]), vomiting (seven [35%]), and diarrhoea (seven [35%]). Eight serious adverse events occurred in five patients: pneumonia, fever of unknown cause, a heart attack with increased creatinine and possible sepsis, an abdominal abscess with acute renal insufficiency, and a QT prolongation.
Interpretation
With 50% of participants with ALK-positive tumours achieving an objective response, crizotinib met the prespecified criteria for success in this trial. The results presented here support the rationale for inhibiting ALK in patients with IMFT. Crizotinib could be considered as the standard of care for patients with locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive IMFT who do not qualify for curative surgery.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Delirium during critical illness results from numerous insults, which might be interconnected and yet individually contribute to long-term cognitive impairment. We sought to describe the prevalence and duration of clinical phenotypes of delirium (ie, phenotypes defined by clinical risk factors) and to understand associations between these clinical phenotypes and severity of subsequent long-term cognitive impairment.
Methods
In this multicentre, prospective cohort study, we included adult (≥18 years) medical or surgical ICU patients with respiratory failure, shock, or both as part of two parallel studies: the Bringing to Light the Risk Factors and Incidence of Neuropsychological Dysfunction in ICU Survivors (BRAIN-ICU) study, and the Delirium and Dementia in Veterans Surviving ICU Care (MIND-ICU) study. We assessed patients at least once a day for delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method-ICU and identified a priori-defined, non-mutually exclusive phenotypes of delirium per the presence of hypoxia, sepsis, sedative exposure, or metabolic (eg, renal or hepatic) dysfunction. We considered delirium in the absence of hypoxia, sepsis, sedation, and metabolic dysfunction to be unclassified. 3 and 12 months after discharge, we assessed cognition with the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). We used multiple linear regression to separately analyse associations between the duration of each phenotype of delirium and RBANS global cognition scores at 3-month and 12-month follow-up, adjusting for potential confounders.
Findings
Between March 14, 2007, and May 27, 2010, 1048 participants were enrolled, eight of whom could not be analysed. Of 1040 participants, 708 survived to 3 months of follow-up and 628 to 12 months. Delirium was common, affecting 740 (71%) of 1040 participants at some point during the study and occurring on 4187 (31%) of all 13 434 participant-days. A single delirium phenotype was present on only 1355 (32%) of all 4187 participant-delirium days, whereas two or more phenotypes were present during 2832 (68%) delirium days. Sedative-associated delirium was most common (present during 2634 [63%] delirium days), and a longer duration of sedative-associated delirium predicted a worse RBANS global cognition score 12 months later, after adjusting for covariates (difference in score comparing 3 days vs 0 days: −4·03, 95% CI −7·80 to −0·26). Similarly, longer durations of hypoxic delirium (−3·76, 95% CI −7·16 to −0·37), septic delirium (−3·67, −7·13 to −0·22), and unclassified delirium (−4·70, −7·16 to −2·25) also predicted worse cognitive function at 12 months, whereas duration of metabolic delirium did not (1·14, −0·12 to 3·01).
Interpretation
Our findings suggest that clinicians should consider sedative-associated, hypoxic, and septic delirium, which often co-occur, as distinct indicators of acute brain injury and seek to identify all potential risk factors that may impact on long-term cognitive impairment, especially those that are iatrogenic and potentially modifiable such as sedation.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Pathogen surveillance is challenging but crucial in children with cystic fibrosis—who are often non-productive of sputum even if actively coughing—because infection and lung disease begin early in life. The role of sputum induction as a diagnostic tool for infection has not previously been systematically addressed in young children with cystic fibrosis. We aimed to assess the pathogen yield from sputum induction compared with that from cough swab and single-lobe, two-lobe, and six-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage.
Methods
This prospective internally controlled interventional trial was done at the Children's Hospital for Wales (Cardiff, UK) in children with cystic fibrosis aged between 6 months and 18 years. Samples from cough swab, sputum induction, and single-lobe, two-lobe, and six-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage were matched for within-patient comparisons. Primary outcomes were comparative pathogen yield between sputum induction and cough swab for stage 1, and between sputum induction, and single-lobe, two-lobe, and six-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage for stage 2. Data were analysed as per protocol. This study is registered with the UK Clinical Research Network (14615) and with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Network Registry (12473810).
Findings
Between Jan 23, 2012, and July 4, 2017, 124 patients were prospectively recruited to the trial and had 200 sputum induction procedures for stage 1. 167 (84%) procedures were successful and the procedure was well tolerated. Of the 167 paired samples, 63 (38%) sputum-induction samples were pathogen positive compared with 24 (14%) cough swabs (p<0·0001; odds ratio [OR] 7·5; 95% CI 3·19–17·98). More pathogens were isolated from sputum induction than cough swab (79 [92%] of 86 vs 27 [31%] of 86; p<0·0001). For stage 2, 35 patients had a total of 41 paired sputum-induction and bronchoalveolar lavage procedures. Of the 41 paired samples, 28 (68%) were positive for at least one of the concurrent samples. 39 pathogens were isolated. Sputum induction identified 27 (69%) of the 39 pathogens, compared with 22 (56%; p=0·092; OR 3·3, 95% CI 0·91–12·11) on single-lobe, 28 (72%; p=1·0; OR 1·1, 95% CI 0·41–3·15) on two-lobe, and 33 (85%; p=0·21; OR 2·2, 95% CI 0·76–6·33) on six-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage.
Interpretation
Sputum induction is superior to cough swab for pathogen detection, is effective at sampling the lower airway, and is a credible surrogate for bronchoalveolar lavage in symptomatic children. A substantial number of bronchoscopies could be avoided if sputum induction is done first and pathogens are appropriately treated. Both sputum induction and six-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage provide independent, sizeable gains in pathogen detection compared with the current gold-standard two-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage. We propose that sputum induction and six-lobe bronchoalveolar lavage combined are used as standard of care for comprehensive lower airway pathogen detection in children with cystic fibrosis.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Emergency medical services (EMS) personnel have already made substantial contributions to improving care for patients with time-dependent illnesses, such as trauma and myocardial infarction. Patients with sepsis could also benefit from timely prehospital care.
Methods
After training EMS personnel in recognising sepsis, we did a randomised controlled open-label trial in ten large regional ambulance services serving 34 secondary and tertiary care hospitals in the Netherlands. We compared the effects of early administration of antibiotics in the ambulance with usual care. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using block-randomisation with blocks of size 4 to the intervention (open-label intravenous ceftriaxone 2000 mg in addition to usual care) or usual care (fluid resuscitation and supplementary oxygen). Randomisation was stratified per region. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 28 days and analysis was by intention to treat. To assess the effect of training, we determined the average time to antibiotics (TTA) in the emergency department and recognition of sepsis by EMS personnel before and after training. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01988428.
Findings
2698 patients were enrolled between June 30, 2014, and June 26, 2016. 2672 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis: 1535 in the intervention group and 1137 in the usual care group. The intervention group received antibiotics a median of 26 min (IQR 19–34) before arriving at the emergency department. In the usual care group, median TTA after arriving at the emergency department was 70 min (IQR 36–128), compared with 93 min (IQR 39–140) before EMS personnel training (p=0·142). At day 28, 120 (8%) patients had died in the intervention group and 93 (8%) had died in the usual care group (relative risk 0·95, 95% CI 0·74–1·24). 102 (7%) patients in the intervention group and 119 (10%) in the usual care group were re-admitted to hospital within 28 days (p=0·0004). Seven mild allergic reactions occurred, none of which could be attributed to ceftriaxone.
Interpretation
In patients with varying severity of sepsis, EMS personnel training improved early recognition and care in the whole acute care chain. However, giving antibiotics in the ambulance did not lead to improved survival, regardless of illness severity.

A checklist is provided for the clinical evaluation of patients with suspected usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). The role of CT is expanded to permit diagnosis of IPF without surgical lung biopsy in select cases when CT shows a probable UIP pattern. Additional investigations, including surgical lung biopsy, should be considered in patients with either clinical or CT findings that are indeterminate for IPF. A multidisciplinary approach is particularly important when deciding to perform additional diagnostic assessments, integrating biopsy results with clinical and CT features, and establishing a working diagnosis of IPF if lung tissue is not available. A working diagnosis of IPF should be reviewed at regular intervals since the diagnosis might change. Criteria are presented to establish confident and working diagnoses of IPF."

Cough is a troublesome and difficult-to-treat symptom that accompanies a diverse range of pulmonary and extrapulmonary conditions. Although considerable advances have been made over recent years in basic cough biology, this has not translated into improved clinical management. A major challenge has been in understanding the heterogeneity underlying the development and persistence of chronic cough in different patients. We present evidence that such heterogeneity begins with the multiple peripheral and central neural pathways capable of eliciting cough and associated respiratory behaviours, and extends to incorporate the diversity of diseases that underlie cough and the clinical phenotypic and pathological endotypic presentations that can vary substantially between individual patients with cough. A better understanding of how these sources of heterogeneity are expressed across individual patients with chronic cough is needed to better predict the efficacy of clinical management strategies and of specifically targeted therapies, which will facilitate the development of more personalised clinical approaches to treat patients with chronic cough."

Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease of unknown cause, occurs worldwide and has a highly variable prevalence. The disease is typically dominant in the lungs, although it can affect virtually any organ and is unpredictable in its clinical course. The severity of pulmonary sarcoidosis ranges from incidentally discovered radiographic abnormalities in asymptomatic patients to a chronic progressive disease that is refractory to treatment. Mortality from sarcoidosis appears to have increased in the past three decades, with respiratory failure being the most common cause of sarcoidosis-related death. Pulmonary fibrosis, extensive disease on high-resolution chest CT, impaired lung function, and pulmonary hypertension are well established predictors of poor clinical outcomes. In patients who need systemic therapy to control their disease, corticosteroids are the most commonly used first-line treatment, with antimetabolites generally representing an alternative for patients who are unresponsive to corticosteroids or who cannot tolerate them. Indeed, corticosteroid therapy is associated with toxic effects that correlate with both the cumulative dose and duration of treatment. The scarcity of truly effective therapies and shortage of reliable predictors of the unpredictable development of disease in individual patients greatly contribute to making sarcoidosis such a difficult disease to manage."

In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1 trial, we enrolled HIV-negative, previously BCG-vaccinated adults (aged 18–50 years), with no evidence of previous or current tuberculosis disease, from among community volunteers in the Worcester region of Western Cape, South Africa. Participants were randomly assigned to receive varying doses of ID93 + GLA-SE or saline placebo at day 0, day 28, and day 112. Enrolment into each cohort was sequential. Cohort 1 participants were Mycobacterium tuberculosis uninfected (as defined by negative QuantiFERON [QFT] status), and received 10 μg ID93 plus 2 μg GLA-SE, or placebo; in cohorts 2–4, QFT-negative or positive participants received escalating doses of vaccine or placebo. Cohort 2 received 2 μg ID93 plus 2 μg GLA-SE; cohort 3 received 10 μg ID93 plus 2 μg GLA-SE; and cohort 4 received 10 μg ID93 plus 5 μg GLA-SE. Dose cohort allocation was sequential; randomisation within a cohort was according to a randomly-generated sequence (3 to 1 in cohort 1, 5 to 1 in cohorts 2–4). The primary endpoint was safety of ID93 + GLA-SE as defined by solicited and unsolicited adverse events up to 28 days after each study injection and serious adverse events for the duration of the study. Specific immune responses were measured by intracellular cytokine staining, flow cytometry, and ELISA. All analyses were done according to intention to treat, with additional per-protocol analyses for immunogenicity outcomes. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01927159.
Findings
Between Aug 30, 2013, and Sept 4, 2014, 227 individuals consented to participate; 213 were screened (three participants were not included as study number was already met and 11 withdrew consent before screening occurred, mostly due to relocation or demands of employment). 66 healthy, HIV-negative adults were randomly allocated to receive the vaccine (n=54) or placebo (n=12). All study participants received day 0 and day 28 study injections; five participants did not receive an injection on day 112. ID93 + GLA-SE was well tolerated; no severe or serious vaccine-related adverse events were recorded. Vaccine dose did not affect frequency or severity of adverse events, but mild injection site adverse events and flu-like symptoms were common in M tuberculosis-infected participants compared with uninfected participants. Vaccination induced durable antigen-specific IgG and Th1 cellular responses, which peaked after two administrations. Vaccine dose did not affect magnitude, kinetics, or profile of antibody and cellular responses. Earlier boosting and greater T-cell differentiation and effector-like profiles were seen in M tuberculosis-infected than in uninfected vaccinees.
Interpretation
Escalating doses of ID93 + GLA-SE induced similar antigen-specific CD4-positive T cell and humoral responses, with an acceptable safety profile in BCG-immunised, M tuberculosis-infected individuals. The T-cell differentiation profiles in M tuberculosis-infected vaccinees suggest priming through natural infection. While cohort sample sizes in this phase 1 trial were small and results should be interpreted in context, these data support efficacy testing of two administrations of the lowest (2 μg) ID93 vaccine dose in tuberculosis endemic populations.

abstract = "Summary
European Respiratory Society guidelines for the management of adult bronchiectasis highlight the paucity of treatment options available for patients with this disorder. No treatments have been licensed by regulatory agencies worldwide, and most therapies used in clinical practice are based on very little evidence. Development of new treatments is needed urgently. We did a systematic review of scientific literature and clinical trial registries to identify agents in early-to-late clinical development for bronchiectasis in adults. In this Review, we discuss the mechanisms and potential roles of emerging therapies, including drugs that target airway and systemic inflammation, mucociliary clearance, and epithelial dysfunction. To ensure these treatments achieve success in randomised clinical trials—and therefore reach patients—we propose a reassessment of the current approach to bronchiectasis. Although understanding of the pathophysiology of bronchiectasis is at an early stage, we argue that bronchiectasis is a heterogeneous disease with many different biological mechanisms that drive disease progression (endotypes), and therefore the so-called treatable traits approach used in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease could be applied to bronchiectasis, with future trials targeted at the specific disease subgroups most likely to benefit."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Early life events can affect health in later life. We hypothesised that low lung function (FEV1 <80% predicted) in early adulthood (25–40 years) is associated with higher prevalence and earlier incidence of respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic abnormalities, and premature death.
Methods
In this cohort analysis, we tested this hypothesis using data from the Framingham Offspring Cohort (FOC) and validated our observations in CARDIA (an independent cohort) and GenIII (which includes the direct descendants of FOC participants). These were three general population cohorts that included men and women, who were regularly and prospectively followed up to collect extensive clinical, physiological, biological, and imaging information. Main outcomes were prevalence (in early adulthood) and incidence (during follow-up) of comorbidity, and all-cause mortality. χ2 test, unpaired t test, Fisher's exact test, and Cox proportional hazards models were used for data analysis. Differential dropout rates during follow-up were regarded as a potential source of bias.
Findings
We found that 111 (10%) of 1161 participants in FOC, 338 (13%) of 2648 participants in CARDIA, and 71 (4%) of 1912 participants in GenIII had FEV1 of less than 80% predicted at the age of 25–40 years. These individuals also had higher prevalence of respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic abnormalities in early adulthood; higher and earlier (about a decade) incidence of comorbidities during follow-up (39 years vs 47 years in FOC; 30 years vs 37 years in CARDIA, p<0·0001); and higher all-cause mortality than individuals with normal lung function in early adulthood (in FOC, hazard ratio 2·3 [95% CI 1·4–3·7], p=0·001), which was independent of, but additive with, cumulative smoking exposure. In GenIII, we observed that individuals with at least one parent stratified as having low lung function in early adulthood in FOC (n=115) had lower FEV1 in early adulthood (10% had FEV1 of less than 80% predicted; this proportion was 3% in those with both parents classified as normal in FOC [n=248]; p<0·0001); and early adulthood FEV1 of GenIII participants was related (R2=0·28, p<0·0001) to FOC parents' average FEV1 in early adulthood.
Interpretation
Low peak lung function in early adulthood is common in the general population and could identify a group of individuals at risk of early comorbidities and premature death.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Tralokinumab is an anti-interleukin-13 human monoclonal antibody developed for the treatment of severe, uncontrolled asthma. These clinical trials aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of tralokinumab in this population.
Methods
STRATOS 1 and STRATOS 2 were randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, phase 3 clinical trials that enrolled participants aged 12–75 years with severe asthma that was inadequately controlled despite use of inhaled corticosteroids (≥500 μg per day fluticasone or equivalent) and a long-acting β2 agonist (but not oral corticosteroids). STRATOS 1 was done at 246 sites in 14 countries, and STRATOS 2 was done at 242 sites in 13 countries. In STRATOS 1, participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive tralokinumab 300 mg or matching placebo subcutaneously every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks for 52 weeks. In STRATOS 2, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive tralokinumab 300 mg or matching placebo subcutaneously every 2 weeks for 52 weeks. STRATOS 1 attempted to identify a biomarker-positive population with enhanced tralokinumab benefit, which was then tested in STRATOS 2. The primary endpoint was the annualised asthma exacerbation rate (AAER) reduction at week 52 in the all-comers population for STRATOS 1 and in the biomarker-positive population for STRATOS 2. All efficacy analyses for both trials were done on the full analysis set by an intention-to-treat approach. The safety analysis set comprised any participant who received the investigational drug and was categorised by treatment received. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT02161757 (STRATOS 1) and NCT02194699 (STRATOS 2), and with the EU Clinical Trials Register, EudraCT 2013-005614-35 (STRATOS 1) and EudraCT 2013-005615-27 (STRATOS 2).
Findings
STRATOS 1 was done between June 13, 2014, and Feb 28, 2017. 1207 participants were randomly assigned and 1202 treated as follows: tralokinumab every 2 weeks (n=398), tralokinumab every 4 weeks (n=404), or placebo (n=400). STRATOS 2 was done between Oct 30, 2014, and Sept 21, 2017. 856 participants were randomly assigned and 849 treated as follows: tralokinumab every 2 weeks (n=427) and placebo every 2 weeks (n=422). In the STRATOS 1 all-comers population, tralokinumab every 2 weeks did not significantly reduce AAER compared with placebo (7·0% reduction [95% CI −20·8 to 28·4]; rate ratio 0·93 [95% CI 0·72 to 1·21]; p=0·59). Baseline fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) 37 ppb or greater was identified as the preferred biomarker in STRATOS 1; in FENO-high participants, tralokinumab every 2 weeks (n=97) reduced AAER by 44·0% (95% CI 6·0 to 66·0; rate ratio 0·56 [95% CI 0·34 to 0·94]; p=0·028) compared with placebo (n=102). In the STRATOS 2 FENO-high population, tralokinumab every 2 weeks (n=108) did not significantly improve AAER (15·8% reduction [95% CI −33·7 to 47·0]; rate ratio 0·84 [95% CI 0·53 to 1·34]; p=0·47) compared with placebo (n=121). The safety profile was consistent with that of previous tralokinumab trials.
Interpretation
Tralokinumab reduced AAER in participants with severe asthma with baseline FENO 37 ppb or higher in STRATOS 1, but not in STRATOS 2. These inconsistent effects on AAER do not support a key role for interleukin 13 in severe asthma exacerbations.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Tuberculosis is a leading cause of global childhood mortality; however, interventions to detect undiagnosed tuberculosis in children are underused. Child contact tracing has been widely recommended but poorly implemented in resource-constrained settings. WHO has proposed a pragmatic screening approach for managing child contacts. We assessed the effectiveness of this screening approach and alternative symptom-based algorithms in identifying secondary tuberculosis in a prospectively followed cohort of Ugandan child contacts.
Methods
We identified index patients aged at least 18 years with microbiologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis at Old Mulago Hospital (Kampala, Uganda) between Oct 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2008. Households of index patients were visited by fieldworkers within 2 weeks of diagnosis. Coprevalent and incident tuberculosis were assessed in household contacts through clinical, radiographical, and microbiological examinations for 2 years. Disease rates were compared among children younger than 16 years with and without symptoms included in the WHO pragmatic guideline (presence of haemoptysis, fever, chronic cough, weight loss, night sweats, and poor appetite). Symptoms could be of any duration, except cough (>21 days) and fever (>14 days). A modified WHO decision-tree designed to detect high-risk asymptomatic child contacts was also assessed, in which all asymptomatic contacts were classified as high risk (children younger than 3 years or immunocompromised [HIV-infected]) or low risk (aged 3 years or older and immunocompetent [HIV-negative]). We also assessed a more restrictive algorithm (ie, assessing only children with presence of chronic cough and one other tuberculosis-related symptom).
Findings
Of 1718 household child contacts, 126 (7%) had coprevalent tuberculosis and 24 (1%) developed incident tuberculosis, diagnosed over the 2-year study period. Of these 150 cases of tuberculosis, 95 (63%) were microbiologically confirmed with a positive sputum culture. Using the WHO approach, 364 (21%) of 1718 child contacts had at least one tuberculosis-related symptom and 85 (23%) were identified as having coprevalent tuberculosis, 67% of all coprevalent cases detected (diagnostic odds ratio 9·8, 95% CI 6·8–14·5; p<0·0001). 1354 (79%) of 1718 child contacts had no symptoms, of whom 41 (3%) had coprevalent tuberculosis. The WHO approach was effective in contacts younger than 5 years: 70 (33%) of 211 symptomatic contacts had coprevalent disease compared with 23 (6%) of 367 asymptomatic contacts (p<0·0001). This approach was also effective in contacts aged 5 years and older: 15 (10%) of 153 symptomatic contacts had coprevalent disease compared with 18 (2%) of 987 asymptomatic contacts (p<0·0001). More coprevalent disease was detected in child contacts recommended for screening when the study population was restricted by HIV-serostatus (11 [48%] of 23 symptomatic HIV-seropositive child contacts vs two [7%] of 31 asymptomatic HIV-seropositive child contacts) or to only culture-confirmed cases (47 [13%] culture confirmed cases of 364 symptomatic child contacts vs 29 [2%] culture confirmed cases of 1354 asymptomatic child contacts). In the modified algorithm, high-risk asymptomatic child contacts were at increased risk for coprevalent disease versus low-risk asymptomatic contacts (14 [6%] of 224 vs 27 [2%] of 1130; p=0·0021). The presence of tuberculosis infection did not predict incident disease in either symptomatic or asymptomatic child contacts: in symptomatic contacts, eight (5%) of 169 infected contacts and six (5%) of 111 uninfected contacts developed incident tuberculosis (p=0·80). Among asymptomatic contacts, incident tuberculosis occurred in six (<1%) of 795 contacts infected at baseline versus four (<1%) of 518 contacts uninfected at baseline, respectively (p=1·00).
Interpretation
WHO's pragmatic, symptom-based algorithm was an effective case-finding tool, especially in children younger than 5 years. A modified decision-tree identified 6% of asymptomatic child contacts at high risk for subclinical disease. Increasing the feasibility of child-contact tracing using these approaches should be encouraged to decrease tuberculosis-related paediatric mortality in high-burden settings, but this should be partnered with increasing access to microbiological point-of-care testing.

abstract = "Summary
Background
DNA methylation profiles associated with childhood asthma might provide novel insights into disease pathogenesis. We did an epigenome-wide association study to assess methylation profiles associated with childhood asthma.
Methods
We did a large-scale epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) within the Mechanisms of the Development of ALLergy (MeDALL) project. We examined epigenome-wide methylation using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation450 BeadChips (450K) in whole blood in 207 children with asthma and 610 controls at age 4–5 years, and 185 children with asthma and 546 controls at age 8 years using a cross-sectional case-control design. After identification of differentially methylated CpG sites in the discovery analysis, we did a validation study in children (4–16 years; 247 cases and 2949 controls) from six additional European cohorts and meta-analysed the results. We next investigated whether replicated CpG sites in cord blood predict later asthma in 1316 children. We subsequently investigated cell-type-specific methylation of the identified CpG sites in eosinophils and respiratory epithelial cells and their related gene-expression signatures. We studied cell-type specificity of the asthma association of the replicated CpG sites in 455 respiratory epithelial cell samples, collected by nasal brushing of 16-year-old children as well as in DNA isolated from blood eosinophils (16 with asthma, eight controls [age 2–56 years]) and compared this with whole-blood DNA samples of 74 individuals with asthma and 93 controls (age 1–79 years). Whole-blood transcriptional profiles associated with replicated CpG sites were annotated using RNA-seq data of subsets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting.
Findings
27 methylated CpG sites were identified in the discovery analysis. 14 of these CpG sites were replicated and passed genome-wide significance (p<1·14 × 10−7) after meta-analysis. Consistently lower methylation levels were observed at all associated loci across childhood from age 4 to 16 years in participants with asthma, but not in cord blood at birth. All 14 CpG sites were significantly associated with asthma in the second replication study using whole-blood DNA, and were strongly associated with asthma in purified eosinophils. Whole-blood transcriptional signatures associated with these CpG sites indicated increased activation of eosinophils, effector and memory CD8 T cells and natural killer cells, and reduced number of naive T cells. Five of the 14 CpG sites were associated with asthma in respiratory epithelial cells, indicating cross-tissue epigenetic effects.
Interpretation
Reduced whole-blood DNA methylation at 14 CpG sites acquired after birth was strongly associated with childhood asthma. These CpG sites and their associated transcriptional profiles indicate activation of eosinophils and cytotoxic T cells in childhood asthma. Our findings merit further investigations of the role of epigenetics in a clinical context.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Heterogeneity in the progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) might reflect diversity in underlying pathobiology, and represents a major challenge in the prediction of clinical progression and treatment benefit. Previous studies have found peripheral blood concentrations of several protein biomarkers to be prognostic for overall survival duration in patients with IPF, but these findings have generally not been directly compared and replicated between cohorts. We aimed to use the pivotal trials for pirfenidone to evaluate prognostic and predictive properties of biomarkers across multiple endpoints, and whether they are modulated by pirfenidone treatment.
Methods
We did post-hoc analyses of test and replication cohorts from CAPACITY 004 (NCT00287716), CAPACITY 006 (NCT00287729), and ASCEND (NCT01366209) trials for the plasma proteins CCL13, CCL17, CCL18, CXCL13, CXCL14, COMP, interleukin 13, MMP3, MMP7, osteopontin, periostin, and YKL40. Eligible participants had IPF and received pirfenidone 2403 mg/day or placebo in CAPACITY (test cohort) or ASCEND (replication cohort), were aged 40–80 years, and without missing biomarker data at baseline. To identify biomarkers that were consistently prognostic for clinical outcome measures, the primary analysis was the association between biomarker concentrations at baseline and absolute change in percentage of predicted forced vital capacity (FVC%pred) at 12 months (CAPACITY week 48, ASCEND week 52) in the placebo group. Biomarkers within the test cohort that met predefined success criteria of a prognostic p value less than 0·10 from multivariate analysis were further assessed in the replication cohort. Furthermore, the predictive effect size (ie, biomarkers that were predictive for benefit from pirfenidone) was calculated as the difference in FVC%pred treatment effect (pirfenidone in relation to placebo) between high versus low biomarker subgroups at week 48 (test cohort) or week 52 (replication cohort).
Findings
Several baseline biomarkers (CCL13, CCL18, COMP, CXCL13, CXCL14, periostin, and YKL40) were prognostic for progression outcomes in the placebo groups of the test cohort. However, only CCL18 was consistently prognostic for absolute change in percentage of FVC%pred in both the test (p=0·032) and replication (p=0·004) cohorts. Pirfenidone treatment benefit was consistent regardless of baseline biomarker concentration.
Interpretation
Blood CCL18 concentrations were the most consistent predictor of disease progression across IPF cohorts with potential to inform new target discovery and clinical trial design. Future validation of these findings in prospective studies is warranted.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Ivacaftor is generally safe and effective in patients aged 2 years and older who have cystic fibrosis and specific CFTR mutations. We assessed its use in children aged 12 to <24 months.
Methods
The ARRIVAL study is a phase 3, single-arm, two-part, multicentre study. Eligible children were aged 12 to <24 months at enrolment and had a confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and a CFTR gating mutation on at least one allele and could participate in one or both parts of the study. Children received 50 mg (bodyweight 7 to <14 kg) or 75 mg (bodyweight ≥14 to <25 kg) ivacaftor orally every 12 h. In study part A, children received ivacaftor for 3 days plus one morning. In study part B, children received 24 weeks of treatment. Children were enrolled into part A at seven sites in Australia (one site), the UK (one), and the USA (five) and into part B at 13 sites in Australia (two sites), Canada (one), the UK (three), and the USA (seven). Primary endpoints were pharmacokinetics (part A) and safety (parts A and B) in children who received at least one dose of ivacaftor. Secondary endpoints in part B were pharmacokinetics in children who received at least one dose of ivacaftor and absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride concentration. We also explored changes in growth parameters and markers of pancreatic function. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02725567.
Findings
Children aged 12 to <24 months were enrolled between Aug 25, 2016, and Nov 1, 2017. Seven children were enrolled in part A, of whom five received 50 mg and two received 75 mg ivacaftor. All completed treatment. Of 19 children enrolled in part B, including one from part A, all received 50 mg ivacaftor and 18 completed treatment (one withdrew because of difficulty with blood draws). All children received at least one dose of ivacaftor. Pharmacokinetics indicated exposure was similar to that in children aged 2 to <6 years and adults. No children discontinued because of adverse events or safety findings. In part A, three (43%) of seven children had treatment-emergent adverse events, all of which were mild and deemed not to be or unlikely to be related to ivacaftor. By 24 weeks in part B, treatment-emergent adverse events had been reported in 18 (95%) of 19 children, of which most were mild or moderate and the most frequent was cough (14 [74%] children). Two children in part B had four serious adverse events: one had constipation (possibly related to ivacaftor), distal intestinal obstruction syndrome, and eczema herpeticum, and one had persistent cough, all needing hospital admission. In five (28%) of 18 children aspartate or alanine aminotransferase concentrations rose to more than three times the upper limit of normal (to more than eight times in two children with concurrent infections). At week 24, the mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride concentration was −73·5 (SD 17·5) mmol/L. Growth parameters for age were normal at baseline and at week 24. At week 24, concentrations of faecal elastase-1 had increased and concentrations of immunoreactive trypsinogen had decreased from baseline. Mean serum lipase and amylase were raised at baseline and rapidly decreased after treatment was started.
Interpretation
Ivacaftor was generally safe and well tolerated in children aged 12 to <24 months for up to 24 weeks and was associated with rapid and sustained reductions in sweat chloride concentrations. Improvements in biomarkers of pancreatic function suggest that ivacaftor preserves exocrine pancreatic function if started early. The study is continuing in infants younger than 12 months.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The effects of individualised perioperative lung-protective ventilation (based on the open-lung approach [OLA]) on postoperative complications is unknown. We aimed to investigate the effects of intraoperative and postoperative ventilatory management in patients scheduled for abdominal surgery, compared with standard protective ventilation.
Methods
We did this prospective, multicentre, randomised controlled trial in 21 teaching hospitals in Spain. We enrolled patients who were aged 18 years or older, were scheduled to have abdominal surgery with an expected time of longer than 2 h, had intermediate-to-high-risk of developing postoperative pulmonary complications, and who had a body-mass index less than 35 kg/m2. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) online to receive one of four lung-protective ventilation strategies using low tidal volume plus positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP): open-lung approach (OLA)–iCPAP (individualised intraoperative ventilation [individualised PEEP after a lung recruitment manoeuvre] plus individualised postoperative continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP]), OLA–CPAP (intraoperative individualised ventilation plus postoperative CPAP), STD–CPAP (standard intraoperative ventilation plus postoperative CPAP), or STD–O2 (standard intraoperative ventilation plus standard postoperative oxygen therapy). Patients were masked to treatment allocation. Investigators were not masked in the operating and postoperative rooms; after 24 h, data were given to a second investigator who was masked to allocations. The primary outcome was a composite of pulmonary and systemic complications during the first 7 postoperative days. We did the primary analysis using the modified intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02158923.
Findings
Between Jan 2, 2015, and May 18, 2016, we enrolled 1012 eligible patients. Data were available for 967 patients, whom we included in the final analysis. Risk of pulmonary and systemic complications did not differ for patients in OLA–iCPAP (110 [46%] of 241, relative risk 0·89 [95% CI 0·74–1·07; p=0·25]), OLA–CPAP (111 [47%] of 238, 0·91 [0·76–1·09; p=0·35]), or STD–CPAP groups (118 [48%] of 244, 0·95 [0·80–1·14; p=0·65]) when compared with patients in the STD–O2 group (125 [51%] of 244). Intraoperatively, PEEP was increased in 69 (14%) of patients in the standard perioperative ventilation groups because of hypoxaemia, and no patients from either of the OLA groups required rescue manoeuvres.
Interpretation
In patients who have major abdominal surgery, the different perioperative open lung approaches tested in this study did not reduce the risk of postoperative complications when compared with standard lung-protective mechanical ventilation.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Animal models of serious infection suggest that 24 h of induced hypothermia improves circulatory and respiratory function and reduces mortality. We tested the hypothesis that a reduction of core temperature to 32–34°C attenuates organ dysfunction and reduces mortality in ventilator-dependent patients with septic shock.
Methods
In this randomised, controlled, open-label trial, we recruited patients from ten intensive care units (ICUs) in three countries in Europe and North America. Inclusion criteria for patients with severe sepsis or septic shock were a mean arterial pressure of less than 70 mm Hg, mechanical ventilation in an ICU, age at least 50 years, predicted length of stay in the ICU at least 24 h, and recruitment into the study within 6 h of fulfilling inclusion criteria. Exclusion criteria were uncontrolled bleeding, clinically important bleeding disorder, recent open surgery, pregnancy or breastfeeding, or involuntary psychiatric admission. We randomly allocated patients 1:1 (with variable block sizes ranging from four to eight; stratified by predictors of mortality, age, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, and study site) to routine thermal management or 24 h of induced hypothermia (target 32–34°C) followed by 48 h of normothermia (36–38°C). The primary endpoint was 30 day all-cause mortality in the modified intention-to-treat population (all randomly allocated patients except those for whom consent was withdrawn or who were discovered to meet an exclusion criterion after randomisation but before receiving the trial intervention). Patients and health-care professionals giving the intervention were not masked to treatment allocation, but assessors of the primary outcome were. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01455116.
Findings
Between Nov 1, 2011, and Nov 4, 2016, we screened 5695 patients. After recruitment of 436 of the planned 560 participants, the trial was terminated for futility (220 [50%] randomly allocated to hypothermia and 216 [50%] to routine thermal management). In the hypothermia group, 96 (44·2%) of 217 died within 30 days versus 77 (35·8%) of 215 in the routine thermal management group (difference 8·4% [95% CI −0·8 to 17·6]; relative risk 1·2 [1·0–1·6]; p=0·07]).
Interpretation
Among patients with septic shock and ventilator-dependent respiratory failure, induced hypothermia does not reduce mortality. Induced hypothermia should not be used in patients with septic shock.

Background
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, fatal disorder with a variable disease trajectory. The aim of this study was to assess potential biomarkers to predict outcomes for people with IPF.
Methods
PROFILE is a large prospective longitudinal cohort of treatment-naive patients with IPF. We adopted a two-stage discovery and validation design using patients from the PROFILE cohort. For the discovery analysis, we examined 106 patients and 50 age and sex matched healthy controls from Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and the Royal Brompton Hospital. We did an unbiased, multiplex immunoassay assessment of 123 biomarkers. We further investigated promising novel markers by immunohistochemical assessment of IPF lung tissue. In the validation analysis, we examined samples from 206 people with IPF from among the remaining 212 patients recruited to PROFILE Central England. We used the samples to attempt to replicate the biomarkers identified from the discovery analysis by use of independent immunoassays for each biomarker. We investigated the predictive power of the selected biomarkers to identify individuals with IPF who were at risk of progression or death. The PROFILE studies are registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT01134822 (PROFILE Central England) and NCT01110694 (PROFILE Royal Brompton Hospital).
Findings
In the discovery analysis, we identified four serum biomarkers (surfactant protein D, matrix metalloproteinase 7, CA19-9, and CA-125) that were suitable for replication. Histological assessment of CA19-9 and CA-125 suggested that these proteins were markers of epithelial damage. Replication analysis showed that baseline values of surfactant protein D (46·6 ng/mL vs 34·6 ng/mL, p=0·0018) and CA19-9 (53·7 U/mL vs 22·2 U/mL; p<0·0001) were significantly higher in patients with progressive disease than in patients with stable disease, and rising concentrations of CA-125 over 3 months were associated with increased risk of mortality (HR 2·542, 95% CI 1·493–4·328, p=0·00059).
Interpretation
We have identified serum proteins secreted from metaplastic epithelium that can be used to predict disease progression and death in IPF.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2017 classification separates the spirometric 1–4 staging from the ABCD groups defined by symptoms and exacerbations. Little is known about how this new classification predicts mortality in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We aimed to establish the predictive ability of the GOLD 2017 classification, compared with earlier classifications, for all-cause and respiratory mortality, both when using its main ABCD groups and when further subdividing according to spirometric 1–4 staging.
Methods
In this nationwide cohort study, we enrolled patients with COPD with data available in the Danish registry for COPD. To be included in this registry, individuals must have been outpatients in hospital-based pulmonary clinics in Denmark. Eligible patients were aged 30 years or older; had received a primary diagnosis of COPD (International Classification of Diseases [ICD]-10 J44.X) or acute respiratory failure (ICD-10 J96.X) in combination with COPD (ICD-10 J44.X) as a secondary diagnosis; and had complete data on FEV1, body-mass index, modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale score, and smoking status. We categorised eligible patients with complete data according to the 2007, 2011, and 2017 GOLD classifications at the first contact with an outpatient clinic. For the GOLD 2017 classification, we further subdivided the patients by spirometry into 16 subgroups (1A to 4D). We calculated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause and respiratory mortality and compared the predictive ability of the three GOLD classifications (2007, 2011, and 2017) using receiver operating curves.
Findings
We enrolled 33 765 patients with COPD, who were outpatients in Danish hospitals between Jan 1, 2008, and Nov 30, 2013, in the main cohort assessed for all-cause mortality. 22 621 of these patients had data available on cause-specific mortality (respiratory) and were included in a subcohort followed from Jan 1, 2008, to Dec 31, 2011. For the GOLD 2017 classification, 3 year mortality increased with increasing exacerbations and dyspnoea from group A (all-cause mortality 10·0%, respiratory mortality 3·0%) to group D (all-cause mortality 36·9%, respiratory mortality 18·0%). However, 3 year mortality was higher for group B patients (all-cause mortality 23·8%, respiratory mortality 9·7%) than for group C patients (all-cause mortality 17·4%, respiratory mortality 6·4%). Compared with group A, adjusted HRs for all-cause mortality ranged from 2·05 (95% CI 1·87–2·26) for group B, to 1·47 (1·31–1·65) for group C, and to 3·01 (2·75–3·30) for group D. Area under the curve for all-cause mortality was 0·61 (95% CI 0·60–0·61) for GOLD 2007, 0·61 (0·60–0·62) for GOLD 2011, and 0·63 (0·53–0·73) for GOLD 2017. Area under the curve for respiratory mortality was 0·64 (0·62–0·65) for GOLD 2007, 0·63 (0·62–0·64) for GOLD 2011, and 0·65 (0·53–0·78) for GOLD 2017. The GOLD 2017 classification based on ABCD groups only did not predict mortality better than the earlier 2007 and 2011 GOLD classifications. However, when 16 subgroups (1A to 4D) were defined, the new classification predicted mortality more accurately than the previous systems (p<0·0001).
Interpretation
We showed that the new GOLD 2017 ABCD classification does not predict all-cause and respiratory mortality more accurately than the previous GOLD systems from 2007 and 2011.

abstract = "Summary
Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a diffuse lung disease that results from the accumulation of lipoproteinaceous material in the alveoli and alveolar macrophages due to abnormal surfactant homoeostasis. Identification of the granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as an indispensable mediator of macrophage maturation and surfactant catabolism was the key discovery leading to the current understanding of the pathogenesis of most forms of PAP. Impaired GM-CSF bioavailability due to anti-GM-CSF autoimmunity is the cause of approximately 90% of adult PAP cases. Abnormal macrophage function due to endogenous or exogenous triggers, GM-CSF receptor defects, and other genetic abnormalities of surfactant production account for the remainder of causes. The usual physiological consequence of PAP is impairment of gas exchange, which can lead to dyspnoea, hypoxaemia, or even respiratory failure and death. Pulmonary fibrosis occurs occasionally in patients with PAP. For patients with moderate to severe disease, whole lung lavage is still the first-line treatment of choice. Supplemental GM-CSF is also useful, but details about indications, choice of agent, and dosing remain unclear. Other therapies, including rituximab, plasmapheresis, and lung transplantation have been described but should be reserved for refractory cases."

Background
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is associated with subsequent wheeze and asthma. We previously reported on the causal relationship between prevention of RSV infection during infancy and reduced frequency of subsequent wheeze using a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial (MAKI). We continued follow-up and analysed the effect of RSV prevention during infancy on asthma and lung function at age 6 years.
Methods
We studied 429 infants born at 32–35 weeks of gestation between 2008–10 who had randomly received either palivizumab for RSV immunoprophylaxis or placebo during the RSV season of their first year of life. After the first year of follow-up, single, assessor-blind follow-up of children continued until they were aged 6 years. Primary outcomes were parent-reported current asthma and forced expiratory volume in 0·5 s (FEV0·5). The trial is registered in the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN73641710.
Findings
395 (92%) of 429 participants completed this 6-year follow-up study. Parent-reported current asthma was reported in 28 (14·1%) of 199 children in the RSV prevention group and 47 (24·0%) of 196 children in the placebo group (absolute risk reduction [ARR] 9·9%, 95% CI 2·2 to 17·6). The difference in current asthma, which was a composite endpoint, was due to a difference in infrequent wheeze (one to three episodes in the past year; 12 [6·0%] of 199 vs 26 [13·4%] of 194, ARR 7·4%, 95% CI 1·5 to 13·2). FEV0·5 percentage predicted values were similar between the RSV prevention group (89·1% [SD 10·6]) and placebo group (90·1% [11·1]), with a mean difference of 1·0 (95% CI −1·3 to 3·3). The proportion of children with current physician-diagnosed asthma was similar between the RSV prevention group (19 [10·3%] of 185) and placebo group (18 [9·9%] of 182), with an ARR of −0·4 (95% CI −6·5 to 5·8).
Interpretation
In otherwise healthy preterm infants, this single-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial showed that RSV prevention did not have a major effect on current asthma or lung function at age 6 years. Future research will inform on the effect of RSV prevention on asthma at school age in the general population.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Isoniazid-resistant, rifampicin-susceptible (INH-R) tuberculosis is the most common form of drug resistance, and is associated with failure, relapse, and acquired rifampicin resistance if treated with first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. The aim of the study was to compare success, mortality, and acquired rifampicin resistance in patients with INH-R pulmonary tuberculosis given different durations of rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide (REZ); a fluoroquinolone plus 6 months or more of REZ; and streptomycin plus a core regimen of REZ.
Methods
Studies with regimens and outcomes known for individual patients with INH-R tuberculosis were eligible, irrespective of the number of patients if randomised trials, or with at least 20 participants if a cohort study. Studies were identified from two relevant systematic reviews, an updated search of one of the systematic reviews (for papers published between April 1, 2015, and Feb 10, 2016), and personal communications. Individual patient data were obtained from authors of eligible studies. The individual patient data meta-analysis was performed with propensity score matched logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and risk differences of treatment success (cure or treatment completion), death during treatment, and acquired rifampicin resistance. Outcomes were measured across different treatment regimens to assess the effects of: different durations of REZ (≤6 months vs >6 months); addition of a fluoroquinolone to REZ (fluoroquinolone plus 6 months or more of REZ vs 6 months or more of REZ); and addition of streptomycin to REZ (streptomycin plus 6 months of rifampicin and ethambutol and 1–3 months of pyrazinamide vs 6 months or more of REZ). The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE methodology.
Findings
Individual patient data were requested for 57 cohort studies and 17 randomised trials including 8089 patients with INH-R tuberculosis. We received 33 datasets with 6424 patients, of which 3923 patients in 23 studies received regimens related to the study objectives. Compared with a daily regimen of 6 months of (H)REZ (REZ with or without isoniazid), extending the duration to 8–9 months had similar outcomes; as such, 6 months or more of (H)REZ was used for subsequent comparisons. Addition of a fluoroquinolone to 6 months or more of (H)REZ was associated with significantly greater treatment success (aOR 2·8, 95% CI 1·1–7·3), but no significant effect on mortality (aOR 0·7, 0·4–1·1) or acquired rifampicin resistance (aOR 0·1, 0·0–1·2). Compared with 6 months or more of (H)REZ, the standardised retreatment regimen (2 months of streptomycin, 3 months of pyrazinamide, and 8 months of isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol) was associated with significantly worse treatment success (aOR 0·4, 0·2–0·7). The quality of the evidence was very low for all outcomes and treatment regimens assessed, owing to the observational nature of most of the data, the diverse settings, and the imprecision of estimates.
Interpretation
In patients with INH-R tuberculosis, compared with treatment with at least 6 months of daily REZ, addition of a fluoroquinolone was associated with better treatment success, whereas addition of streptomycin was associated with less treatment success; however, the quality of the evidence was very low. These results support the conduct of randomised trials to identify the optimum regimen for this important and common form of drug-resistant tuberculosis.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Lifetime lung function is related to quality of life and longevity. Over the lifespan, individuals follow different lung function trajectories. Identification of these trajectories, their determinants, and outcomes is important, but no study has done this beyond the fourth decade.
Methods
We used six waves of the Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study (TAHS) to model lung function trajectories measured at 7, 13, 18, 45, 50, and 53 years. We analysed pre-bronchodilator FEV1 z-scores at the six timepoints using group-based trajectory modelling to identify distinct subgroups of individuals whose measurements followed a similar pattern over time. We related the trajectories identified to childhood factors and risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using logistic regression, and estimated population-attributable fractions of COPD.
Findings
Of the 8583 participants in the original cohort, 2438 had at least two waves of lung function data at age 7 years and 53 years and comprised the study population. We identified six trajectories: early below average, accelerated decline (97 [4%] participants); persistently low (136 [6%] participants); early low, accelerated growth, normal decline (196 [8%] participants); persistently high (293 [12%] participants); below average (772 [32%] participants); and average (944 [39%] participants). The three trajectories early below average, accelerated decline; persistently low; and below average had increased risk of COPD at age 53 years compared with the average group (early below average, accelerated decline: odds ratio 35·0, 95% CI 19·5–64·0; persistently low: 9·5, 4·5–20·6; and below average: 3·7, 1·9–6·9). Early-life predictors of the three trajectories included childhood asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, allergic rhinitis, eczema, parental asthma, and maternal smoking. Personal smoking and active adult asthma increased the impact of maternal smoking and childhood asthma, respectively, on the early below average, accelerated decline trajectory.
Interpretation
We identified six potential FEV1 trajectories, two of which were novel. Three trajectories contributed 75% of COPD burden and were associated with modifiable early-life exposures whose impact was aggravated by adult factors. We postulate that reducing maternal smoking, encouraging immunisation, and avoiding personal smoking, especially in those with smoking parents or low childhood lung function, might minimise COPD risk. Clinicians and patients with asthma should be made aware of the potential long-term implications of non-optimal asthma control for lung function trajectory throughout life, and the role and benefit of optimal asthma control on improving lung function should be investigated in future intervention trials.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Young children have immature immune systems and respond poorly to standard influenza vaccines. The oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant MF59 can increase antigen uptake, macrophage recruitment, lymph node migration, and avidity to influenza virus. Therefore, we aimed to assess the relative efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of an MF59-adjuvanted, quadrivalent, inactivated (subunit) influenza vaccine (aIIV4) compared with a US-licensed non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine in children.
Methods
We did a multicentre, randomised controlled, observer-blinded, phase 3 trial of 146 sites including hospitals, clinics, and clinician offices in nine countries over two influenza seasons. We included children of either sex aged 6 months through 5 years. We stratified eligible participants and randomly assigned them (1:1), using a block size of four, to receive either aIIV4 or non-adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (ie, trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine [IIV3] or quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine [IIV4]). We masked participants, parents or guardians, and outcome assessors to the administered vaccine. Designated personnel who were not masked administered aIIV4 in both seasons, or IIV3 in season one and IIV4 in season two. All vaccinations were administered intramuscularly. Children aged 6 through 35 months received one or two 0·25 mL doses, whereas those aged 3 through 5 years received one or two doses of 0·5 mL. The number of doses was dependent on previous vaccination status: vaccine-naive participants received a total of two doses of study vaccine, the first on day 1 and the second on day 29, whereas non-naive participants received only one dose on day 1. The primary outcome was relative vaccine efficacy assessed by RT-PCR-confirmed influenza due to any influenza strain in the overall study population and in prespecified age and dose subgroups. Immunogenicity against homologous and heterologous strains of influenza and safety were also measured. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01964989.
Findings
Between Nov 3, 2013, and March 5, 2014 (season one), and between Sept 30, 2014, and March 29, 2015 (season two), 10 644 participants were enrolled in this study. Of these participants, 10 612 were vaccinated (n=5338 with aIIV4 and n=5274 with comparator). Relative vaccine efficacy was not different between aIIV4 and the comparator vaccines in the overall study population (relative vaccine efficacy −0·67, 95% CI −19·81 to 15·41). The relative vaccine efficacy in the 6 through 23-month subgroup was significantly greater for aIIV4 than for the comparator vaccine (relative vaccine efficacy 31·37, 95% CI 3·14–51·38). aIIV4 elicited superior immunogenic response compared with the comparator for all four vaccine strains (geometric mean titre ratios 1·91 [95% CI 1·8–2·0] for A/H1N1, 1·71 [1·6–1·8] for A/H3N2, 2·19 [2·0–2·4] for B/Yamagata, and 2·27 [2·0–2·6] for B/Victoria) and three heterologous strains (1·94 [1·6–2·3] for A/H3N2, 2·17 [1·8–2·6] for B/Yamagata, and 2·12 [1·6–2·7] for B/Victoria) in participants aged 6 months through 5 years. The highest geometric mean titre ratios were observed in participants aged 6 through 23 months. Safety profiles were similar but more frequent solicited adverse events were reported with aIIV4 than with the comparator (3748 [73%] of 5138 vs 3242 [64%] of 5056).
Interpretation
Although there was no additional benefit of aIIV4 compared with the US-licensed non-adjuvanted influenza vaccines in the overall study population, in the youngest and most vulnerable population of children in this trial, aIIV4 provided greater protection against influenza than a non-adjuvanted vaccine when assessed in this prespecified age group of 6 through 23 months. Additional clinical benefit was also apparent early after first vaccination in vaccine-naive participants aged 6 months through 5 years. Finally, aIIV4 and comparator had similar efficacy and vaccine safety profiles in children aged 6 months through 5 years.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Increased concentrations of eosinophils in blood and sputum in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been associated with increased frequency of exacerbations, reduced lung function, and corticosteroid responsiveness. We aimed to assess whether high eosinophil concentrations in either sputum or blood are associated with a severe COPD phenotype, including greater exacerbation frequency, and whether blood eosinophils are predictive of sputum eosinophils.
Methods
We did a multicentre observational study analysing comprehensive baseline data from SPIROMICS in patients with COPD aged 40–80 years who had a smoking history of at least 20 pack-years, recruited from six clinical sites and additional subsites in the USA between Nov 12, 2010, and April 21, 2015. Inclusion criteria for this analysis were SPIROMICS baseline visit data with complete blood cell counts and, in a subset, acceptable sputum counts. We stratified patients on the basis of blood and sputum eosinophil concentrations and compared their demographic characteristics, as well as results from questionnaires, clinical assessments, and quantitative CT (QCT). We also analysed whether blood eosinophil concentrations reliably predicted sputum eosinophil concentrations. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01969344).
Findings
Of the 2737 patients recruited to SPIROMICS, 2499 patients were smokers and had available blood counts, and so were stratified by mean blood eosinophil count: 1262 patients with low (<200 cells per μL) and 1237 with high (≥200 cells per μL) blood eosinophil counts. 827 patients were eligible for stratification by mean sputum eosinophil percentage: 656 with low (<1·25%) and 171 with high (≥1·25%) sputum eosinophil percentages. The high sputum eosinophil group had significantly lower median FEV1 percentage predicted than the low sputum eosinophil group both before (65·7% [IQR 51·8–81·3] vs 75·7% [59·3–90·2], p<0·0001) and after (77·3% [63·1–88·5] vs 82·9% [67·8–95·9], p=0·001) bronchodilation. QCT density measures for emphysema and air trapping were significantly higher in the high sputum eosinophil group than the low sputum eosinophil group. Exacerbations requiring corticosteroids treatment were more common in the high versus low sputum eosinophil group (p=0·002). FEV1 percentage predicted was significantly different between low and high blood eosinophil groups, but differences were less than those observed between the sputum groups. The high blood eosinophil group had slightly increased airway wall thickness (0·02 mm difference, p=0·032), higher St George Respiratory Questionnaire symptom scores (p=0·037), and increased wheezing (p=0·018), but no evidence of an association with COPD exacerbations (p=0·35) or the other indices of COPD severity, such as emphysema measured by CT density, COPD assessment test scores, Body-mass index, airflow Obstruction, Dyspnea, and Exercise index, or Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stage. Blood eosinophil counts showed a weak but significant association with sputum eosinophil counts (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0·64, p<0·0001), but with a high false-discovery rate of 72%.
Interpretation
In a large, well characterised cohort of former and current smoking patients with a broad range of COPD severity, high concentrations of sputum eosinophils were a better biomarker than high concentrations of blood eosinophils to identify a patient subgroup with more severe disease, more frequent exacerbations, and increased emphysema by QCT. Blood eosinophils alone were not a reliable biomarker for COPD severity or exacerbations, or for sputum eosinophils. Clinical trials targeting eosinophilic inflammation in COPD should consider assessing sputum eosinophils.

Background
Tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody, initially showed good activity when used alone in patients with mesothelioma, but did not improve the overall survival of patients who failed on first-line or second-line chemotherapy compared with placebo in the DETERMINE study. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of first-line or second-line tremelimumab combined with durvalumab, an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, in patients with malignant mesothelioma.
Methods
In this open-label, non-randomised, phase 2 trial, patients with unresectable pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma received intravenous tremelimumab (1 mg/kg bodyweight) and durvalumab (20 mg/kg bodyweight) every 4 weeks for four doses, followed by maintenance intravenous durvalumab at the same dose and schedule for nine doses. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with an immune-related objective response according to the immune-related modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST; for pleural mesothelioma) or immune-related RECIST version 1.1 (for peritoneal mesothelioma). The primary analysis was done by intention to treat, whereas the safety analysis included patients who received at least one dose of study drug.

From Oct 30, 2015, to Oct 12, 2016, 40 patients with mesothelioma were enrolled and received at least one dose each of tremelimumab and durvalumab. Patients were followed-up for a median of 19·2 months (IQR 13·8–20·5). 11 (28%) of 40 patients had an immune-related objective response (all partial responses; confirmed in ten patients), with a median response duration of 16·1 months (IQR 11·5–20·5). 26 (65%) patients had immune-related disease control and 25 (63%) had disease control. Median immune-related progression-free survival was 8·0 months (95% CI 6·7–9·3), median progression-free survival was 5·7 months (1·7–9·7), and median overall survival was 16·6 months (13·1–20·1). Baseline tumour PD-L1 expression did not correlate with the proportion of patients who had an immune-related objective response or immune-related disease control, with immune-related progression-free survival, or with overall survival. 30 (75%) patients experienced treatment-related adverse events of any grade, of whom seven (18%) had grade 3–4 treatment-related adverse events. Treatment-related toxicity was generally manageable and reversible with protocol guidelines.
Interpretation
The combination of tremelimumab and durvalumab appeared active, with a good safety profile in patients with mesothelioma, warranting further exploration.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) risk has a strong genetic component. Studies have implicated variations at several loci, including TERT, surfactant genes, and a single nucleotide polymorphism at chr11p15 (rs35705950) in the intergenic region between TOLLIP and MUC5B. Patients with IPF who have risk alleles at rs35705950 have longer survival from the time of IPF diagnosis than do patients homozygous for the non-risk allele, whereas patients with shorter telomeres have shorter survival times. We aimed to assess whether rare protein-altering variants in genes regulating telomere length are enriched in patients with IPF homozygous for the non-risk alleles at rs35705950.
Methods
Between Nov 1, 2014, and Nov 1, 2016, we assessed blood samples from patients aged 40 years or older and of European ancestry with sporadic IPF from three international phase 3 clinical trials (INSPIRE, CAPACITY, ASCEND), one phase 2 study (RIFF), and US-based observational studies (Vanderbilt Clinical Interstitial Lung Disease Registry and the UCSF Interstitial Lung Disease Clinic registry cohorts) at the Broad Institute (Cambridge, MA, USA) and Human Longevity (San Diego, CA, USA). We also assessed blood samples from non-IPF controls in several clinical trials. We did whole-genome sequencing to assess telomere length and identify rare protein-altering variants, stratified by rs35705950 genotype. We also assessed rare functional variation in TERT exons and compared telomere length and disease progression across genotypes.
Findings
We assessed samples from 1510 patients with IPF and 1874 non-IPF controls. 30 (3%) of 1046 patients with an rs35705950 risk allele had a rare protein-altering variant in TERT compared with 34 (7%) of 464 non-risk allele carriers (odds ratio 0·40 [95% CI 0·24–0·66], p=0·00039). Subsequent analyses identified enrichment of rare protein-altering variants in PARN and RTEL1, and rare variation in TERC in patients with IPF compared with controls. We expanded our study population to provide a more accurate estimation of rare variant frequency in these four loci, and to calculate telomere length. The proportion of patients with at least one rare variant in TERT, PARN, TERC, or RTEL1 was higher in patients with IPF than in controls (149 [9%] of 1739 patients vs 205 [2%] of 8645 controls, p=2·44 × 10−8). Patients with IPF who had a variant in any of the four identified telomerase component genes had telomeres that were 3·69–16·10% shorter than patients without a variant in any of the four genes and had an earlier mean age of disease onset than patients without one or more variants (65·1 years [SD 7·8] vs 67·1 years [7·9], p=0·004). In the placebo arms of clinical trials, shorter telomeres were significantly associated with faster disease progression (1·7% predicted forced vital capacity per kb per year, p=0·002). Pirfenidone had treatment benefit regardless of telomere length (p=4·24 × 10−8 for telomere length lower than the median, p=0·0044 for telomere length greater than the median).
Interpretation
Rare protein-altering variants in TERT, PARN, TERC, and RTEL1 are enriched in patients with IPF compared with controls, and, in the case of TERT, particularly in individuals without a risk allele at the rs35705950 locus. This suggests that multiple genetic factors contribute to sporadic IPF, which might implicate distinct mechanisms of pathogenesis and disease progression.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Pulmonary hyperinflation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with reduced biventricular end-diastolic volumes and increased morbidity and mortality. The combination of a long-acting β agonist (LABA) and a muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) is more effective in reducing hyperinflation than LABA–inhaled corticosteroid combination therapy but whether dual bronchodilation improves cardiac function is unknown.
Methods
We did a double-blind, randomised, two-period crossover, placebo-controlled, single-centre study (CLAIM) at the Fraunhofer Institute of Toxicology and Experimental Medicine (Hannover, Germany), a specialty clinic. Eligible participants were patients aged at least 40 years with COPD, pulmonary hyperinflation (defined by a baseline residual volume >135% of predicted), a smoking history of at least ten pack-years, and airflow limitation (FEV1 <80% predicted and post-bronchodilator FEV1: forced vital capacity <0·7). Patients with stable cardiovascular disease were eligible, but those with arrhythmias, heart failure, unstable ischaemic heart disease, or uncontrolled hypertension were not. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to either receive a combined inhaled dual bronchodilator containing the LABA indacaterol (110 μg as maleate salt) plus the LAMA glycopyrronium (50 μg as bromide salt) once per day for 14 days, followed by a 14-day washout, then a matched placebo for 14 days, or to receive the same treatments in reverse order. The randomisation was done using lists and was concealed from patients and investigators. The primary endpoint was the effect of indacaterol–glycopyrronium versus placebo on left-ventricular end-diastolic volume measured by MRI done on day 1 (visit 4) and day 15 (visit 5) in treatment period 1 and on day 29 (visit 6) and day 43 (visit 7) in treatment period 2 in the per-protocol population. Left-ventricular end-diastolic volume was indexed to body surface area. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of the study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02442206.
Findings
Between May 18, 2015, and April 20, 2017, we randomly assigned 62 eligible participants to treatment; 30 to indacaterol–glycopyrronium followed by placebo and 32 to placebo followed by indacaterol–glycopyrronium. The 62 randomly assigned patients were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. There were two protocol violations and therefore 60 were included in the per-protocol analysis. 57 patients completed both treatment periods. After indacaterol–glycopyrronium treatment, left-ventricular end-diastolic volume increased from a mean 55·46 mL/m2 (SD 15·89) at baseline to a least-squares (LS) mean of 61·76 mL/m2 (95% CI 57·68–65·84), compared with a change from 56·42 mL/m2 at baseline (13·54) to 56·53 mL/m2 (52·43–60·62) after placebo (LS means treatment difference 5·23 mL/m2 [95% CI 3·22 to 7·25; p<0·0001]). The most common adverse events reported with indacaterol–glycopyrronium were cough (in nine patients [15%] of 59) and throat irritation (in seven [12%]). With placebo, the most common adverse events reported were headache (in five patients [8%] of 61) and upper respiratory tract infection (in four [7%]). Two patients had serious adverse events: one (2%) after indacaterol–glycopyrronium (endometrial cancer) and one (2%) after placebo (myocardial infarction); these were not thought to be treatment related. No patients died during the study.
Interpretation
This is the first study to analyse the effect of LABA–LAMA combination therapy on cardiac function in patients with COPD and lung hyperinflation. Dual bronchodilation with indacaterol–glycopyrronium significantly improved cardiac function as measured by left-ventricular end-diastolic volume. The results are important because of the known association of cardiovascular impairment with COPD, and support the early use of dual bronchodilation in patients with COPD who show signs of pulmonary hyperinflation.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Indwelling pleural catheters are an established management option for malignant pleural effusion and have advantages over talc slurry pleurodesis. The optimal regimen of drainage after indwelling pleural catheter insertion is debated and ranges from aggressive (daily) drainage to drainage only when symptomatic.
Methods
AMPLE-2 was an open-label randomised trial involving 11 centres in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Malaysia. Patients with symptomatic malignant pleural effusions were randomly assigned (1:1) to the aggressive (daily) or symptom-guided drainage groups for 60 days and minimised by cancer type (mesothelioma vs others), performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] score 0–1 vs ≥2), presence of trapped lung, and prior pleurodesis. Patients were followed up for 6 months. The primary outcome was mean daily breathlessness score, measured by use of a 100 mm visual analogue scale during the first 60 days. Secondary outcomes included rates of spontaneous pleurodesis and self-reported quality-of-life measures. Results were analysed by an intention-to-treat approach. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12615000963527.
Findings
Between July 20, 2015, and Jan 26, 2017, 87 patients were recruited and randomly assigned to the aggressive (n=43) or symptom-guided (n=44) drainage groups. The mean daily breathlessness scores did not differ significantly between the aggressive and symptom-guided drainage groups (geometric means 13·1 mm [95% CI 9·8–17·4] vs 17·3 mm [13·0–22·0]; ratio of geometric means 1·32 [95% CI 0·88–1·97]; p=0·18). More patients in the aggressive group developed spontaneous pleurodesis than in the symptom-guided group in the first 60 days (16 [37·2%] of 43 vs five [11·4%] of 44, p=0·0049) and at 6 months (19 [44·2%] vs seven [15·9%], p=0·004; hazard ratio 3·287 [95% CI 1·396–7·740]; p=0·0065). Patient-reported quality-of-life measures, assessed with EuroQoL-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L), were better in the aggressive group than in the symptom-guided group (estimated means 0·713 [95% CI 0·647–0·779] vs 0·601 [0·536–0·667]). The estimated difference in means was 0·112 (95% CI 0·0198–0·204; p=0·0174). Pain scores, total days spent in hospital, and mortality did not differ significantly between groups. Serious adverse events occurred in 11 (25·6%) of 43 patients in the aggressive drainage group and in 12 (27·3%) of 44 patients in the symptom-guided drainage group, including 11 episodes of pleural infection in nine patients (five in the aggressive group and six in the symptom-guided drainage group).
Interpretation
We found no differences between the aggressive (daily) and the symptom-guided drainage regimens for indwelling pleural catheters in providing breathlessness control. These data indicate that daily indwelling pleural catheter drainage is more effective in promoting spontaneous pleurodesis and might improve quality of life.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Because of the rapid change in economic development and lifestyle in China, and the ageing population, concerns have grown that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) could become epidemic. An up-to-date nationwide estimation of COPD prevalence in China is needed.
Methods
We did a cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of individuals from mainland China aged 40 years or older. The primary outcome was COPD, defined according to the 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) lung function criteria.
Findings
Between Dec 29, 2014, and Dec 31, 2015, 66 752 adults were recruited to the study population. The estimated standardised prevalence of COPD was 13·6% (95% CI 12·0–15·2). The prevalence of COPD differed significantly between men and women (19·0%, 95% CI 16·9–21·2 vs 8·1%, 6·8–9·3; p<0·0001), mainly because of a significant difference in smoking status between men and women (current smokers 58·2% vs 4·0%). The prevalence of COPD differed by geographic region, with the highest prevalence in southwest China (20·2%, 95% CI 14·7–25·8) and the lowest in central China (10·2%, 8·2–12·2). Among adults with COPD, 56·4% (95% CI 53·7–59·2) had mild disease (GOLD stage I), 36·3% (34·3–38·3) had moderate disease (GOLD stage II), 6·5% (5·5–7·4) had severe disease (GOLD stage III), and 0·9% (0·6–1·1) had very severe disease (GOLD stage IV).
Interpretation
In a large, nationally representative sample of adults aged 40 years or older, the estimated overall prevalence of COPD in China in 2014–15 was 13·6%, indicating that this disease has become a major public-health problem. Strategies aimed at prevention and treatment of COPD are needed urgently.

abstract = "Summary
Background
A serious adverse effect of corticosteroid therapy is adrenal suppression. Our aim was to identify genetic variants affecting susceptibility to corticosteroid-induced adrenal suppression.
Methods
We enrolled children with asthma who used inhaled corticosteroids as part of their treatment from 25 sites across the UK (discovery cohort), as part of the Pharmacogenetics of Adrenal Suppression with Inhaled Steroids (PASS) study. We included two validation cohorts, one comprising children with asthma (PASS study) and the other consisting of adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) who were recruited from two UK centres for the Pharmacogenomics of Adrenal Suppression in COPD (PASIC) study. Participants underwent a low-dose short synacthen test. Adrenal suppression was defined as peak cortisol less than 350 nmol/L (in children) and less than 500 nmol/L (in adults). A case-control genome-wide association study was done with the control subset augmented by Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 (WTCCC2) participants. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that fulfilled criteria to be advanced to replication were tested by a random-effects inverse variance meta-analysis. This report presents the primary analysis. The PASS study is registered in the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA). The PASS study is complete whereas the PASIC study is ongoing.
Findings
Between November, 2008, and September, 2011, 499 children were enrolled to the discovery cohort. Between October, 2011, and December, 2012, 81 children were enrolled to the paediatric validation cohort, and from February, 2010, to June, 2015, 78 adults were enrolled to the adult validation cohort. Adrenal suppression was present in 35 (7%) children in the discovery cohort and six (7%) children and 17 (22%) adults in the validation cohorts. In the discovery cohort, 40 SNPs were found to be associated with adrenal suppression (genome-wide significance p<1 × 10−6), including an intronic SNP within the PDGFD gene locus (rs591118; odds ratio [OR] 7·32, 95% CI 3·15–16·99; p=5·8 × 10−8). This finding for rs591118 was validated successfully in both the paediatric asthma (OR 3·86, 95% CI 1·19–12·50; p=0·02) and adult COPD (2·41, 1·10–5·28; p=0·03) cohorts. The proportions of patients with adrenal suppression by rs591118 genotype were six (3%) of 214 patients with the GG genotype, 15 (6%) of 244 with the AG genotype, and 22 (25%) of 87 with the AA genotype. Meta-analysis of the paediatric cohorts (discovery and validation) and all three cohorts showed genome-wide significance of rs591118 (respectively, OR 5·89, 95% CI 2·97–11·68; p=4·3 × 10−9; and 4·05, 2·00–8·21; p=3·5 × 10−10).
Interpretation
Our findings suggest that genetic variation in the PDGFD gene locus increases the risk of adrenal suppression in children and adults who use corticosteroids to treat asthma and COPD, respectively.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The peripheral blood eosinophil count might help identify those patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who will experience fewer exacerbations when taking inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Previous post-hoc analyses have proposed eosinophil cutoffs that are both arbitrary and limited in evaluating complex interactions of treatment response. We modelled eosinophil count as a continuous variable to determine the characteristics that determine both exacerbation risk and clinical response to ICS in patients with COPD.
Methods
We analysed data from three AstraZeneca randomised controlled trials of budesonide–formoterol in patients with COPD with a history of exacerbations and available blood eosinophil counts. Patients with any history of asthma were excluded. Negative binomial regression analysis was done using splines for modelling of continuous variables to study the primary outcome of annual exacerbation rate adjusted for exposure time and study design. The trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00206167, NCT00206154, and NCT00419744.
Findings
4528 patients were studied. A non-linear increase in exacerbations occurred with increasing eosinophil count in patients who received formoterol alone. At eosinophil counts of 0·10 × 109 cells per L or more, a significant treatment effect was recorded for exacerbation reduction with budesonide–formoterol compared with formoterol alone (rate ratio 0·75, 95% CI 0·57–0·99; pinteraction=0·015). Interactions were observed between eosinophil count and the treatment effects of budesonide–formoterol over formoterol on St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (pinteraction=0·0043) and pre-bronchodilator FEV1 (linear effect p<0·0001, pinteraction=0·067). Only eosinophil count and smoking history were independent predictors of response to budesonide–formoterol in reducing exacerbations (eosinophil count, pinteraction=0·013; smoking history, pinteraction=0·015).
Interpretation
In patients with COPD treated with formoterol, blood eosinophil count predicts exacerbation risk and the clinical response to ICS.

Background
Osimertinib is approved for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer in patients who develop the EGFR Thr790Met mutation after treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs). We assessed outcomes in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer and the EGFR Thr790Met mutation who were treated with osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR TKI, after previous treatment failure with one or more other EGFR TKIs.
Methods
Eligible patients had been enrolled at one centre in the AURA study, had shown resistance to a previous EGFR TKI, and had EGFR-activating mutations and acquired Thr790Met mutation detectable in tumour tissue or plasma. Patients took 20–240 mg osimertinib per day until disease progression or development of intolerable side-effects. Plasma samples were collected every 6 weeks and tumour tissue biopsy was done at study entry and was optional after disease progression. We tested samples for resistance mechanisms, including EGFR-activating, Thr790Met, and Cys797Ser mutations, and assessed associations with overall survival, progression-free survival, and survival after disease progression.
Findings
Of 71 patients enrolled in AURA, 53 were eligible for this analysis. Median progression-free survival was 11·1 months (95% CI 8·4–13·9) and overall survival was 16·9 months (11·7–29·1). 47 patients had disease progression. Median overall survival after osimertinib progression was 5·4 months (95% CI 4·1–10·0). Plasma samples were available for 40 patients after disease progression. 12 (30%) of these had the Thr790Met mutation (four of whom also had Cys797Ser mutations). Patients without detectable EGFR-activating mutations in plasma before treatment had the best overall and post-progression survival (22·4 months, 95% CI 15·6–not reached, and 10·8 months, 7·2–not reached, respectively). Loss of the Thr790Met mutation but presence of EGFR-activating mutations in plasma were associated with the shortest progression-free survival (median 2·6 months, 95% CI 1·3–not reached). In 22 post-progression tumour samples, we found one squamous cell and two small-cell transformations. We detected Thr790Met in nine (50%) of 18 samples, Cys797Ser in two (17%) of 12, cMET amplification in five (50%) of ten, BRAF mutation in one (8%) of 13, and KRAS mutation in one (8%) of 13.
Interpretation
Heterogeneous resistance mechanisms developed in patients receiving osimertinib. Differences in resistance mechanisms might dictate future development strategies for osimertinib in clinical trials.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Combinations of long-acting bronchodilators are recommended to reduce the rate of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. It is unclear whether combining olodaterol, a long-acting beta-agonist, with tiotropium, a long-acting anti-muscarinic, reduces the rate of exacerbations compared with tiotropium alone.
Methods
This 52-week, double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, active-controlled trial randomly assigned (1:1) patients with COPD with a history of exacerbations using a randomised block design to receive tiotropium–olodaterol 5 μg–5 μg or tiotropium 5 μg once daily. Patients using inhaled corticosteroids continued this therapy. Treatment was masked to patients, investigators, and those involved in analysing the data. The primary endpoint was the rate of moderate and severe COPD exacerbations from the first dose of medication until 1 day after last drug administration. The primary analysis included all randomly assigned patients who received any dose of study medication but were not from a site excluded due to on-site protocol violations. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02296138.
Findings
Overall, 9009 patients were screened from 818 centres in 51 countries. We recruited 7880 patients between Jan 22, 2015 and March 7, 2016 (mean age 66·4 years [SD 8·5], 5626 [71%] were men, mean FEV1 percent predicted 44·5% [SD 27·7]): 3939 received tiotropium–olodaterol and 3941 tiotropium. The rate of moderate and severe exacerbations was lower with tiotropium–olodaterol than tiotropium (rate ratio [RR] 0·93, 99% CI 0·85–1·02; p=0·0498), not meeting the targeted 0·01 significance level. The proportion of patients reporting adverse events was similar between treatments.
Interpretation
Combining tiotropium and olodaterol did not reduce exacerbation rate as much as expected compared with tiotropium alone.

Tuberculosis is the number one cause of death from infectious disease globally and drug-resistant forms of the disease are a major risk to global health security. On the occasion of World Tuberculosis Day (March 24, 2018), we provide an up-to-date review of the status of the tuberculosis epidemic, recommended diagnostics, drug treatments and vaccines, progress in delivery of care and prevention, progress in research and development, and actions needed to accelerate progress. This Review is presented in the context of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and WHO's End TB Strategy, which share the aim of ending the global tuberculosis epidemic. In 2016, globally there were an estimated 10·4 million new cases of tuberculosis, and 600 000 new cases with resistance to rifampicin (the most powerful first-line drug). All countries and age groups are affected by tuberculosis, but most cases (90%) in 2016 were in adults, and almost two-thirds were accounted for by seven countries: India, Indonesia, China, Philippines, Pakistan, South Africa, and Nigeria. The sex ratio (male to female) was 1·9 and 10% of patients with newly diagnosed tuberculosis were also HIV-positive. There were 1·7 million deaths from tuberculosis in 2016, including 0·4 million deaths among people co-infected with HIV (officially classified as deaths caused by HIV/AIDS). Progress in care and prevention means that the global mortality rate (deaths per 100 000 people per year) is decreasing by 3·4% per year and incidence (new cases per 100 000 people per year) is decreasing by 1·9% per year. From 2000 to 2016, the annual global number of tuberculosis deaths decreased by 24% and the mortality rate declined by 37%. Worldwide, an estimated 53 million deaths were averted through successful treatment. Nonetheless, major gaps in care and prevention remain. For example, the 6·3 million new cases of tuberculosis reported globally in 2016 represented only 61% of the estimated incidence; only one in five of the estimated number of people with drug-resistant tuberculosis was enrolled in treatment. Pipelines for new diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines are progressing, but slowly. Actions needed to accelerate progress towards global milestones and targets for reductions in the burden of tuberculosis disease set for 2020, 2025, 2030, and 2035 include closing coverage gaps in testing, reporting of cases, and overall access to health care, especially in countries that account for the largest share of the global gap; multisectoral efforts to reduce prevalence of major risk factors for infection and disease; and increased investment in research and development."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) causes irreversible loss of lung function. People with IPF have increased concentrations of autotaxin in lung tissue and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and exhaled condensate. GLPG1690 (Galapagos, Mechelen, Belgium) is a novel, potent, selective autotaxin inhibitor with good oral exposure. We explored the effects of GLPG1690 in patients with IPF.
Methods
This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2a study done in 17 centres in Italy, Ukraine and the UK. Eligible patients were aged 40 years or older, non-smokers, not taking pirfenidone or nintedanib, and had a centrally confirmed diagnosis of IPF. We used a computer-generated randomisation schedule to assign patients 1:3 to receive placebo or 600 mg oral GLPG1690 once daily for 12 weeks. The primary outcomes were safety (adverse events), tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. Spirometry was assessed as a secondary outcome. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02738801.
Findings
Between March 24, 2016, and May 2, 2017, 72 patients were screened., of whom 49 were ineligible and 23 were enrolled in eight centres (six in Ukraine and two in the UK). Six patients were assigned to receive placebo and 17 to receive GLPG1690. 20 patients completed the study after one in each group discontinued because of adverse events and one in the GLPG1690 group withdrew consent. Four (67%) patients in the placebo group and 11 (65%) in the GLPG1690 group had treatment-emergent adverse events, most of which were mild to moderate. The most frequent events in the GLPG1690 group were infections and infestations (ten events) and respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (eight events) with no apparent differences from the placebo group. Two (12%) patients in the GLPG1690 group had events that were judged to be related to treatment. Serious adverse events were seen in two patients in the placebo group (one had a urinary tract infection, acute kidney injury, and lower respiratory tract infection and the other had atrioventricular block, second degree) and one in the GLPG1690 group (cholangiocarcinoma that resulted in discontinuation of treatment). No patients died. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of GLPG1690 were similar to those previously shown in healthy controls. LPA C18:2 concentrations in plasma were consistently decreased. Mean change from baseline in forced vital capacity at week 12 was 25 mL (95% CI −75 to 124) for GLPG1690 and −70 mL (−208 to 68 mL) for placebo.
Interpretation
Our findings support further development of GLPG1690 as a novel treatment for IPF.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Severe primary graft dysfunction (PGD) of grade 3 (PGD3) is a common serious complication following lung transplantation. We aimed to assess physiological donor lung preservation using the Organ Care System (OCS) Lung device compared with cold static storage.
Methods
In this non-inferiority, randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial (INSPIRE) recipients were aged 18 years or older and were registered as standard criteria primary double lung transplant candidates. Eligible donors were younger than 65 years old with a ratio of partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood to the fraction of inspired oxygen of more than 300 mm Hg. Transplant recipients were randomly assigned (1:1) with permuted blocks, stratified by centre, to receive standard criteria donor lungs preserved in the OCS Lung device (OCS arm) or cold storage at 4°C (control arm). The composite primary effectiveness endpoint was absence of PGD3 within the first 72 h after transplant and 30-day survival in the per-protocol population, with a stringent 4% non-inferiority margin. Superiority was tested upon meeting non-inferiority. The primary safety endpoint was the mean number of lung graft-related serious adverse events within 30 days of transplant. We did analyses in the per-protocol and intention-to-treat populations. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01630434.
Findings
Between Nov 17, 2011, and Nov 24, 2014, we randomly assigned 370 patients, and 320 (86%) underwent transplantation (n=151 OCS and n=169 control); follow-up was completed in Nov 24, 2016. The primary endpoint was met in 112 (79·4%) of 141 patients (95% CI 71·8 to 85·8) in the OCS group compared with 116 (70·3%) of 165 patients (62·7 to 77·2) in the control group (non-inferiority point estimate −9·1%; 95% CI −∞ to −1·0; p=0·0038; and superiority test p=0·068). Patient survival at day 30 post-transplant was 135 (95·7%) of 141 patients (95% CI 91·0–98·4) in the OCS group and 165 patients (100%; 97·8–100·0) in the control group (p=0·0090) and at 12 months was 126 (89·4%) of 141 patients (83·1–93·9) for the OCS group compared with 146 (88·1%) of 165 patients (81·8–92·8) for the control group. Incidence of PGD3 within 72 h was reported in 25 (17·7%) of 141 patients in the OCS group (95% CI 11·8 to 25·1) and 49 (29·7%) of 165 patients in the control group (22·8 to 37·3; superiority test p=0·015). The primary safety endpoint was met (0·23 lung graft-related serious adverse events in the OCS group compared with 0·28 events in the control group [point estimate −0·045%; 95% CI −∞ to 0·047; non-inferiority test p=0·020]). In the intention-to-treat population, causes of death at 30 days and in hospital were lung graft failure or lung infection (n=2 for OCS vs n=7 for control), cardiac causes (n=4 vs n=1), vascular or stroke (n=3 vs n=0), metabolic coma (n=0 vs n=2), and generalised sepsis (n=0 vs n=1).
Interpretation
The INSPIRE trial met its primary effectiveness and safety endpoints. Although no short-term survival benefit was reported, further research is needed to see whether the reduced incidence of PGD3 within 72 h of a transplant might translate into earlier recovery and improved long-term outcomes after lung transplantation.

This year is the 50th anniversary of the first description of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Since then, much has been learned about the pathogenesis of lung injury in ARDS, with an emphasis on the mechanisms of injury to the lung endothelium and the alveolar epithelium. In terms of treatment, major progress has been made in reducing mortality from ARDS with lung-protective ventilation, using a tidal volume of 6 mL per kg of predicted bodyweight and a plateau airway pressure of less than 30 cm H2O. In more severely hypoxaemic patients with ARDS, neuromuscular blockade and prone positioning have further reduced mortality, probably by extending the therapeutic effects of lung protective ventilation. Fluid-conservative therapy has also increased ventilator-free days in patients with ARDS. The lack of success of pharmacological therapies for ARDS, however, presents a continued challenge in the field. In addition to presenting a brief summary of previous experience with clinical trials in ARDS, we focus in this Review on future opportunities to improve clinical trial design to maximise the likelihood of identifying beneficial pharmacological therapies. In view of the heterogeneity in ARDS, both prognostic and predictive enrichment strategies are needed that target therapies toward specific subgroups of patients with ARDS on the basis of both severity and biology. Approaches to reducing heterogeneity in ARDS clinical trials include using physiological, radiographic, and biological criteria to select patients for both phase 2 and 3 trials. Additionally, interest is growing in the design of preventive clinical trials in ARDS and to initiate early treatment of patients with acute lung injury before the need for endotracheal intubation. We also present promising new approaches to treating ARDS, including combination therapies, cell-based therapies, and generic pharmacological compounds with low-risk profiles that are already in routine clinical use for other clinical indications."

Eosinophils are innate immune cells that, under certain conditions, can be recruited to the lungs, where they have an incompletely understood role in health and disease. Eosinophils have been found in the airways, tissues, and circulation of patients with COPD, during both stable disease and exacerbations. Epidemiological studies and post-hoc analyses of clinical trials of corticosteroid treatment for COPD have shown that the blood eosinophil count is associated with the risk of COPD exacerbations, mortality, decline in FEV1, and response to both inhaled and systemic corticosteroids. Further studies are urgently needed to explore the contribution of eosinophils to the mechanism of disease in COPD and to identify their association with levels of clinical risk. In this review, we explore the role of the eosinophil as a biomarker and mediator of disease in COPD."

Background
Benralizumab is a humanised, anti-interleukin 5 receptor α monoclonal antibody that directly and rapidly depletes eosinophils, reduces asthma exacerbations, and improves lung function for patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. The objective of this trial was to assess the safety and efficacy of benralizumab for patients with mild to moderate, persistent asthma.
Methods
In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients aged 18–75 years, weighing at least 40 kg, and with a postbronchodilator reversibility in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of at least 12% at screening, from 52 clinical research centres in six countries. Patients must have been receiving either low- to medium-dosage inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) or low-dosage ICS plus long-acting β2 agonist fixed-combination therapy at screening, had a morning prebronchodilator FEV1 of more than 50% to 90% predicted at screening, and had one or more of the following symptoms within the 7 days before randomisation: a daytime or night-time asthma symptom score of at least 1 for at least 2 days, rescue short-acting β2 agonist use for at least 2 days, or night-time awakenings due to asthma for at least one night. We converted patients' ICS treatments to 180 μg or 200 μg budesonide dry powder inhaler twice daily for the entire duration of the study using the approved dosages in the patients' respective countries and randomly allocated them (1:1; stratified by blood eosinophil count [<300 cells per μL vs ≥300 cells per μL] and region [USA vs the rest of the world]) with an interactive web-based voice response system to receive subcutaneous placebo or benralizumab 30 mg injections every 4 weeks for 12 weeks. All patients and investigators involved in patient treatment or clinical assessment and those assessing outcomes were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was change from baseline prebronchodilator FEV1 at week 12. Efficacy analyses used an intention to treat approach. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02322775.
Findings
Between Feb 2, 2015, and April 24, 2015, we enrolled 351 patients, with 211 (60%) randomly assigned (105 [50%] to placebo and 106 [50%] to benralizumab). Benralizumab resulted in an 80 mL (95% CI 0–150; p=0·04) greater improvement (least-squares mean difference) in prebronchodilator FEV1 after 12 weeks than did placebo (placebo group: 2246 mL [SD 768] at baseline vs 2261 mL [796] at week 12, change from baseline of 0 mL; benralizumab group: 2248 mL [606] vs 2310 mL [670], 70 mL). 44 (42%) patients in the benralizumab group had adverse events compared with 49 (47%) in the placebo group. The most common adverse events for both groups were nasopharyngitis (eight [8%] patients in each group) and upper respiratory tract infections (five [5%] patients in each group). Serious adverse events occurred in two (2%) patients each in the benralizumab (pancytopenia and a suicide attempt, both considered unrelated to treatment) and placebo (cervix carcinoma and colon adenoma) groups.
Interpretation
This study suggests that active and modifiable disease processes might be ongoing in patients with mild to moderate, persistent asthma receiving ICS. Although the lung function improvement observed does not warrant use of benralizumab in this population because it did not reach the minimum clinically important difference of 10%, further studies to assess this finding should be considered.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Delirium in critically ill patients is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Neuroinflammation might be an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of delirium, and since simvastatin has anti-inflammatory properties it might reduce delirium. We aimed to establish whether early treatment with simvastatin would decrease the time that survivors of critical illness spent in delirium or coma.
Methods
We undertook this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in a general adult intensive care unit (ICU) in Watford General Hospital (Watford, UK). We enrolled critically ill patients (≥18 years) needing mechanical ventilation within 72 h of admission. We randomly assigned patients (1:1 ratio) to receive either simvastatin 80 mg or placebo daily for up to a maximum of 28 days, irrespective of coma or delirium status. We assessed delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU). The primary outcome was number of days alive and was assessed as delirium-free and coma-free in the first 14 days after being randomly allocated to receive treatment or placebo. ICU clinical and research staff and patients were masked to treatment. We did intention-to-treat analyses with no extrapolation. This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Registry, number ISRCTN89079989.
Findings
Between Feb 1, 2013, and July 29, 2016, 142 patients were randomly assigned to receive simvastatin (n=71) or placebo (n=71), and were included in the final analysis. The mean number of days alive without delirium and without coma at day 14 did not differ significantly between the two groups (5·7 days [SD 5·1] with simvastatin and 6·1 days [5·2] with placebo; mean difference 0·4 days, 95% CI −1·3 to 2·1; p=0·66). The most common adverse event was an elevated creatine kinase concentration to more than ten times the upper limit of normal (eight [11%] in the simvastatin group vs three [4%] in the placebo group p=0·208). No patient had a serious adverse event related to the study drug.
Interpretation
These results do not support the hypothesis that simvastatin modifies duration of delirium and coma in critically ill patients.

abstract = "Summary
Progressive fibrotic interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are characterised by major reductions in quality of life and survival and have similarities to certain malignancies. However, palliative care expertise is conspicuously inaccessible to many patients with ILD. Unmet patient and caregiver needs include effective pharmacological and psychosocial interventions to improve quality of life throughout the disease course, sensitive advanced care planning, and timely patient-centred end-of-life care. The incorrect perception that palliative care is synonymous with end-of-life care, with no role earlier in the course of ILD, has created a culture of neglect. Interventions that aim to improve life expectancy are often prioritised without rigorous assessment of the individual's health and psychosocial needs, thereby inadvertently reducing quality of life. As in malignant disorders, radical interventions to slow disease progression and palliative measures to improve quality of life should both be prioritised. Efficient patient-centred models of palliative care must be validated, taking into account religious and cultural differences, as well as variability of resources. Effective implementation of palliative care for ILD will require multidisciplinary participation from clinicians, specialist nurses, psychologists, social workers, and, in some countries, non-governmental faith and community-based organisations with access to palliative care expertise."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Antibiotics do not reduce mortality or short-term treatment non-response in patients receiving treatment for acute exacerbations of COPD in an outpatient setting. However, the long-term effects of antibiotics are unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate if the antibiotic doxycycline added to the oral corticosteroid prednisolone prolongs time to next exacerbation in patients with COPD receiving treatment for an exacerbation in the outpatient setting.
Methods
In this randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial, we recruited a cohort of patients with COPD from outpatient clinics of nine teaching hospitals and three primary care centres in the Netherlands. Inclusion criteria were an age of at least 45 years, a smoking history of at least 10 pack-years, mild-to-severe COPD (Global Initiative of Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD] stage 1–3), and at least one exacerbation during the past 3 years. Exclusion criteria were poor mastery of the Dutch language, poor cognitive functioning, known allergy to doxycycline, pregnancy, and a life expectancy of shorter than 1 month. If a participant had an exacerbation, we randomly assigned them (1:1; with permuted blocks of variable sizes [ranging from two to ten]; stratified by GOLD stage 1–2 vs 3) to a 7 day course of oral doxycycline 100 mg daily (200 mg on the first day) or placebo. Exclusion criteria for randomisation were fever, admission to hospital, and current use of antibiotics or use within the previous 3 weeks. Patients in both groups received a 10 day course of 30 mg oral prednisolone daily. Patients, investigators, and those assessing outcomes were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was time to next exacerbation in all randomly allocated patients except for those incorrectly randomly allocated who did not meet the inclusion criteria or met the exclusion criteria. This trial is registered with the Netherlands Trial Register, number NTR2499.
Findings
Between Dec 22, 2010, and Aug 6, 2013, we randomly allocated 305 (34%) patients from the cohort of 887 patients to doxycycline (152 [50%]) or placebo (153 [50%]), excluding four (1%) patients (two [1%] from each group) who were incorrectly randomly allocated from the analysis. 257 (85%) of 301 patients had a next exacerbation (131 [87%] of 150 in the doxycycline group vs 126 [83%] of 151 in the placebo group). Median time to next exacerbation was 148 days (95% CI 95–200) in the doxycycline group compared with 161 days (118–211) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 1·01 [95% CI 0·79–1·31]; p=0·91). We did not note any significant differences between groups in the frequency of adverse events during the first 2 weeks after randomisation (47 [31%] of 150 in the doxycycline group vs 53 [35%] of 151 in the placebo group; p=0·54) or in serious adverse events during the 2 years of follow-up (42 [28%] vs 43 [29%]; p=1).
Interpretation
In patients with mild-to-severe COPD receiving treatment for an exacerbation in an outpatient setting, the antibiotic doxycycline added to the oral corticosteroid prednisolone did not prolong time to next exacerbation compared with prednisolone alone. These findings do not support prescription of antibiotics for COPD exacerbations in an outpatient setting.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Occurrence of severe asthma exacerbations are the cornerstone of the evaluation of asthma management, but severe asthma exacerbations are rare events. Therefore, trials that assess drug efficacy on exacerbations are done late in clinical development programmes. We aimed to establish an endpoint capturing clinically relevant deteriorations (diary events) that, when combined with severe exacerbations, create a composite outcome (CompEx). CompEx needs to strongly mirror results seen with the severe exacerbation-validated outcome, to allow the design of clinical trials of shorter duration and that include fewer patients than trials assessing severe exacerbations.
Methods
Data from 12 asthma trials of 6 months or 12 months duration and, with standardised collection of exacerbations and diary card variables, were used to construct and test CompEx. The study populations had a mean age of 35–53 years, 59–69% were female, and had a mean FEV1 percentage of predicted normal of 63–84%. With data from five trials, we established a series of diary events based on peak expiratory flow (P), reliever use (R), symptoms (S), awakenings (A), and threshold values for change from baseline and slopes to assess trends. For the development phase, we evaluated different variable combinations and deterioration criteria to select the most robust algorithm to define a diary event for the composite outcome. We defined a composite outcome, CompEx, as first occurrence of a diary event or a severe exacerbation. We assessed the performance of CompEx in seven trials by comparing the event frequency, treatment effect (hazard ratio; HR), and the sample size needed for future trials for the CompEx versus episodes of severe exacerbations.
Findings
CompEx (based on PRS) was the algorithm that best fulfilled our two-set criteria. When censored at 3 months, CompEx resulted in 2·8 times more events than severe exacerbations, and while preserving the treatment effect observed on severe exacerbations (CompEx over severe exacerbation average HR 1·01). The increased number of events, together with the sustained treatment effect, resulted in a large net gain in power, with a 67% mean reduction in the number of patients required in a drug trial for severe exacerbations. In six of seven comparisons tested, CompEx reduced the sample size needed by at least 50%. Validation of independent test populations confirmed the ability of CompEx to increase event frequencies, preserve treatment effect, and reduce the number of patients needed.
Interpretation
CompEx is a composite outcome for evaluation of new asthma therapies. CompEx allows design of shorter trials that require fewer patients than studies of severe exacerbations, while preserving the ability to show a treatment effect compared with severe exacerbations.

In the 50 years since acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was first described, substantial progress has been made in identifying the risk factors for and the pathogenic contributors to the syndrome and in characterising the protein expression patterns in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with ARDS. Despite this effort, however, pharmacological options for ARDS remain scarce. Frequently cited reasons for this absence of specific drug therapies include the heterogeneity of patients with ARDS, the potential for a differential response to drugs, and the possibility that the wrong targets have been studied. Advances in applied biomolecular technology and bioinformatics have enabled breakthroughs for other complex traits, such as cardiovascular disease or asthma, particularly when a precision medicine paradigm, wherein a biomarker or gene expression pattern indicates a patient's likelihood of responding to a treatment, has been pursued.

abstract = "Summary
Global tuberculosis incidence has declined marginally over the past decade, and tuberculosis remains out of control in several parts of the world including Africa and Asia. Although tuberculosis control has been effective in some regions of the world, these gains are threatened by the increasing burden of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis. XDR tuberculosis has evolved in several tuberculosis-endemic countries to drug-incurable or programmatically incurable tuberculosis (totally drug-resistant tuberculosis). This poses several challenges similar to those encountered in the pre-chemotherapy era, including the inability to cure tuberculosis, high mortality, and the need for alternative methods to prevent disease transmission. This phenomenon mirrors the worldwide increase in antimicrobial resistance and the emergence of other MDR pathogens, such as malaria, HIV, and Gram-negative bacteria. MDR and XDR tuberculosis are associated with high morbidity and substantial mortality, are a threat to health-care workers, prohibitively expensive to treat, and are therefore a serious public health problem. In this Commission, we examine several aspects of drug-resistant tuberculosis. The traditional view that acquired resistance to antituberculous drugs is driven by poor compliance and programmatic failure is now being questioned, and several lines of evidence suggest that alternative mechanisms—including pharmacokinetic variability, induction of efflux pumps that transport the drug out of cells, and suboptimal drug penetration into tuberculosis lesions—are likely crucial to the pathogenesis of drug-resistant tuberculosis. These factors have implications for the design of new interventions, drug delivery and dosing mechanisms, and public health policy. We discuss epidemiology and transmission dynamics, including new insights into the fundamental biology of transmission, and we review the utility of newer diagnostic tools, including molecular tests and next-generation whole-genome sequencing, and their potential for clinical effectiveness. Relevant research priorities are highlighted, including optimal medical and surgical management, the role of newer and repurposed drugs (including bedaquiline, delamanid, and linezolid), pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations, preventive strategies (such as prophylaxis in MDR and XDR contacts), palliative and patient-orientated care aspects, and medicolegal and ethical issues."

abstract = "Summary
Background
CNS metastases—including brain and leptomeningeal metastases—from epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are associated with poor prognosis. AZD3759 is a novel EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor with high capability to penetrate the blood–brain barrier. We aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of AZD3759 in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC with brain and leptomeningeal metastases.
Methods
This open-label, multicentre, phase 1 study was undertaken at 11 centres and hospitals in Australia, South Korea, Taiwan, and the USA. Eligible patients included those with histologically confirmed, advanced-stage, EGFR-mutant NSCLC. The study was done in two parts, with dose-escalation and dose-expansion phases. In the dose-escalation phase, patients who had progressed after treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor received AZD3759 at 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, or 500 mg twice a day. In the dose-expansion phase, AZD3759 at 200 mg or 300 mg twice a day was administered to patients with either brain or leptomeningeal metastases who had never received an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor and patients with leptomeningeal metastases who had been pretreated with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The primary objective was safety and tolerability, with severity of adverse events assessed with the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02228369.
Findings
Between Nov 18, 2014, and Sept 7, 2016, 67 patients with NSCLC were enrolled into the study, 29 to the dose-escalation phase and 38 to the dose-expansion phase. At data cutoff (Dec 12, 2016), three (10%) patients in the dose-escalation phase and 20 (53%) in the dose-expansion phase were still receiving treatment. Dose-limiting toxic effects occurred in two (67%) of three patients who received 500 mg twice a day in the dose-escalation phase (grade 3 acne [n=1] and intolerable grade 2 mucosal inflammation [n=1]); hence, doses of 200 mg and 300 mg twice a day were selected for further assessment in the dose-expansion phase. Drug-related skin and gastrointestinal disorders of any grade occurred in 35 (92%) and 29 (76%) patients in the dose-expansion phase, respectively, and led to treatment discontinuation in one (4%) patient treated with 200 mg twice a day (grade 3 increase of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) and two (13%) patients given 300 mg twice a day (grade 3 diarrhoea [n=1] and grade 3 skin rash [n=1]). Grade 3 skin and gastrointestinal disorders occurred in four (17%) and two (9%) patients, respectively, at a dose of 200 mg twice a day, and in six (40%) and four (27%) patients, respectively, at a dose of 300 mg twice a day. No grade 4 disorders arose. Other grade 3 disorders included hepatobiliary and renal disorders (three [13%] at 200 mg twice a day), asthenia (one [7%] at 300 mg twice a day), infections and infestations (one [7%] at 300 mg twice a day), and metabolism and nutrition disorders (one [4%] at 200 mg twice a day and one [7%] at 300 mg twice a day).

AZD3759 at a dose of 200 mg twice daily showed a tolerable safety profile in patients with NSCLC and CNS metastases who had either never received a tyrosine kinase inhibitor or who had been pretreated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The good penetration of the blood–brain barrier by AZD3759, and its promising clinical activity, support further assessment of this compound in studies.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Lumacaftor and ivacaftor combination treatment showed efficacy in patients aged 12 years or older with cystic fibrosis homozygous for F508del-cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in placebo-controlled studies and patients aged 6–11 years with cystic fibrosis homozygous for F508del-CFTR in an open-label study. We report efficacy and safety of lumacaftor and ivacaftor in patients with cystic fibrosis aged 6–11 years homozygous for F508del-CFTR.
Methods
In this phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study, patients were enrolled at 54 hospitals and medical centres in nine countries (the USA, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Sweden, and the UK). Eligible patients weighed at least 15 kg, with a confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of 70 or more, and lung clearance index2·5 (LCI2·5) of 7·5 or more at screening (values less than these thresholds were permitted at day 1). All patients were tested for CFTR genotype at screening; eligible patients had to have the F508del-CFTR mutation on both alleles. Exclusion criteria included any comorbidity or laboratory abnormality that might confound the study results or pose additional risk to the patient. Patients were stratified by weight (<25 kg vs ≥25 kg) and ppFEV1 severity (<90 vs ≥90) determined at the screening visit, and randomly assigned 1:1 to treatment using an interactive web response system to receive 200 mg lumacaftor and 250 mg ivacaftor every 12 hours or placebo for 24 weeks. Patients, all site personnel including the investigator and the site monitor, and the study team were blinded, with the exception of site personnel needing this information in the event of medical emergency or pregnancy and patient safety and regulatory affairs personnel to meet serious adverse event reporting requirements. The primary endpoint was the mean absolute change in LCI2·5 from all study visits up to and including week 24. All randomly assigned patients who were exposed to any amount of study drug, with treatment assignment as assigned were included in primary and other efficacy analyses. All patients who were exposed to any amount of study drug, with treatment assignment as treated, were included in the safety analysis. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02514473.
Findings
Between July 23, 2015, and Sept 20, 2016, a total of 206 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive lumacaftor and ivacaftor (n=104) or placebo (n=102). Two randomly assigned patients were never dosed with study drug (one in the placebo arm due to ineligibility arising from a streptococcal throat infection and one in the lumacaftor and ivacaftor arm due to withdrawal based on refusal to provide blood tests) and were not included in the analyses. 103 patients received at least one dose of lumacaftor and ivacaftor and 101 patients received at least one dose of placebo. For the primary endpoint, the average absolute change in LCI2·5 from baseline over all study visits up to and including the week 24 visit, least squares mean difference was −1·09 units (95% CI −1·43 to −0·75, p<0·0001) for lumacaftor and ivacaftor versus placebo. For the key secondary endpoint of sweat chloride concentration, the least squares mean difference versus placebo was −20·8 mmol/L (95% CI −23·4 to −18·2, average absolute change at day 15/week 4; p<0·0001). The least squares mean difference compared with placebo in absolute change in ppFEV1 from all study visits until week 24 was 2·4 (95% CI 0·4–4·4, p=0·0182). 196 (96%) of 204 patients reported adverse events, most of which were mild (87 [43%]) or moderate (98 [48%]). Treatment was discontinued due to adverse events in three (3%) of 103 patients in the lumacaftor and ivacaftor group and two (2%) of 101 patients in the placebo group. Serious adverse events were reported in 13 (13%) of 103 patients in the lumacaftor and ivacaftor group and 11 (11%) of 101 patients in the placebo group.
Interpretation
Treatment with lumacaftor and ivacaftor was associated with statistically significant improvements in lung function, as measured by LCI2·5 and ppFEV1, versus placebo in patients aged 6–11 years with cystic fibrosis homozygous for F508del-CFTR. The overall safety profile was consistent with previous phase 3 studies of lumacaftor and ivacaftor.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is undefined in neonates, despite the long-standing existing formal recognition of ARDS syndrome in later life. We describe the Neonatal ARDS Project: an international, collaborative, multicentre, and multidisciplinary project which aimed to produce an ARDS consensus definition for neonates that is applicable from the perinatal period. The definition was created through discussions between five expert members of the European Society for Paediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care; four experts of the European Society for Paediatric Research; two independent experts from the USA and two from Australia. This Position Paper provides the first consensus definition for neonatal ARDS (called the Montreux definition). We also provide expert consensus that mechanisms causing ARDS in adults and older children—namely complex surfactant dysfunction, lung tissue inflammation, loss of lung volume, increased shunt, and diffuse alveolar damage—are also present in several critical neonatal respiratory disorders."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Influenza causes substantial morbidity and mortality despite available treatments. Anecdotal reports suggest that plasma with high antibody titres to influenza might be of benefit in the treatment of severe influenza.
Methods
In this randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 2 trial, 29 academic medical centres in the USA assessed the safety and efficacy of anti-influenza plasma with haemagglutination inhibition antibody titres of 1:80 or more to the infecting strain. Hospitalised children and adults (including pregnant women) with severe influenza A or B (defined as the presence of hypoxia or tachypnoea) were randomly assigned to receive either two units (or paediatric equivalent) of anti-influenza plasma plus standard care, versus standard care alone, and were followed up for 28 days. The primary endpoint was time to normalisation of patients' respiratory status (respiratory rate of ≤20 breaths per min for adults or age-defined thresholds of 20–38 breaths per min for children) and a room air oxygen saturation of 93% or more. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01052480.
Findings
Between Jan 13, 2011, and March 2, 2015, 113 participants were screened for eligibility and 98 were randomly assigned from 20 out of 29 participating sites. Of the participants with confirmed influenza (by PCR), 28 (67%) of 42 in the plasma plus standard care group normalised their respiratory status by day 28 compared with 24 (53%) of 45 participants on standard care alone (p=0·069). The hazard ratio (HR) comparing plasma plus standard care with standard care alone was 1·71 (95% CI 0·96–3·06). Six participants died, one (2%) from the plasma plus standard care group and five (10%) from the standard care group (HR 0·19 [95% CI 0·02–1·65], p=0·093). Participants in the plasma plus standard care group had non-significant reductions in days in hospital (median 6 days [IQR 4–16] vs 11 days [5–25], p=0·13) and days on mechanical ventilation (median 0 days [IQR 0–6] vs 3 days [0–14], p=0·14). Fewer plasma plus standard care participants had serious adverse events compared with standard care alone recipients (nine [20%] of 46 vs 20 [38%] of 52, p=0·041), the most frequent of which were acute respiratory distress syndrome (one [2%] vs two [4%] patients) and stroke (one [2%] vs two [4%] patients).
Interpretation
Although there was no significant effect of plasma treatment on the primary endpoint, the treatment seemed safe and well tolerated. A phase 3 randomised trial is now underway to further assess this intervention.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive lung disease with high mortality, uncertain cause, and few treatment options. Studies have identified a significant genetic risk associated with the development of IPF; however, mechanisms by which genetic risk factors promote IPF remain unclear. We aimed to identify genetic variants associated with IPF susceptibility and provide mechanistic insight using gene and protein expression analyses.
Methods
We used a two-stage approach: a genome-wide association study in patients with IPF of European ancestry recruited from nine different centres in the UK and controls selected from UK Biobank (stage 1) matched for age, sex, and smoking status; and a follow-up of associated genetic variants in independent datasets of patients with IPF and controls from two independent US samples from the Chicago consortium and the Colorado consortium (stage 2). We investigated the effect of novel signals on gene expression in large transcriptomic and genomic data resources, and examined expression using lung tissue samples from patients with IPF and controls.
Findings
602 patients with IPF and 3366 controls were selected for stage 1. For stage 2, 2158 patients with IPF and 5195 controls were selected. We identified a novel genome-wide significant signal of association with IPF susceptibility near A-kinase anchoring protein 13 (AKAP13; rs62025270, odds ratio [OR] 1·27 [95% CI 1·18–1·37], p=1·32 × 10−9) and confirmed previously reported signals, including in mucin 5B (MUC5B; rs35705950, OR 2·89 [2·56–3·26], p=1·12 × 10−66) and desmoplakin (DSP; rs2076295, OR 1·44 [1·35–1·54], p=7·81 × 10−28). For rs62025270, the allele A associated with increased susceptibility to IPF was also associated with increased expression of AKAP13 mRNA in lung tissue from patients who had lung resection procedures (n=1111). We showed that AKAP13 is expressed in the alveolar epithelium and lymphoid follicles from patients with IPF, and AKAP13 mRNA expression was 1·42-times higher in lung tissue from patients with IPF (n=46) than that in lung tissue from controls (n=51).
Interpretation
AKAP13 is a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor regulating activation of RhoA, which is known to be involved in profibrotic signalling pathways. The identification of AKAP13 as a susceptibility gene for IPF increases the prospect of successfully targeting RhoA pathway inhibitors in patients with IPF.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Host responses during sepsis are highly heterogeneous, which hampers the identification of patients at high risk of mortality and their selection for targeted therapies. In this study, we aimed to identify biologically relevant molecular endotypes in patients with sepsis.
Methods
This was a prospective observational cohort study that included consecutive patients admitted for sepsis to two intensive care units (ICUs) in the Netherlands between Jan 1, 2011, and July 20, 2012 (discovery and first validation cohorts) and patients admitted with sepsis due to community-acquired pneumonia to 29 ICUs in the UK (second validation cohort). We generated genome-wide blood gene expression profiles from admission samples and analysed them by unsupervised consensus clustering and machine learning. The primary objective of this study was to establish endotypes for patients with sepsis, and assess the association of these endotypes with clinical traits and survival outcomes. We also established candidate biomarkers for the endotypes to allow identification of patient endotypes in clinical practice.
Findings
The discovery cohort had 306 patients, the first validation cohort had 216, and the second validation cohort had 265 patients. Four molecular endotypes for sepsis, designated Mars1–4, were identified in the discovery cohort, and were associated with 28-day mortality (log-rank p=0·022). In the discovery cohort, the worst outcome was found for patients classified as having a Mars1 endotype, and at 28 days, 35 (39%) of 90 people with a Mars1 endotype had died (hazard ratio [HR] vs all other endotypes 1·86 [95% CI 1·21–2·86]; p=0·0045), compared with 23 (22%) of 105 people with a Mars2 endotype (HR 0·64 [0·40–1·04]; p=0·061), 16 (23%) of 71 people with a Mars3 endotype (HR 0·71 [0·41–1·22]; p=0·19), and 13 (33%) of 40 patients with a Mars4 endotype (HR 1·13 [0·63–2·04]; p=0·69). Analysis of the net reclassification improvement using a combined clinical and endotype model significantly improved risk prediction to 0·33 (0·09–0·58; p=0·008). A 140-gene expression signature reliably stratified patients with sepsis to the four endotypes in both the first and second validation cohorts. Only Mars1 was consistently significantly associated with 28-day mortality across the cohorts. To facilitate possible clinical use, a biomarker was derived for each endotype; BPGM and TAP2 reliably identified patients with a Mars1 endotype.
Interpretation
This study provides a method for the molecular classification of patients with sepsis to four different endotypes upon ICU admission. Detection of sepsis endotypes might assist in providing personalised patient management and in selection for trials.

Background
Idiopathic and heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension form a rare but molecularly heterogeneous disease group. We aimed to measure and validate differences in plasma concentrations of proteins that are associated with survival in patients with idiopathic or heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension to improve risk stratification.
Methods
In this observational cohort study, we enrolled patients with idiopathic or heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension from London (UK; cohorts 1 and 2), Giessen (Germany; cohort 3), and Paris (France; cohort 4). Blood samples were collected at routine clinical appointment visits, clinical data were collected within 30 days of blood sampling, and biochemical data were collected within 7 days of blood sampling. We used an aptamer-based assay of 1129 plasma proteins, and patient clinical details were concealed to the technicians. We identified a panel of prognostic proteins, confirmed with alternative targeted assays, which we evaluated against the established prognostic risk equation for pulmonary arterial hypertension derived from the REVEAL registry. All-cause mortality was the primary endpoint.
Findings
20 proteins differentiated survivors and non-survivors in 143 consecutive patients with idiopathic or heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension with 2 years' follow-up (cohort 1) and in a further 75 patients with 2·5 years' follow-up (cohort 2). Nine proteins were both prognostic independent of plasma NT-proBNP concentrations and confirmed by targeted assays. The functions of these proteins relate to myocardial stress, inflammation, pulmonary vascular cellular dysfunction and structural dysregulation, iron status, and coagulation. A cutoff-based score using the panel of nine proteins provided prognostic information independent of the REVEAL equation, improving the C statistic from area under the curve 0·83 (for REVEAL risk score, 95% CI 0·77–0·89; p<0·0001) to 0·91 (for panel and REVEAL 0·87–0·96; p<0·0001) and improving reclassification indices without detriment to calibration. Poor survival was preceded by an adverse change in panel score in paired samples from 43 incident patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension in cohort 3 (p=0·0133). The protein panel was validated in 93 patients with idiopathic or heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension in cohort 4, with 4·4 years' follow-up and improved risk estimates, providing complementary information to the clinical risk equation.
Interpretation
A combination of nine circulating proteins identifies patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension with a high risk of mortality, independent of existing clinical assessments, and might have a use in clinical management and the evaluation of new therapies.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are common diseases with a heterogeneous distribution worldwide. Here, we present methods and disease and risk estimates for COPD and asthma from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) 2015 study. The GBD study provides annual updates on estimates of deaths, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), a summary measure of fatal and non-fatal disease outcomes, for over 300 diseases and injuries, for 188 countries from 1990 to the most recent year.
Methods
We estimated numbers of deaths due to COPD and asthma using the GBD Cause of Death Ensemble modelling (CODEm) tool. First, we analysed data from vital registration and verbal autopsy for the aggregate category of all chronic respiratory diseases. Subsequently, models were run for asthma and COPD relying on covariates to predict rates in countries that have incomplete or no vital registration data. Disease estimates for COPD and asthma were based on systematic reviews of published papers, unpublished reports, surveys, and health service encounter data from the USA. We used the Global Initiative of Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease spirometry-based definition as the reference for COPD and a reported diagnosis of asthma with current wheeze as the definition of asthma. We used a Bayesian meta-regression tool, DisMod-MR 2.1, to derive estimates of prevalence and incidence. We estimated population-attributable fractions for risk factors for COPD and asthma from exposure data, relative risks, and a theoretical minimum exposure level. Results were stratified by Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite measure of income per capita, mean years of education over the age of 15 years, and total fertility rate.
Findings
In 2015, 3·2 million people (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3·1 million to 3·3 million) died from COPD worldwide, an increase of 11·6% (95% UI 5·3 to 19·8) compared with 1990. There was a decrease in age-standardised death rate of 41·9% (37·7 to 45·1) but this was counteracted by population growth and ageing of the global population. From 1990 to 2015, the prevalence of COPD increased by 44·2% (41·7 to 46·6), whereas age-standardised prevalence decreased by 14·7% (13·5 to 15·9). In 2015, 0·40 million people (0·36 million to 0·44 million) died from asthma, a decrease of 26·7% (−7·2 to 43·7) from 1990, and the age-standardised death rate decreased by 58·8% (39·0 to 69·0). The prevalence of asthma increased by 12·6% (9·0 to 16·4), whereas the age-standardised prevalence decreased by 17·7% (15·1 to 19·9). Age-standardised DALY rates due to COPD increased until the middle range of the SDI before reducing sharply. Age-standardised DALY rates due to asthma in both sexes decreased monotonically with rising SDI. The relation between with SDI and DALY rates due to asthma was attributed to variation in years of life lost (YLLs), whereas DALY rates due to COPD varied similarly for YLLs and years lived with disability across the SDI continuum. Smoking and ambient particulate matter were the main risk factors for COPD followed by household air pollution, occupational particulates, ozone, and secondhand smoke. Together, these risks explained 73·3% (95% UI 65·8 to 80·1) of DALYs due to COPD. Smoking and occupational asthmagens were the only risks quantified for asthma in GBD, accounting for 16·5% (14·6 to 18·7) of DALYs due to asthma.
Interpretation
Asthma was the most prevalent chronic respiratory disease worldwide in 2015, with twice the number of cases of COPD. Deaths from COPD were eight times more common than deaths from asthma. In 2015, COPD caused 2·6% of global DALYs and asthma 1·1% of global DALYs. Although there are laudable international collaborative efforts to make surveys of asthma and COPD more comparable, no consensus exists on case definitions and how to measure disease severity for population health measurements like GBD. Comparisons between countries and over time are important, as much of the chronic respiratory burden is either preventable or treatable with affordable interventions.

abstract = "Summary
Background
COPD can be diagnosed early using spirometry, but spirometry use is only recommended in symptomatic smokers, even though early stages of COPD can be asymptomatic. We investigated the prognosis of individuals with asymptomatic and symptomatic, undiagnosed COPD in the general population in Denmark.
Methods
In this prospective cohort study, we analysed data from 95 288 individuals aged 20–100 years from the Copenhagen General Population Study. 32 518 (34%) of these individuals were regarded as being at high risk for COPD (defined as individuals aged 40 years or older, with cumulative tobacco consumption of ten pack-years or higher, and without self-reported or a previous hospital contact for asthma). COPD was defined as FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) of less than 70% and less than the lower limit of normal, and FEV1 of less than 80% of the predicted normal value. Individuals were considered undiagnosed if neither a previous COPD hospital contact, nor medical treatment for COPD, was registered. We obtained information on exacerbations and pneumonia from the National Danish Patient Registry and vital status from the National Danish Civil Registration System, and cause of death from the National Danish Causes of Death Registry. We used Cox proportional hazard models to assess risk of exacerbations, pneumonia, deaths due to respiratory causes, and deaths from all causes from 2003 to 2014.
Findings
Between Nov 26, 2003, and July 10, 2013, 95 288 individuals were screened and 32 518 (34%) were at high risk of having COPD. 3699 (11%) of these participants met the COPD criteria and 2903 (78%) were undiagnosed, of whom 2052 (71%) were symptomatic. During a median follow-up of 6·1 years (IQR 4·9), we recorded 800 exacerbations, 2038 cases of pneumonia, and 2789 deaths in the 32 518 individuals at high risk of having COPD, including 152 deaths due to respiratory disease. Compared with individuals without COPD, the age and sex adjusted hazard ratio (HR) was 5·0 (95% CI 2·8–8·9) for exacerbations, 1·7 (1·3–2·2) for pneumonia, 0·7 (0·2–3·0) for death from respiratory causes, and 1·3 (1·1–1·6) for death from all causes in individuals with undiagnosed, asymptomatic COPD. Corresponding HRs were 15·5 (11·0–21·8) for exacerbations, 2·8 (2·4–3·3) for pneumonia, 4·3 (2·8–6·7) for death from respiratory causes, and 2·0 (1·8–2·3) for death from all causes in individuals with undiagnosed, symptomatic COPD.
Interpretation
Individuals with undiagnosed, symptomatic COPD had an increased risk of exacerbations, pneumonia, and death. Individuals with undiagnosed, asymptomatic COPD had an increased risk of exacerbations and pneumonia. These findings suggest that better initiatives for early diagnosis and treatment of COPD are needed.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The clinical course of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is unpredictable. Clinical prediction tools are not accurate enough to predict disease outcomes.
Methods
We enrolled patients with IPF diagnosis in a six-cohort study at Yale University (New Haven, CT, USA), Imperial College London (London, UK), University of Chicago (Chicago, IL, USA), University of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, PA, USA), University of Freiburg (Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany), and Brigham and Women's Hospital–Harvard Medical School (Boston, MA, USA). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells or whole blood were collected at baseline from 425 participants and from 98 patients (23%) during 4–6 years' follow-up. A 52-gene signature was measured by the nCounter analysis system in four cohorts and extracted from microarray data (GeneChip) in the other two. We used the Scoring Algorithm for Molecular Subphenotypes (SAMS) to classify patients into low-risk or high-risk groups based on the 52-gene signature. We studied mortality with a competing risk model and transplant-free survival with a Cox proportional hazards model. We analysed timecourse data and response to antifibrotic drugs with linear mixed effect models.
Findings
The application of SAMS to the 52-gene signature identified two groups of patients with IPF (low-risk and high-risk), with significant differences in mortality or transplant-free survival in each of the six cohorts (hazard ratio [HR] range 2·03–4·37). Pooled data showed similar results for mortality (HR 2·18, 95% CI 1·53–3·09; p<0·0001) or transplant-free survival (2·04, 1·52–2·74; p<0·0001). Adding 52-gene risk profiles to the Gender, Age, and Physiology index significantly improved its mortality predictive accuracy. Temporal changes in SAMS scores were associated with changes in forced vital capacity (FVC) in two cohorts. Untreated patients did not shift their risk profile over time. A simultaneous increase in up score and decrease in down score was predictive of decreased transplant-free survival (3·18, 1·16–8·76; p=0·025) in the Pittsburgh cohort. A simultaneous decrease in up score and increase in down score after initiation of antifibrotic drugs was associated with a significant (p=0·0050) improvement in FVC in the Yale cohort.
Interpretation
The peripheral blood 52-gene expression signature is predictive of outcome in patients with IPF. The potential value of the 52-gene signature in predicting response to therapy should be determined in prospective studies.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis are at risk of developing pulmonary fibrosis, which is associated with reduced survival. In families with multiple affected members, individuals might be diagnosed as having idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) or chronic (fibrotic) hypersensitivity pneumonitis, which suggests these disorders share risk factors. We aimed to test whether the genomic risk factors associated with the development and progression of IPF are also associated with the development of fibrosis and reduced survival in people with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
Methods
We did an observational study of two independent cohorts of patients with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, one from the University of California San Francisco, CA, USA (UCSF), and one from the University of Texas Southwestern, TX, USA (UTSW). We measured two common single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with IPF (MUC5B rs35705950 and TOLLIP rs5743890) and telomere length in peripheral blood leucocytes, and assessed their associations with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis risk, survival, and clinical, radiographic, and pathological features. We compared findings with those in patients with IPF from the UCSF and UTSW cohorts, and healthy controls from the European population of the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3, version 1.
Findings
The cohorts included 145 patients from UCSF and 72 from UTSW. The minor allele frequency (MAF) was greater for MUC5B rs35705950 in patients with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis than in healthy controls (24·4% in UCSF and 32·3% in UTSW vs 10·7%, both p<0·0001), but not for TOLLIP rs5743890. The MAFs were similar to those for IPF (UCSF 33·3%, p=0·09; UTSW 32·0%, p=0·95). In the combined UCSF and UTSW chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis cohort, we saw associations between extent of radiographic fibrosis and MUC5B rs35705950 minor alleles (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1·91, 95% CI 1·02–3·59, p=0·045) and short telomere length (adjusted OR per unit change in mean natural logarithm-transformed ratio of telomere repeat copy number to single gene copy number 0·23, 0·09–0·59, p=0·002). Telomere length less than the tenth percentile for age was also significantly associated with reduced survival (log-rank p=0·006).
Interpretation
The associations between MUC5B rs35705950 and short telomere length with extent of fibrosis, histopathological features of usual interstitial pneumonia, and reduced survival in patients with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis suggest shared pathobiology with IPF, and might help to stratify risk.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Large randomised controlled trials have shown that early supplemental parenteral nutrition in patients admitted to adult and paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) is harmful. Overdosing of energy with too little protein was suggested as a potential reason for this. This study analysed which macronutrient was associated with harm caused by early supplemental parenteral nutrition in the Paediatric Early versus Late Parenteral Nutrition In Critical Illness (PEPaNIC) randomised trial.
Methods
Patients in the initial randomised controlled trial were randomly assigned to receive suppplemental parenteral nutrition (PN) within 24 h of PICU admission (early PN) or to receive such PN after 1 week (late PN) when enteral nutrition was insufficient. In this post-randomisation, observational study, doses of glucose, lipids, and aminoacids administered during the first 7 days of PICU stay were expressed as % of reference doses from published clinical guidelines for age and weight. Independent associations between average macronutrient doses up to each of the first 7 days and likelihood of acquiring an infection in the PICU, of earlier live weaning from mechanical ventilation, and of earlier live PICU discharge were investigated using multivariable Cox proportional hazard analyses. The three macronutrients were included in the analysis simultaneously and baseline risk factors were adjusted for.
Findings
From June 18, 2012, to July 27, 2015, 7519 children aged between newborn and 17 years were assessed for eligibility. 6079 patients were excluded, and 1440 children were randomly assigned to receive either early PN (n=723) or late PN (n=717). With increasing doses of aminoacids, the likelihood of acquiring a new infection was higher (adjusted hazard ratios [HRs] per 10% increase between 1·043–1·134 for days 1–5, p≤0·029), while the likelihood of earlier live weaning from mechanical ventilation was lower (HRs 0·950–0·975 days 3–7, p≤0·045), and the likelihood of earlier live PICU discharge was lower (HRs 0·943–0·972 days 1–7, p≤0·030). By contrast, more glucose during the first 3 days of PICU stay was independently associated with fewer infections (HRs 0·870–0·913, p≤0·036), whereas more lipids was independently associated with earlier PICU discharge (HRs 1·027–1·050, p≤0·043 days 4–7). Risk of harm with aminoacids was also shown for low doses.
Interpretation
These associations suggest that early administration of aminoacids, but not glucose or lipids, could explain harm caused by early supplemental parenteral nutrition in critically ill children.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The Streptococcus pneumoniae Invasive Disease network (SpIDnet) actively monitors populations in nine sites in seven European countries for invasive pneumococcal disease. Five sites use 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) alone and four use the ten-valent PCV (PCV10) and PCV13. Vaccination uptake is greater than 90% in six sites and 67–78% in three sites. We measured the effects of introducing high-valency PCVs on the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in children younger than 5 years.
Methods
We compared the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in each of the 4 years after the introduction of PCV13 alone or PCV10 and PCV13 with the average incidence during the preceding period of heptavalent PCV (PCV7) use, overall and by serotype category. We calculated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% CIs for each year and pooled the values for all sites in a random effects meta-analysis.
Findings
4 years after the introduction of PCV13 alone or PCV10 and PCV13, the pooled IRR was 0·53 (95% CI 0·43–0·65) for invasive pneumococcal disease in children younger than 5 years caused by any serotype, 0·16 (0·07–0·40) for disease caused by PCV7 serotypes, 0·17 (0·07–0·42) for disease caused by 1, 5, and 7F serotypes, and 0·41 (0·25–0·69) for that caused by 3, 6A and 19A serotypes. We saw a similar pattern when we restricted the analysis to sites where only PCV13 was used. The pooled IRR for invasive pneumococcal disease caused by non-PCV13 serotypes was 1·62 (1·09–2·42).
Interpretation
The incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by all serotypes decreased due to a decline in the incidence of vaccine serotypes. By contrast, that of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by non-PCV13 serotypes increased, which suggests serotype replacement. Long-term surveillance will be crucial to monitor the further effects of PCV10 and PCV13 vaccination programmes in young children.

abstract = "Summary
Although early childhood wheeze is common, persistent asthma is less common. However, of those children who do progress to persistent asthma, lung function abnormalities and airway remodelling can already be seen early in life and can increase in magnitude with time. There has been a general expectation that early use of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) could change the natural history of asthma if started in the young child with wheeze. Despite this expectation, the role of ICS therapy in altering the natural course of disease in children with emerging asthma is not well defined. Here we discuss the potential use of ICS therapy to alter the natural disease course in children at risk of persistent asthma (defined as wheeze and presence of airflow limitation or airway hyper-reactivity, or both). We present new information suggesting a more personalised treatment approach in which children might benefit from daily or intermittent ICS therapy. We also provide an overview of other emerging therapies that might be useful in disease modification for the wheezing young child at risk of persistent asthma."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Respiratory virus infection is a common cause of hospitalisation in adults. Rapid point-of-care testing (POCT) for respiratory viruses might improve clinical care by reducing unnecessary antibiotic use, shortening length of hospital stay, improving influenza detection and treatment, and rationalising isolation facility use; however, insufficient evidence exists to support its use over standard clinical care. We aimed to assess the effect of routine POCT on a broad range of clinical outcomes including antibiotic use.
Methods
In this pragmatic, parallel-group, open-label, randomised controlled trial, we enrolled adults (aged ≥18 years) within 24 h of presenting to the emergency department or acute medical unit of a large UK hospital with acute respiratory illness or fever higher than 37·5°C (≤7 days duration), or both, over two winter seasons. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), via an internet-based allocation sequence with random permuted blocks, to have a molecular POC test for respiratory viruses or routine clinical care. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who received antibiotics while hospitalised (up to 30 days). Secondary outcomes included duration of antibiotics, proportion of patients receiving single doses or brief courses of antibiotics, length of stay, antiviral use, isolation facility use, and safety. Analysis was by modified intention to treat, excluding patients who declined intervention or were withdrawn for protocol violations. This study is registered with ISRCTN, number 90211642, and has been completed.
Findings
Between Jan 15, 2015, and April 30, 2015, and between Oct 1, 2015, and April 30, 2016, we enrolled 720 patients (362 assigned to POCT and 358 to routine care). Six patients withdrew or had protocol violations. 301 (84%) of 360 patients in the POCT group received antibiotics compared with 294 (83%) of 354 controls (difference 0·6%, 95% CI −4·9 to 6·0; p=0·84). Mean duration of antibiotics did not differ between groups (7·2 days [SD 5·1] in the POCT group vs 7·7 days [4·9] in the control group; difference −0·4, 95% CI −1·2 to 0·4; p=0·32). 50 (17%) of 301 patients treated with antibiotics in the POCT group received single doses or brief courses of antibiotics (<48 h) compared with 26 (9%) of 294 patients in the control group (difference 7·8%, 95% CI 2·5 to 13·1; p=0·0047; number needed to test=13). Mean length of stay was shorter in the POCT group (5·7 days [SD 6·3]) than in the control group (6·8 days [7·7]; difference −1·1, 95% CI −2·2 to −0·3; p=0·0443). Appropriate antiviral treatment of influenza-positive patients was more common in the POCT group (52 [91%] of 57 patients) than in the control group (24 [65%] of 37 patients; difference 26·4%, 95% CI 9·6 to 43·2; p=0·0026; number needed to test=4). We found no differences in adverse outcomes between the groups (77 [21%] of 360 patients in the POCT group vs 88 [25%] of 354 patients in the control group; −3·5%, −9·7 to 2·7; p=0·29).
Interpretation
Routine use of molecular POCT for respiratory viruses did not reduce the proportion of patients treated with antibiotics. However, the primary outcome measure failed to capture differences in antibiotic use because many patients were started on antibiotics before the results of POCT could be made available. Although POCT was not associated with a reduction in the duration of antibiotics overall, more patients in the POCT group received single doses or brief courses of antibiotics than did patients in the control group. POCT was also associated with a reduced length of stay and improved influenza detection and antiviral use, and appeared to be safe.

Background
Little is known about the incidence of severe critical events in children undergoing general anaesthesia in Europe. We aimed to identify the incidence, nature, and outcome of severe critical events in children undergoing anaesthesia, and the associated potential risk factors.
Methods
The APRICOT study was a prospective observational multicentre cohort study of children from birth to 15 years of age undergoing elective or urgent anaesthesia for diagnostic or surgical procedures. Children were eligible for inclusion during a 2-week period determined prospectively by each centre. There were 261 participating centres across 33 European countries. The primary endpoint was the occurence of perioperative severe critical events requiring immediate intervention. A severe critical event was defined as the occurrence of respiratory, cardiac, allergic, or neurological complications requiring immediate intervention and that led (or could have led) to major disability or death. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01878760.
Findings
Between April 1, 2014, and Jan 31, 2015, 31 127 anaesthetic procedures in 30 874 children with a mean age of 6·35 years (SD 4·50) were included. The incidence of perioperative severe critical events was 5·2% (95% CI 5·0–5·5) with an incidence of respiratory critical events of 3·1% (2·9–3·3). Cardiovascular instability occurred in 1·9% (1·7–2·1), with an immediate poor outcome in 5·4% (3·7–7·5) of these cases. The all-cause 30-day in-hospital mortality rate was 10 in 10 000. This was independent of type of anaesthesia. Age (relative risk 0·88, 95% CI 0·86–0·90; p<0·0001), medical history, and physical condition (1·60, 1·40–1·82; p<0·0001) were the major risk factors for a serious critical event. Multivariate analysis revealed evidence for the beneficial effect of years of experience of the most senior anaesthesia team member (0·99, 0·981–0·997; p<0·0048 for respiratory critical events, and 0·98, 0·97–0·99; p=0·0039 for cardiovascular critical events), rather than the type of health institution or providers.
Interpretation
This study highlights a relatively high rate of severe critical events during the anaesthesia management of children for surgical or diagnostic procedures in Europe, and a large variability in the practice of paediatric anaesthesia. These findings are substantial enough to warrant attention from national, regional, and specialist societies to target education of anaesthesiologists and their teams and implement strategies for quality improvement in paediatric anaesthesia.

abstract = "Summary
Background
A previous aggregate data meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials showed that vitamin D supplementation reduces the rate of asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids. Whether this effect is restricted to patients with low baseline vitamin D status is unknown.
Methods
For this systematic review and one-step and two-step meta-analysis of individual participant data, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science for double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised controlled trials of vitamin D3 or vitamin D2 supplementation in people with asthma that reported incidence of asthma exacerbation, published between database inception and Oct 26, 2016. We analysed individual participant data requested from the principal investigator for each eligible trial, adjusting for age and sex, and clustering by study. The primary outcome was the incidence of asthma exacerbation requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids. Mixed-effects regression models were used to obtain the pooled intervention effect with a 95% CI. Subgroup analyses were done to determine whether effects of vitamin D on risk of asthma exacerbation varied according to baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentration, age, ethnic or racial origin, body-mass index, vitamin D dosing regimen, use of inhaled corticosteroids, or end-study 25(OH)D levels; post-hoc subgroup analyses were done according to sex and study duration. This study was registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42014013953.
Findings
Our search identified 483 unique studies, eight of which were eligible randomised controlled trials (total 1078 participants). We sought individual participant data for each and obtained it for seven studies (955 participants). Vitamin D supplementation reduced the rate of asthma exacerbation requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids among all participants (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] 0·74, 95% CI 0·56–0·97; p=0·03; 955 participants in seven studies; high-quality evidence). There were no significant differences between vitamin D and placebo in the proportion of participants with at least one exacerbation or time to first exacerbation. Subgroup analyses of the rate of asthma exacerbations treated with systemic corticosteroids revealed that protective effects were seen in participants with baseline 25(OH)D of less than 25 nmol/L (aIRR 0·33, 0·11–0·98; p=0·046; 92 participants in three studies; moderate-quality evidence) but not in participants with higher baseline 25(OH)D levels (aIRR 0·77, 0·58–1·03; p=0·08; 764 participants in six studies; moderate-quality evidence; pinteraction=0·25). p values for interaction for all other subgroup analyses were also higher than 0·05; therefore, we did not show that the effects of this intervention are stronger in any one subgroup than in another. Six studies were assessed as being at low risk of bias, and one was assessed as being at unclear risk of bias. The two-step meta-analysis did not reveal evidence of heterogeneity of effect (I2=0·0, p=0·56).
Interpretation
Vitamin D supplementation reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids overall. We did not find definitive evidence that effects of this intervention differed across subgroups of patients.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Data from in-vitro, animal, and human lung injury models suggest that keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) might be beneficial in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The objective of this trial was to investigate the effect of KGF in patients with ARDS.
Methods
We did a double-blind, allocation concealed, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial in two intensive care units in the UK, involving patients fulfilling the American-European Consensus Conference Definition of ARDS. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by computer-generated randomisation schedule with variable block size stratified by site and presence of severe sepsis requiring vasopressors to receive either recombinant human KGF (palifermin 60 μg/kg) or placebo (0·9% sodium chloride solution) daily for a maximum of 6 days. Both patients and investigators were masked to treatment. The primary endpoint was oxygenation index (OI) at day 7. Analyses were by intention to treat. The trial is registered with International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Registry, number ISRCTN95690673.
Findings
Between Feb 23, 2011, and Feb 26, 2014, 368 patients were assessed for eligibility for inclusion in the trial. Of the 60 patients recruited, 29 patients were randomly assigned to receive KGF and 31 to placebo; all were included in the analysis of the primary outcome. There was no significant difference between the two groups in OI at day 7 (mean 62·3 [SD 57·8] in the KGF group, 43·1 [33·5] in the placebo group; mean difference 19·2, 95% CI −5·6 to 44·0, p=0·13). Of interest, although not defined as outcome measures a priori, the KGF group, compared with placebo, had fewer median ventilator-free days (1 day [IQR 0 to 17] in the KGF group vs 20 days [13–22] in the placebo group; difference −8 days, 95% CI −17 to −2; p=0·0002), a longer median duration of ventilation in survivors to day 90 (16 days [IQR 13–30] in the KGF group vs 11 days [8–16] in the placebo group; difference 6 days, 95% CI 2 to 14; p=0·002), and a higher mortality at 28 days (nine [31%] vs three [10%] deaths; risk ratio 3·2, 95% CI 1·0 to 10·7, p=0·054). Adverse events were more frequent in the KGF group than the placebo group (14 vs 5 events; odds ratio 4·9, 95% CI 1·3 to 20·3, p=0·008). The two adverse events assessed as related to KGF were due to pyrexia.
Interpretation
KGF did not improve physiological or clinical outcomes in ARDS and might be harmful to patient health.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib improves the outcomes of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) harbouring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. The coexistence of the T790M resistance mutation with another EGFR mutation in treatment-naive patients has been associated with a shorter progression-free survival to EGFR inhibition than in the absence of the T790M mutation. To test this hypothesis clinically, we developed a proof-of-concept study, in which patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC were treated with the combination of erlotinib and bevacizumab, stratified by the presence of the pretreatment T790M mutation.
Methods
BELIEF was an international, multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 trial done at 29 centres in eight European countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had treatment-naive, pathologically confirmed stage IIIB or stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with a confirmed, activating EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation). Patients received oral erlotinib 150 mg per day and intravenous bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every 21 days and were tested centrally for the pretreatment T790M resistance mutation with a peptide nucleic acid probe-based real-time PCR. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. The primary efficacy analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population and was stratified into two parallel substudies according to the centrally confirmed pretreatment T790M mutation status of enrolled patients (T790M positive or negative). The safety analysis was done in all patients that have received at least one dose of trial treatment. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01562028.
Findings
Between June 11, 2012, and Oct 28, 2014, 109 patients were enrolled and included in the efficacy analysis. 37 patients were T790M mutation positive and 72 negative. The overall median progression-free survival was 13·2 months (95% CI 10·3–15·5), with a 12 month progression-free survival of 55% (95% CI 45–64). The primary endpoint was met only in substudy one (T790M-positive patients). In the T790M-positive group, median progression-free survival was 16·0 months (12·7 to not estimable), with a 12 month progression-free survival of 68% (50–81), whereas in the T790M-negative group, median progression-free survival was 10·5 months (9·4–14·2), with a 12 month progression-free survival of 48% (36–59). Of 106 patients included in the safety analysis, five had grade 4 adverse events (one acute coronary syndrome, one biliary tract infection, one other neoplasms, and two colonic perforations) and one died due to sepsis.
Interpretation
The BELIEF trial provides further evidence of benefit for the combined use of erlotinib and bevacizumab in patients with NSCLC harbouring activating EGFR mutations.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Little information is available about the geo-economic variations in demographics, management, and outcomes of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We aimed to characterise the effect of these geo-economic variations in patients enrolled in the Large Observational Study to Understand the Global Impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Failure (LUNG SAFE).
Methods
LUNG SAFE was done during 4 consecutive weeks in winter, 2014, in a convenience sample of 459 intensive-care units in 50 countries across six continents. Inclusion criteria were admission to a participating intensive-care unit (including transfers) within the enrolment window and receipt of invasive or non-invasive ventilation. One of the trial's secondary aims was to characterise variations in the demographics, management, and outcome of patients with ARDS. We used the 2016 World Bank countries classification to define three major geo-economic groupings, namely European high-income countries (Europe-High), high-income countries in the rest of the world (rWORLD-High), and middle-income countries (Middle). We compared patient outcomes across these three groupings. LUNG SAFE is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02010073.
Findings
Of the 2813 patients enrolled in LUNG SAFE who fulfilled ARDS criteria on day 1 or 2, 1521 (54%) were recruited from Europe-High, 746 (27%) from rWORLD-High, and 546 (19%) from Middle countries. We noted significant geographical variations in demographics, risk factors for ARDS, and comorbid diseases. The proportion of patients with severe ARDS or with ratios of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to the fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired air (FiO2) less than 150 was significantly lower in rWORLD-High countries than in the two other regions. Use of prone positioning and neuromuscular blockade was significantly more common in Europe-High countries than in the other two regions. Adjusted duration of invasive mechanical ventilation and length of stay in the intensive-care unit were significantly shorter in patients in rWORLD-High countries than in Europe-High or Middle countries. High gross national income per person was associated with increased survival in ARDS; hospital survival was significantly lower in Middle countries than in Europe-High or rWORLD-High countries.
Interpretation
Important geo-economic differences exist in the severity, clinician recognition, and management of ARDS, and in patients' outcomes. Income per person and outcomes in ARDS are independently associated.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Cough can be a debilitating symptom of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and is difficult to treat. PA101 is a novel formulation of sodium cromoglicate delivered via a high-efficiency eFlow nebuliser that achieves significantly higher drug deposition in the lung compared with the existing formulations. We aimed to test the efficacy and safety of inhaled PA101 in patients with IPF and chronic cough and, to explore the antitussive mechanism of PA101, patients with chronic idiopathic cough (CIC) were also studied.
Methods
This pilot, proof-of-concept study consisted of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with IPF and chronic cough and a parallel study of similar design in patients with CIC. Participants with IPF and chronic cough recruited from seven centres in the UK and the Netherlands were randomly assigned (1:1, using a computer-generated randomisation schedule) by site staff to receive PA101 (40 mg) or matching placebo three times a day via oral inhalation for 2 weeks, followed by a 2 week washout, and then crossed over to the other arm. Study participants, investigators, study staff, and the sponsor were masked to group assignment until all participants had completed the study. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in objective daytime cough frequency (from 24 h acoustic recording, Leicester Cough Monitor). The primary efficacy analysis included all participants who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-baseline efficacy measurement. Safety analysis included all those who took at least one dose of study drug. In the second cohort, participants with CIC were randomly assigned in a study across four centres with similar design and endpoints. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02412020) and the EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT Number 2014-004025-40) and both cohorts are closed to new participants.
Findings
Between Feb 13, 2015, and Feb 2, 2016, 24 participants with IPF were randomly assigned to treatment groups. 28 participants with CIC were enrolled during the same period and 27 received study treatment. In patients with IPF, PA101 reduced daytime cough frequency by 31·1% at day 14 compared with placebo; daytime cough frequency decreased from a mean 55 (SD 55) coughs per h at baseline to 39 (29) coughs per h at day 14 following treatment with PA101, versus 51 (37) coughs per h at baseline to 52 (40) cough per h following placebo treatment (ratio of least-squares [LS] means 0·67, 95% CI 0·48–0·94, p=0·0241). By contrast, no treatment benefit for PA101 was observed in the CIC cohort; mean reduction of daytime cough frequency at day 14 for PA101 adjusted for placebo was 6·2% (ratio of LS means 1·27, 0·78–2·06, p=0·31). PA101 was well tolerated in both cohorts. The incidence of adverse events was similar between PA101 and placebo treatments, most adverse events were mild in severity, and no severe adverse events or serious adverse events were reported.
Interpretation
This study suggests that the mechanism of cough in IPF might be disease specific. Inhaled PA101 could be a treatment option for chronic cough in patients with IPF and warrants further investigation.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Avoidance of excessive sedation and subsequent prolonged mechanical ventilation in intensive care units (ICUs) is recommended, but no data are available for critically ill postoperative patients. We hypothesised that in such patients stopping sedation immediately after admission to the ICU could reduce unnecessary sedation and improve patient outcomes.
Methods
We did a randomised, parallel-group, clinical trial at three ICUs in France. Stratified randomisation with minimisation (1:1 via a restricted web platform) was used to assign eligible patients (aged ≥18 years, admitted to an ICU after abdominal surgery, and expected to require at least 12 h of mechanical ventilation because of a critical illness defined by a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score >1 for any organ, but without severe acute respiratory distress syndrome or brain injury) to usual sedation care provided according to recommended practices (control group) or to immediate interruption of sedation (intervention group). The primary outcome was the time to successful extubation (defined as the time from randomisation to the time of extubation [or tracheotomy mask] for at least 48 h). All patients who underwent randomisation (except for those who were excluded after randomisation) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01486121.
Findings
Between Dec 2, 2011, and Feb 27, 2014, 137 patients were randomly assigned to the control (n=68) or intervention groups (n=69). In the intention-to-treat analysis, time to successful extubation was significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (median 8 h [IQR 4–36] vs 50 h [29–93], group difference −33·6 h [95% CI −44·9 to −22·4]; p<0·0001). The adjusted hazard ratio was 5·2 (95% CI 3·1–8·8, p<0·0001).
Interpretation
Immediate interruption of sedation in critically ill postoperative patients with organ dysfunction who were admitted to the ICU after abdominal surgery improved outcomes compared with usual sedation care. These findings support interruption of sedation in these patients following transfer from the operating room.

Background
Present treatment strategies to stratify exacerbation risk in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) rely on a history of two or more events in the previous year. We aimed to understand year to year variability in exacerbations and factors associated with consistent exacerbations over time.
Methods
In this longitudinal, prospective analysis of exacerbations in the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS) cohort, we analysed patients aged 40–80 years with COPD for whom 3 years of prospective data were available, identified through various means including care at academic and non-academic medical centres, word of mouth, and existing patient registries. Participants were enrolled in the study between Nov 12, 2010, and July 31, 2015. We classified patients according to yearly exacerbation frequency: no exacerbations in any year; one exacerbation in every year during 3 years of follow-up; and those with inconsistent exacerbations (individuals who had both years with exacerbations and years without during the 3 years of follow-up). Participants were characterised by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) spirometric category (1–4) on the basis of post-bronchodilator FEV1. Stepwise logistic regression was used to compare factors associated with one or more acute exacerbations of COPD every year for 3 years versus no exacerbations in the same timeframe. Additionally, a stepwise zero-inflated negative binomial model was used to assess predictors of exacerbation count during follow-up in all patients with available data. Baseline symptom burden was assessed with the COPD assessment test. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01969344.
Findings
2981 patients were enrolled during the study. 1843 patients had COPD, of which 1105 patients had 3 years of complete, prospective follow-up data. 538 (49%) of 1105 patients had at least one acute exacerbation during the 3 years of follow-up, whereas 567 (51%) had none. 82 (7%) of 1105 patients had at least one acute exacerbation each year, whereas only 23 (2%) had two or more acute exacerbations in each year. An inconsistent pattern (both years with and without acute exacerbations) was common (456 [41%] of the group), particularly among GOLD stages 3 and 4 patients (256 [56%] of 456). In logistic regression, consistent acute exacerbations (≥1 event per year for 3 years) were associated with higher baseline symptom burden, previous exacerbations, greater evidence of small airway abnormality on CT, lower interleukin-15 concentrations, and higher interleukin-8 concentrations, than were no acute exacerbations.
Interpretation
Although acute exacerbations are common, the exacerbation status of most individuals varies markedly from year to year. Among patients who had any acute exacerbation over 3 years, very few repeatedly had two or more events per year. In addition to symptoms and history of exacerbations in the year before study enrolment, we identified several novel biomarkers associated with consistent exacerbations, including CT-defined small airway abnormality, and interleukin-15 and interleukin-8 concentrations.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of viral acute lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) in young children, and a major cause of hospital admissions and health-care utilisation globally. Substantial efforts have been made to develop RSV vaccines and vaccine-like monoclonal antibodies to prevent acute RSV LRTI. Prevention of acute disease could improve long-term lung health, with potential effects on wheezing, asthma, and chronic lung disease. This Personal View describes assessments that should be initiated during clinical trials and continued after licensure to fully evaluate the effect of RSV preventive interventions. These assessments include recording the incidence of RSV-specific LRTI and all-cause LRTI through two RSV seasons, and assessment of the prevalence and severity of recurrent wheezing or asthma in children aged up to 6 years. Standardised assessments in diverse settings are needed to fully determine the effect of interventions for the prevention of RSV disease."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Immune responses to influenza vaccines decline with age, reducing clinical effectiveness. We compared the effect of the more immunogenic high-dose trivalent influenza vaccine with a standard-dose vaccine to identify the effect on reducing hospital admissions of nursing home residents in the USA.
Methods
We did a single-blind, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness, cluster-randomised trial with a 2 × 2 factorial design. Medicare-certified nursing homes in the USA located within 50 miles of a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention influenza reporting city were recruited, so long as the facilities were not located in a hospital, had more than 50 long-stay residents, had less than 20% of the population aged under 65 years, and were not already planning to administer the high-dose influenza vaccine to residents. Enrolled nursing homes were randomised to a facility-wide standard of care for the residents of either high dose or standard dose as the vaccine for the 2013–14 influenza season and half of each group were randomly allocated to free vaccines for staff. Individual residents were included in the analysis group if they were aged 65 years or older and were long-stay residents (ie, had been in the facility 90 days or more before commencing the influenza vaccination programme). The analysts and investigators with access to the raw data were masked to study group by coding the groups until after the analyses were complete. The primary outcome was hospital admissions related to pulmonary and influenza-like illness between Nov 1, 2013, and May 31, 2014, identified from Medicare hospital claims available for residents who were without private health insurance (ie, those who were considered Medicare fee-for-service). We obtained data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and enrolled facilities. The analyses used marginal Poisson and Cox proportional hazards regression, accounting for clustering of residents within homes, on an intention-to-treat basis, adjusting for facility clustering and prespecified covariates. Safety data were voluntarily reported according to the standard of care. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01815268.
Findings
823 facilities were recruited to the study between March and August, 2013, to participate in the trial, of which 409 facilities were randomised for residents to receive high-dose vaccine, and 414 facilities for residents to receive standard-dose vaccine. The facilities housed 92 269, of whom 75 917 were aged 65 years or older and 53 008 were also long-stay residents, and 38 256 were matched to Medicare hospital claims as of Nov 1, 2013. Staff vaccination rates did not differ between groups, so analyses focused on the high-dose versus standard-dose vaccine comparison. On the basis of Medicare fee-for-service claims, the incidence of respiratory-related hospital admissions was significantly lower in facilities where residents received high-dose influenza vaccines than in those that received standard-dose influenza vaccines (0·185 per 1000 resident-days or 3·4% over 6 months vs 0·211 per 1000 resident-days or 3·9% over 6 months; unadjusted relative risk of 0·888, 95% CI 0·785–1·005, 0=0·061, and adjusted relative risk 0·873, 0·776–0·982, p=0·023).
Interpretation
When compared with standard-dose vaccine, high-dose influenza vaccine can reduce risk of respiratory-related hospital admissions from nursing home residents aged 65 years and older.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Benralizumab is an anti-eosinophilic, anti-interleukin-5 receptor α monoclonal antibody that has been shown to significantly reduce asthma exacerbations and improve lung function for patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma. We further explored the efficacy of benralizumab for patients with different baseline blood eosinophil thresholds and exacerbation histories.
Methods
This study is a pooled analysis of the results from the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled SIROCCO (NCT01928771) and CALIMA (NCT01914757) phase 3 studies. In these studies, patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive subcutaneous benralizumab 30 mg, either every 4 weeks or every 8 weeks (with first three doses given every 4 weeks), or placebo every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was annual exacerbation rate (AER) ratio versus placebo, analysed by baseline eosinophil counts (≥0, ≥150, ≥300, or ≥450 cells per μL) and by number of exacerbations (two vs three or more) during the year before enrolment. The analyses were done in accordance with the intention-to-treat principle.
Findings
Of 2295 patients, 756 received benralizumab every 4 weeks, 762 received benralizumab every 8 weeks, and 777 patients received placebo. AER among patients with baseline blood eosinophil counts of at least 0 cells per μL was 1·16 (95% CI 1·05–1·28) in patients who received placebo versus 0·75 (0·66–0·84) in patients who received benralizumab every 8 weeks (rate ratio 0·64, 0·55–0·75; p<0·0001). In patients who received benralizumab every 4 weeks who had eosinophil counts of 0 or more cells per μL, AER was 0·73 (0·65–0·82); rate ratio versus placebo was 0·63 (0·54–0·74; p<0·0001). The extent to which exacerbation rates were reduced increased with increasing blood eosinophil thresholds and with greater exacerbation history in patients in the 4-weekly and 8-weekly benralizumab groups. Greater improvements in AER were seen with benralizumab compared with placebo for patients with a combination of high blood eosinophil thresholds and a history of more frequent exacerbations.
Interpretation
These results will help to guide clinicians when they are deciding whether to use benralizumab to treat patients with severe, uncontrolled, eosinophilic asthma.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive parenchymal lung disease of complex cause. Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GER) and microaspiration have been proposed as risk factors for the development and progression of IPF, but robust definitive data are few. A recent international guideline conditionally recommended the use of antacid therapy (proton pump inhibitors or histamine-2-receptor antagonists) for patients with IPF, in the absence of oesophageal reflux or symptoms. In this Position Paper, we summarise the literature addressing the association between GER and IPF, and also identify future research priorities that could clarify this issue. We shed light on the process through which the guideline recommendation was achieved and aim to contextualise the recommendation for providers caring for patients with IPF."

Progress in sepsis research has been severely hampered by a heterogeneous disease phenotype, limiting the interpretation of clinical trials and the development of effective therapeutic interventions. Application of omics-based methodologies is advancing understanding of the dysregulated host immune response to infection in sepsis. However, the frequently elusive nature of the infecting organism in sepsis has limited efforts to understand the effect of disease heterogeneity involving the pathogen. Recent advances in nucleic acid sequencing-based pathogen analysis provide the opportunity for more accurate and comprehensive microbiological diagnosis. In this Review, we explore how better understanding of the host–pathogen interaction can substantially enhance, and in turn benefit from, current and future application of omics-based approaches to understand the host response in sepsis. We illustrate this using recent work accounting for heterogeneity involving the pathogen. We propose that there is a timely opportunity to further resolve sepsis heterogeneity by considering host–pathogen interactions, enabling progress towards a precision medicine approach."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The value of quantitative interferon-γ release assay results for predicting progression from Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection to active disease is unknown. We aimed to investigate the relation between QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) conversion interferon-γ values and risk of subsequent active tuberculosis disease and of QFT reversion.
Methods
We analysed data from a reported vaccine efficacy trial of the tuberculosis vaccine MVA85A in South Africa. QFT negative, HIV uninfected young children aged 18–24 weeks were enrolled. We stratified participants by quantitative QFT result (interferon-γ <0·35 IU/mL, 0·35–4·00 IU/mL, and >4·00 IU/mL) at the intermediate study visit (day 336) and determined risk of progression to active tuberculosis disease over the subsequent 6–24 months. No QFT differences were observed between placebo and MVA85A groups at day 336 or end of study; therefore, both groups were included in analyses. Study clinicians were not masked to QFT values, but strict case definitions were used that excluded QFT results. We used generalised additive models to evaluate the quantitative relation between day 336 QFT value and subsequent disease risk, and we compared disease rates between QFT strata using a two-sample Poisson test.
Findings
Among 2512 young children with QFT tests done at day 336, 172 (7%) were positive; 87 (7%) of 1267 in placebo group and 85 (7%) of 1245 in the MVA85A group (p=1·00). Compared with QFT non-converters (tuberculosis disease incidence 0·7 per 100 person-years [95% CI 0·4–1·1]), children with QFT conversion at interferon-γ values between 0·35–4·00 IU/mL did not have significantly increased risk of disease (2·5 per 100 person-years [95% CI 0·4–9·4]; incidence rate ratio (IRR) 3·7 (95% CI 0·4–15·8; p=0·23). However, QFT conversion at interferon-γ values higher than 4·00 IU/mL was associated with substantially increased disease incidence (28·0 per 100 person-years [95% CI 14·9–45·7]) compared with non-converters (IRR 42·5 [95% CI 17·2–99·7]; p<0·0001), and compared with children with interferon-γ values between 0·35–4·00 IU/mL (IRR 11·4 [95% CI 2·4–107·2]; p=0·00047). Among 91 QFT converters who were given a repeat test, 53 (58%) reverted from positive to negative. QFT reversion risk was inversely associated with interferon-γ value at QFT conversion and was highest with interferon-γ values less than 4·00 IU/mL (47 [77%] of 61).
Interpretation
In young children, tuberculosis disease risk was not significantly increased, and QFT reversion was common, following QFT conversion at interferon-γ values up to 10 times the recommended test threshold (0·35 IU/mL). By contrast, QFT conversion at very high interferon-γ values (>4·00 IU/mL) warrants intensified diagnostic and preventive intervention because of the extremely high risk of tuberculosis disease in these young children.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Macitentan is beneficial for long-term treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. The microvasculopathy of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) and pulmonary arterial hypertension are similar.
Methods
The phase 2, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled MERIT-1 trial assessed macitentan in 80 patients with CTEPH adjudicated as inoperable. Patients identified as WHO functional class II–IV with a pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) of at least 400 dyn·s/cm5 and a walk distance of 150–450 m in 6 min were randomly assigned (1:1), via an interactive voice/web response system, to receive oral macitentan (10 mg once a day) or placebo. Treatment with phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors and oral or inhaled prostanoids was permitted for WHO functional class III/IV patients. The primary endpoint was resting PVR at week 16, expressed as percentage of PVR measured at baseline. Analyses were done in all patients who were randomly assigned to treatment; safety analyses were done in all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02021292.
Findings
Between April 3, 2014, and March 17, 2016, we screened 186 patients for eligibility at 48 hospitals across 20 countries. Of these, 80 patients in 36 hospitals were randomly assigned to treatment (40 patients to macitentan, 40 patients to placebo). At week 16, geometric mean PVR decreased to 73·0% of baseline in the macitentan group and to 87·2% in the placebo group (geometric means ratio 0·84, 95% CI 0·70–0·99, p=0·041). The most common adverse events in the macitentan group were peripheral oedema (9 [23%] of 40 patients) and decreased haemoglobin (6 [15%]).
Interpretation
In MERIT-1, macitentan significantly improved PVR in patients with inoperable CTEPH and was well tolerated.

abstract = "Summary
Background
For patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and multiple brain metastases, whole-brain irradiation (WBI) is a standard-of-care treatment, but its effects on neurocognition are complex and concerning. We compared the efficacy of an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)–tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), icotinib, versus WBI with or without chemotherapy in a phase 3 trial of patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC and multiple brain metastases.
Methods
We did a multicentre, open-label, parallel randomised controlled trial (BRAIN) at 17 hospitals in China. Eligible participants were patients with NSCLC with EGFR mutations, who were naive to treatment with EGFR-TKIs or radiotherapy, and had at least three metastatic brain lesions. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to either icotinib 125 mg orally (three times per day) or WBI (30 Gy in ten fractions of 3 Gy) plus concurrent or sequential chemotherapy for 4–6 cycles, until unacceptable adverse events or intracranial disease progression occurred. The randomisation was done by the Chinese Thoracic Oncology Group with a web-based allocation system applying the Pocock and Simon minimisation method; groups were stratified by EGFR gene mutation status, treatment line (first line or second line), brain metastases only versus both intracranial and extracranial metastases, and presence or absence of symptoms of intracranial hypertension. Clinicians and patients were not masked to treatment assignment, but individuals involved in the data analysis did not participate in the treatments and were thus masked to allocation. Patients receiving icotinib who had intracranial progression only were switched to WBI plus either icotinib or chemotherapy until further progression; those receiving icotinib who had extracranial progression only were switched to icotinib plus chemotherapy. Patients receiving WBI who progressed were switched to icotinib until further progression. Icotinib could be continued beyond progression if a clinical benefit was observed by the investigators (eg, an improvement in cognition or intracranial pressure). The primary endpoint was intracranial progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from randomisation to either intracranial disease progression or death from any cause. We assessed efficacy and safety in the intention-to-treat population (all participants who received at least one dose of study treatment), hypothesising that intracranial PFS would be 40% longer (hazard ratio [HR] 0·60) with icotinib compared with WBI. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01724801.
Findings
Between Dec 10, 2012, and June 30, 2015, we assigned 176 participants to treatment: 85 to icotinib and 91 to WBI. 18 withdrew from the WBI group before treatment, leaving 73 for assessment. Median follow-up was 16·5 months (IQR 11·5–21·5). Median intracranial PFS was 10·0 months (95% CI 5·6–14·4) with icotinib versus 4·8 months (2·4–7·2) with WBI (equating to a 44% risk reduction with icotinib for an event of intracranial disease progression or death; HR 0·56, 95% CI 0·36–0·90; p=0·014). Adverse events of grade 3 or worse were reported in seven (8%) of 85 patients in the icotinib group and 28 (38%) of 73 patients in the WBI group. Raised concentrations of alanine aminotransferase and rash were the most common adverse events of any grade in both groups, occurring in around 20–30% of each group. At the time of final analysis, 42 (49%) patients in the icotinib group and 37 (51%) in the WBI group had died. 78 of these patients died from disease progression, and one patient in the WBI group died from thrombogenesis related to chemotherapy.
Interpretation
In patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC and multiple brain metastases, icotinib was associated with significantly longer intracranial PFS than WBI plus chemotherapy, indicating that icotinib might be a better first-line therapeutic option for this patient population.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Mepolizumab, an anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody approved as add-on therapy to standard of care for patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, has been shown in previous studies to reduce exacerbations and dependency on oral corticosteroids compared with placebo. We aimed to further assess mepolizumab in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma by examining its effect on health-related quality of life (HRQOL).
Methods
We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre, phase 3b trial (MUSCA) in 146 hospitals or research centres in 19 countries worldwide. Eligible participants were patients aged 12 years or older with severe eosinophilic asthma and a history of at least two exacerbations requiring treatment in the previous 12 months before screening despite regular use of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus other controller medicines. Exclusion criteria included current smokers or former smokers with a history of at least ten pack-years. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) by country to receive a subcutaneous injection of either mepolizumab 100 mg or placebo, plus standard of care, every 4 weeks for 24 weeks (the final dose was given at week 20). We did the randomisation using an interactive voice response system and a centralised, computer-generated, permuted-block design of block size six. The two treatments were identical in appearance and administered in a masked manner; patients, investigators, other site staff and the entire study team including those assessing outcomes data were also masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was the mean change from baseline in the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score at week 24 in the modified intention-to-treat (modified ITT) population (analysed according to their randomly assigned treatment). Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of trial medication (analysed according to the actual treatment received). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02281318.
Findings
We recruited patients between Dec 11, 2014, and Nov 20, 2015, and the study was undertaken between Dec 11, 2014, and June 10, 2016. The modified ITT population comprised 274 patients assigned to mepolizumab 100 mg and 277 assigned to placebo. Mepolizumab versus placebo showed significant improvements at week 24 from baseline in SGRQ total score (least squares mean [SE] change from baseline −15·6 (1·0) vs −7·9 (1·0), a treatment difference of −7·7 (95% CI −10·5 to −4·9; p<0·0001). No deaths occurred during the study. 192 (70%) of 273 patients who received mepolizumab and 207 (74%) of 278 who received placebo reported at least one on-treatment adverse event, the most common of which were headache (in 45 [16%] given mepolizumab vs 59 [21%] given placebo) and nasopharyngitis (in 31 [11%] given mepolizumab vs 46 [17%] given placebo). 15 (5%) and 22 (8%) patients had an on-treatment serious adverse event in the mepolizumab and placebo groups, respectively; the most common was asthma in both groups (in three [1%] given mepolizumab vs nine [3%] given placebo).
Interpretation
Mepolizumab was associated with significant improvements in HRQOL in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, and had a safety profile similar to that of placebo. These results add to and support the use of mepolizumab as a favourable add-on treatment option to standard of care in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Guidelines recommend endosonography with fine-needle aspiration for mediastinal nodal staging in non-small-cell lung cancer, but most do not specify whether this should be through endobronchial endoscopy (EBUS), oesophageal endoscopy (EUS), or both. We assessed the added value and diagnostic accuracy of the combined use of EBUS and EUS.
Methods
For this systematic review and random effects meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, BIOSIS Previews, and Web of Science, without language restrictions, for studies published between Jan 1, 2000, and Feb 25, 2016. We included studies that assessed the accuracy of the combined use of EBUS and EUS in detecting mediastinal nodal metastases (N2/N3 disease) in patients with lung cancer. For each included study, we extracted data on the age and sex of participants, inclusion criteria regarding tumour stage on imaging, details of the endoscopic testing protocol, duration of each endoscopic procedure, number of lymph nodes sampled, serious adverse events occurring during the endoscopic procedures, the reference standard, and 2 × 2 tables for EBUS, EUS, and the combined approach. We evaluated the added value (absolute increase in sensitivity and in detection rate) of the combined use of EBUS and EUS in detecting mediastinal nodal metastases over either test alone, and the diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and negative predictive value) of the combined approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42015019249.
Findings
We identified 2567 unique manuscripts by database search, of which 13 studies (including 2395 patients) were included in the analysis. Median prevalence of N2/N3 disease was 34% (range 23–71). On average, addition of EUS to EBUS increased sensitivity by 0·12 (95% CI 0·08–0·18) and addition of EBUS to EUS increased sensitivity by 0·22 (0·16–0·29). Mean sensitivity of the combined approach was 0·86 (0·81–0·90), and the mean negative predictive value was 0·92 (0·89–0·93). The mean negative predictive value was significantly higher in studies with a prevalence of 34% or less (0·93 [95% CI 0·91–0·95]) compared with studies with a prevalence of more than 34% (0·89 [0·85–0·91]; p=0·013). We found no significant differences in mean sensitivity and negative predictive value between studies that did EBUS first or EUS first, or between studies that used an EBUS-scope or a regular echoendoscope to do EUS.
Interpretation
The combined use of EBUS and EUS significantly improves sensitivity in detecting mediastinal nodal metastases, reducing the need for surgical staging procedures.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Bi-allelic mutations of the EIF2AK4 gene cause heritable pulmonary veno-occlusive disease and/or pulmonary capillary haemangiomatosis (PVOD/PCH). We aimed to assess the effect of EIF2AK4 mutations on the clinical phenotypes and outcomes of PVOD/PCH.
Methods
We did a population-based study using clinical, functional, and haemodynamic data from the registry of the French Pulmonary Hypertension Network. We reviewed the clinical data and outcomes from all patients referred to the French Referral Centre (Pulmonary Department, Hospital Kremlin-Bicêtre, University Paris-Sud) with either confirmed or highly probable PVOD/PCH with DNA available for mutation screening (excluding patients with other risk factors of pulmonary hypertension, such as chronic respiratory diseases). We sequenced the coding sequence and intronic junctions of the EIF2AK4 gene, and compared clinical characteristics and outcomes between EIF2AK4 mutation carriers and non-carriers. Medical therapies approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension (prostacyclin derivatives, endothelin receptor antagonists and phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors) were given to patients according to the clinical judgment and discretion of treating physicians. The primary outcome was the event-free survival (death or transplantation). Secondary outcomes included response to therapies for pulmonary arterial hypertension and survival after lung transplantation. A satisfactory clinical response to specific therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension was defined by achieving New York Heart Association functional class I or II, a 6-min walk distance of more than 440 m, and a cardiac index greater than 2·5 L/min per m2 at the first reassessment after initiation of specific therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Findings
We obtained data from Jan 1, 2003, to June 1, 2016, and identified 94 patients with sporadic or heritable PVOD/PCH (confirmed or highly probable). 27 (29%) of these patients had bi-allelic EIF2AK4 mutations. PVOD/PCH due to EIF2AK4 mutations occurred from birth to age 50 years, and these patients were younger at presentation than non-carriers (median 26·0 years [range 0–50.3] vs 60·0 years [6·7–81·4] years; p<0·0001). At diagnosis, both mutations carriers and non-carriers had similarly severe precapillary pulmonary hypertension and functional impairment. 22 (81%) of mutations carriers and 63 (94%) of non-carriers received therapy approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension. Drug-induced pulmonary oedema occurred in five (23%) of treated EIF2AK4 mutations carriers and 13 (21%) of treated non-carriers. Follow-up assessment after initiation of treatment showed that only three (4%) patients with PVOD/PCH reached the predefined criteria for satisfactory clinical response. The probabilities of event-free survival (death or transplantation) at 1 and 3 years were 63% and 32% in EIF2AK4 mutations carriers, and 75% and 34% in non-carriers. No significant differences occurred in event-free survival between the 2 groups (p=0·38). Among the 33 patients who had lung transplantation, estimated post-transplantation survival rates at 1, 2, and 5 years were 84%, 81%, and 73%, respectively.
Interpretation
Heritable PVOD/PCH due to bi-allelic EIF2AK4 mutations is characterised by a younger age at diagnosis but these patients display similar disease severity compared with mutation non-carriers. Response to therapy approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension in PVOD/PCH is rare. PVOD/PCH is a devastating condition and lung transplantation should be considered for eligible patients.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Purified α1 proteinase inhibitor (A1PI) slowed emphysema progression in patients with severe α1 antitrypsin deficiency in a randomised controlled trial (RAPID-RCT), which was followed by an open-label extension trial (RAPID-OLE). The aim was to investigate the prolonged treatment effect of A1PI on the progression of emphysema as assessed by the loss of lung density in relation to RAPID-RCT.
Methods
Patients who had received either A1PI treatment (Zemaira or Respreeza; early-start group) or placebo (delayed-start group) in the RAPID-RCT trial were included in this 2-year open-label extension trial (RAPID-OLE). Patients from 22 hospitals in 11 countries outside of the USA received 60 mg/kg per week A1PI. The primary endpoint was annual rate of adjusted 15th percentile lung density loss measured using CT in the intention-to-treat population with a mixed-effects regression model. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00670007.
Findings
Between March 1, 2006, and Oct 13, 2010, 140 patients from RAPID-RCT entered RAPID-OLE: 76 from the early-start group and 64 from the delayed-start group. Between day 1 and month 24 (RAPID-RCT), the rate of lung density loss in RAPID-OLE patients was lower in the early-start group (−1·51 g/L per year [SE 0·25] at total lung capacity [TLC]; −1·55 g/L per year [0·24] at TLC plus functional residual capacity [FRC]; and −1·60 g/L per year [0·26] at FRC) than in the delayed-start group (−2·26 g/L per year [0·27] at TLC; −2·16 g/L per year [0·26] at TLC plus FRC, and −2·05 g/L per year [0·28] at FRC). Between months 24 and 48, the rate of lung density loss was reduced in delayed-start patients (from −2·26 g/L per year to −1·26 g/L per year), but no significant difference was seen in the rate in early-start patients during this time period (−1·51 g/L per year to −1·63 g/L per year), thus in early-start patients the efficacy was sustained to month 48.
Interpretation
RAPID-OLE supports the continued efficacy of A1PI in slowing disease progression during 4 years of treatment. Lost lung density was never recovered, highlighting the importance of early intervention with A1PI treatment.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Scant information exists about the epidemiological characteristics and outcome of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) at risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and how ventilation is managed in these individuals. We aimed to establish the epidemiological characteristics of patients at risk of ARDS, describe ventilation management in this population, and assess outcomes compared with people at no risk of ARDS.
Methods
PRoVENT (PRactice of VENTilation in critically ill patients without ARDS at onset of ventilation) is an international, multicentre, prospective study undertaken at 119 ICUs in 16 countries worldwide. All patients aged 18 years or older who were receiving mechanical ventilation in participating ICUs during a 1-week period between January, 2014, and January, 2015, were enrolled into the study. The Lung Injury Prediction Score (LIPS) was used to stratify risk of ARDS, with a score of 4 or higher defining those at risk of ARDS. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients at risk of ARDS. Secondary outcomes included ventilatory management (including tidal volume [VT] expressed as mL/kg predicted bodyweight [PBW], and positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP] expressed as cm H2O), development of pulmonary complications, and clinical outcomes. The PRoVENT study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01868321. The study has been completed.
Findings
Of 3023 patients screened for the study, 935 individuals fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of these critically ill patients, 282 were at risk of ARDS (30%, 95% CI 27–33), representing 0·14 cases per ICU bed over a 1-week period. VT was similar for patients at risk and not at risk of ARDS (median 7·6 mL/kg PBW [IQR 6·7–9·1] vs 7·9 mL/kg PBW [6·8–9·1]; p=0·346). PEEP was higher in patients at risk of ARDS compared with those not at risk (median 6·0 cm H2O [IQR 5·0–8·0] vs 5·0 cm H2O [5·0–7·0]; p<0·0001). The prevalence of ARDS in patients at risk of ARDS was higher than in individuals not at risk of ARDS (19/260 [7%] vs 17/556 [3%]; p=0·004). Compared with individuals not at risk of ARDS, patients at risk of ARDS had higher in-hospital mortality (86/543 [16%] vs 74/232 [32%]; p<0·0001), ICU mortality (62/533 [12%] vs 66/227 [29%]; p<0·0001), and 90-day mortality (109/653 [17%] vs 88/282 [31%]; p<0·0001). VT did not differ between patients who did and did not develop ARDS (p=0·471 for those at risk of ARDS; p=0·323 for those not at risk).
Interpretation
Around a third of patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU were at risk of ARDS. Pulmonary complications occur frequently in patients at risk of ARDS and their clinical outcome is worse compared with those not at risk of ARDS. There is potential for improvement in the management of patients without ARDS. Further refinements are needed for prediction of ARDS.

abstract = "Summary
The US National Lung Screening Trial showed that individuals randomly assigned to screening with low-dose CT scans had 20% lower lung cancer mortality than did those screened with conventional chest radiography. On the basis of a review of the literature and a modelling study, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends annual screening for lung cancer for individuals aged 55–80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and either currently smoke or quit smoking within the past 15 years. However, the balance between benefits and harms of lung cancer screening is still greatly debated. The large number of false-positive results and the potential for overdiagnosis are causes for concern. Some investigators suggest the ratio between benefits and harms could be improved through various means. Nevertheless, many questions remain with regard to the implementation of lung cancer screening. This paper highlights the latest developments in CT lung cancer screening and provides an overview of the main unanswered questions."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Eosinophilic airway inflammation is often present in asthma, and reduction of such inflammation results in improved clinical outcomes. We hypothesised that fevipiprant (QAW039), an antagonist of prostaglandin D2 receptor 2, might reduce eosinophilic airway inflammation in patients with moderate-to-severe eosinophilic asthma.
Methods
We performed a single-centre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial at Glenfield Hospital (Leicester, UK). We recruited patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma and an elevated sputum eosinophil count (≥2%). After a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by the trial pharmacist, using previously generated treatment allocation cards, to receive fevipiprant (225 mg twice per day orally) or placebo, stratified by the use of oral corticosteroid treatment and bronchoscopy. The 12-week treatment period was followed by a 6-week single-blind placebo washout period. The primary outcome was the change in sputum eosinophil percentage from baseline to 12 weeks after treatment, analysed in the intention-to-treat population. All patients who received at least one dose of study drug were included in the safety analyses. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01545726, and with EudraCT, number 2011-004966-13.
Findings
Between Feb 10, 2012, and Jan 30, 2013, 61 patients were randomly assigned to receive fevipiprant (n=30) or placebo (n=31). Three patients in the fevipiprant group and four patients in the placebo group withdrew because of asthma exacerbations. Two patients in the fevipiprant group were incorrectly given placebo (one at the mid-treatment visit and one throughout the course of the study). They were both included in the fevipiprant group for the primary analysis, but the patient who was incorrectly given placebo throughout was included in the placebo group for the safety analyses. Between baseline and 12 weeks after treatment, sputum eosinophil percentage decreased from a geometric mean of 5·4% (95% CI 3·1–9·6) to 1·1% (0·7–1·9) in the fevipiprant group and from 4·6% (2·5–8·7) to 3·9% (CI 2·3–6·7) in the placebo group. Compared with baseline, mean sputum eosinophil percentage was reduced by 4·5 times in the fevipiprant group and by 1·3 times in the placebo group (difference between groups 3·5 times, 95% CI 1·7–7·0; p=0·0014). Fevipiprant had a favourable safety profile, with no deaths or serious adverse events reported. No patient withdrawals were judged by the investigator to be related to the study drug.
Interpretation
Fevipiprant reduces eosinophilic airway inflammation and is well tolerated in patients with persistent moderate-to-severe asthma and raised sputum eosinophil counts despite inhaled corticosteroid treatment.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Antimicrobial resistance is a serious threat to public health, with most antibiotics prescribed in primary care. General practitioners (GPs) report defensive antibiotic prescribing to mitigate perceived risk of future hospital admission in children with respiratory tract infections. We developed a clinical rule aimed to reduce clinical uncertainty by stratifying risk of future hospital admission.
Methods
8394 children aged between 3 months and 16 years presenting with acute cough (for ≤28 days) and respiratory tract infection were recruited to a prognostic cohort study from 247 general practitioner practices in England. Exposure variables included demographic characteristics, parent-reported symptoms, and physical examination signs. The outcome was hospital admission for respiratory tract infection within 30 days, collected using a structured, blinded review of medical records.
Findings
8394 (100%) children were included in the analysis, with 78 (0·9%, 95% CI 0·7%–1·2%) admitted to hospital: 15 (19%) were admitted on the day of recruitment (day 1), 33 (42%) on days 2–7; and 30 (39%) on days 8–30. Seven characteristics were independently associated (p<0·01) with hospital admission: age <2 years, current asthma, illness duration of 3 days or less, parent-reported moderate or severe vomiting in the previous 24 h, parent-reported severe fever in the previous 24 h or a body temperature of 37·8°C or more at presentation, clinician-reported intercostal or subcostal recession, and clinician-reported wheeze on auscultation. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve for the coefficient-based clinical rule was 0·82 (95% CI 0·77–0·87, bootstrap validated 0·81). Assigning one point per characteristic, a points-based clinical rule consisting of short illness, temperature, age, recession, wheeze, asthma, and vomiting (mnemonic STARWAVe; AUROC 0·81, 0·76–0·85) distinguished three hospital admission risk strata: very low (0·3%, 0·2–0·4%) with 1 point or less, normal (1·5%, 1·0–1·9%) with 2 or 3 points, and high (11·8%, 7·3–16·2%) with 4 points or more.
Interpretation
Clinical characteristics can distinguish children at very low, normal, and high risk of future hospital admission for respiratory tract infection and could be used to reduce antibiotic prescriptions in primary care for children at very low risk.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Patients with bronchiectasis often have concurrent comorbidities, but the nature, prevalence, and impact of these comorbidities on disease severity and outcome are poorly understood. We aimed to investigate comorbidities in patients with bronchiectasis and establish their prognostic value on disease severity and mortality rate.
Methods
An international multicentre cohort analysis of outpatients with bronchiectasis from four European centres followed up for 5 years was done for score derivation. Eligible patients were those with bronchiectasis confirmed by high-resolution CT and a compatible clinical history. Comorbidity diagnoses were based on standardised definitions and were obtained from full review of paper and electronic medical records, prescriptions, and investigator definitions. Weibull parametric survival analysis was used to model the prediction of the 5 year mortality rate to construct the Bronchiectasis Aetiology Comorbidity Index (BACI). We tested the BACI as a predictor of outcomes and explored whether the BACI added further prognostic information when used alongside the Bronchiectasis Severity Index (BSI). The BACI was validated in two independent international cohorts from the UK and Serbia.
Findings
Between June 1, 2006, and Nov 22, 2013, 1340 patients with bronchiectasis were screened and 986 patients were analysed. Patients had a median of four comorbidities (IQR 2–6; range 0–20). 13 comorbidities independently predicting mortality rate were integrated into the BACI. The overall hazard ratio for death conferred by a one-point increase in the BACI was 1·18 (95% CI 1·14–1·23; p<0·0001). The BACI predicted 5 year mortality rate, hospital admissions, exacerbations, and health-related quality of life across all BSI risk strata (p<0·0001 for mortality and hospital admissions, p=0·03 for exacerbations, p=0·0008 for quality of life). When used in conjunction with the BSI, the combined model was superior to either model alone (p=0·01 for combined vs BACI; p=0·008 for combined vs BSI).
Interpretation
Multimorbidity is frequent in bronchiectasis and can negatively affect survival. The BACI complements the BSI in the assessment and prediction of mortality and disease outcomes in patients with bronchiectasis.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Several aggregate data meta-analyses have provided estimates of the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in community-dwelling elderly people. However, these studies ignored the effects of patient-level confounders such as sex, age, and chronic diseases that could bias effectiveness estimates. We aimed to assess the confounder-adjusted effectiveness of influenza vaccines on laboratory-confirmed influenza among elderly people by conducting a global individual participant data meta-analysis.
Methods
In this individual participant data meta-analysis, we considered studies included in a previously conducted aggregate data meta-analysis that included test-negative design case-control studies published up to July 13, 2014. We contacted all authors of the included studies on Dec 1, 2014, to request individual participant data. Patients were excluded if their unique identifier was missing, their vaccination status was unknown, their outcome status was unknown, or they had had suspected influenza infection more than once in the same influenza season. Cases were patients with influenza-like illness symptoms who tested positive for at least one of A H1N1, A H1N1 pdm09, A H3N2, or B viruses; controls were patients with influenza-like illness symptoms who tested negative for these virus types or subtypes. Influenza vaccine effectiveness against overall and subtype-specific laboratory-confirmed influenza were the primary and secondary outcomes. We used a generalised linear mixed model to calculate adjusted vaccine effectiveness according to vaccine match to the circulating strains of influenza virus and intensity of the virus activity (epidemic or non-epidemic). Vaccine effectiveness was defined as the relative reduction in risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza in vaccinated patients compared with unvaccinated patients. We did subgroup analyses to estimate vaccine effectiveness according to hemisphere, age category, and health status.
Findings
We received 23 of the 53 datasets included in the aggregate data meta-analysis. Furthermore, six additional datasets were provided by data collaborators, which resulted in individual participant data for a total of 5210 participants. A total of 4975 patients had the required data for analysis. Of these, 3146 (63%) were controls and 1829 (37%) were cases. Influenza vaccination was significantly effective during epidemic seasons irrespective of vaccine match status (matched adjusted vaccine effectiveness 44·38%, 95% CI 22·63–60·01; mismatched adjusted vaccine effectiveness 20·00%, 95% CI 3·46–33·68; analyses in the imputed dataset). Seasonal influenza vaccination did not show significant effectiveness during non-epidemic seasons. We found substantial variation in vaccine effectiveness across virus types and subtypes, with the highest estimate for A H1N1 pdm09 (53·19%, 10·25–75·58) and the lowest estimate for B virus types (−1·52%, −39·58 to 26·16). Although we observed no significant differences between subgroups in each category (hemisphere, age, and health status), influenza vaccination showed a protective effect among elderly people with cardiovascular disease, lung disease, or aged 75 years and younger.
Interpretation
Influenza vaccination is moderately effective against laboratory-confirmed influenza in elderly people during epidemic seasons. More research is needed to investigate factors affecting vaccine protection (eg, brand-specific or type-specific vaccine effectiveness and repeated annual vaccination) in elderly people.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Optimal sedation of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) requires the avoidance of pain, agitation, and unnecessary deep sedation, but these outcomes are challenging to achieve. Excessive sedation can prolong ICU stay, whereas light sedation can increase pain and frightening memories, which are commonly recalled by ICU survivors. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of three interventions to improve sedation and analgesia quality: an online education programme; regular feedback of sedation–analgesia quality data; and use of a novel sedation-monitoring technology (the Responsiveness Index [RI]).
Methods
We did a cluster randomised trial in eight ICUs, which were randomly allocated to receive education alone (two ICUs), education plus sedation–analgesia quality feedback (two ICUs), education plus RI monitoring technology (two ICUs), or all three interventions (two ICUs). Randomisation was done with computer-generated random permuted blocks, stratified according to recruitment start date. A 45 week baseline period was followed by a 45 week intervention period, separated by an 8 week implementation period in which the interventions were introduced. ICU and research staff were not masked to study group assignment during the intervention period. All mechanically ventilated patients were potentially eligible. We assessed patients' sedation–analgesia quality for each 12 h period of nursing care, and sedation-related adverse events daily. Our primary outcome was the proportion of care periods with optimal sedation–analgesia, defined as being free from excessive sedation, agitation, poor limb relaxation, and poor ventilator synchronisation. Analysis used multilevel generalised linear mixed modelling to explore intervention effects in a single model taking clustering and patient-level factors into account. A concurrent mixed-methods process evaluation was undertaken to help understand the trial findings. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01634451.
Findings
Between June 1, 2012, and Dec 31, 2014, we included 881 patients (9187 care periods) during the baseline period and 591 patients (6947 care periods) during the intervention period. During the baseline period, optimal sedation–analgesia was present for 5150 (56%) care periods. We found a significant improvement in optimal sedation–analgesia with RI monitoring (odds ratio [OR] 1·44 [95% CI 1·07–1·95]; p=0·017), which was mainly due to increased periods free from excessive sedation (OR 1·59 [1·09–2·31]) and poor ventilator synchronisation (OR 1·55 [1·05–2·30]). However, more patients experienced sedation-related adverse events (OR 1·91 [1·02–3·58]). We found no improvement in overall optimal sedation–analgesia with education (OR 1·13 [95% CI 0·86–1·48]), but fewer patients experienced sedation-related adverse events (OR 0·56 [0·32–0·99]). The sedation–analgesia quality data feedback did not improve quality (OR 0·74 [95% CI 0·54–1·00]) or sedation-related adverse events (OR 1·15 [0·61–2·15]). The process evaluation suggested many clinicians found the RI monitoring useful, but it was often not used for decision making as intended. Education was valued and considered useful by staff. By contrast, sedation–analgesia quality feedback was poorly understood and thought to lack relevance to bedside nursing practice.
Interpretation
Combination of RI monitoring and online education has the potential to improve sedation–analgesia quality and patient safety in mechanically ventilated ICU patients. The RI monitoring seemed to improve sedation–analgesia quality, but inconsistent adoption by bedside nurses limited its impact. The online education programme resulted in a clinically relevant improvement in patient safety and was valued by nurses, but any changes to behaviours did not seem to alter other measures of sedation–analgesia quality. Providing sedation–analgesia quality feedback to ICUs did not appear to improve any quality metrics, probably because staff did not think it relevant to bedside practice.

Background
Targeted screening and treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection substantially reduces the risk of developing active tuberculosis. C-Tb (Statens Serum Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark) is a novel specific skin test based on ESAT-6 and CFP10 antigens. We investigated the safety and diagnostic potential of C-Tb compared with established tests in the contact-tracing setting.
Methods
Negative controls, close contacts, occasional contacts, and patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis were enrolled at 13 centres in Spain. We compared C-Tb with the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube ([QFT] Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) interferon γ release assay (IGRA) and the purified protein derivative (PPD) RT 23 tuberculin skin test ([TST] Statens Serum Institute). All participants older than 5 years were tested with QFT. Some participants in the negative control group received C-Tb without the TST to test for potential interactions between C-Tb and PPD RT 23. The rest were randomly assigned in blocks of ten and tested with both C-Tb and TST, with five in each block receiving injection of C-Tb in the right arm and the TST in the left arm and five vice versa. The primary and safety analyses were done in all participants randomly assigned to a group who received any test. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01631266, and with EudraCT, number 2011-005617-36.
Findings
From July 24, 2012, to Oct 2, 2014, 979 participants were enrolled, of whom 263 were negative controls, 299 were occasional contacts, 316 were close contacts, and 101 were patients with tuberculosis. 970 (99%) participants completed the trial. Induration sizes were similar for C-Tb and TST, but TST positivity was affected by BCG vaccination status. We found a strong positive trend towards C-Tb test positivity with increasing risk of infection, from 3% in negative controls to 16% in occasional contacts, to 43% in close contacts. C-Tb and QFT results were concordant in 785 (94%) of 834 participants aged 5 years and older, and results did not differ significantly between exposure groups. The safety profile of C-Tb was similar to that for the TST.
Interpretation
C-Tb delivered IGRA-like results in a field-friendly format. Being unaffected by BCG vaccination status, the C-Tb skin test might provide more accurate treatment guidance in settings where the TST is commonly used.

abstract = "Summary
Occupational exposure is an important, global cause of respiratory disease. Unlike many other non-communicable lung diseases, the proximal causes of many occupational lung diseases are well understood and they should be amenable to control with use of established and effective approaches. Therefore, the risks arising from exposure to silica and asbestos are well known, as are the means of their prevention. Although the incidence of occupational lung disease has decreased in many countries, in parts of the world undergoing rapid economic transition and population growth—often with large informal and unregulated workforces—occupational exposures continue to impose a heavy burden of disease. The incidence of interstitial and malignant lung diseases remains unacceptably high because control measures are not implemented or exposures arise in novel ways. With the advent of innovative technologies, new threats are continually introduced to the workplace (eg, indium compounds and vicinal diketones). In developed countries, work-related asthma is the commonest occupational lung disease of short latency. Although generic control measures to reduce the risk of developing or exacerbating asthma are well recognised, there is still uncertainty, for example, with regards to the management of workers who develop asthma but remain in the same job. In this Review, we provide recommendations for research, surveillance, and other action for reducing the burden of occupational lung diseases."

abstract = "Summary
Background
12 months of oral cyclophosphamide has been shown to alter the progression of scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease when compared with placebo. However, toxicity was a concern and without continued treatment the efficacy disappeared by 24 months. We hypothesised that a 2 year course of mycophenolate mofetil would be safer, better tolerated, and produce longer lasting improvements than cyclophosphamide.
Methods
This randomised, double-blind, parallel group trial enrolled patients from 14 US medical centres with scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease meeting defined dyspnoea, pulmonary function, and high-resolution CT (HRCT) criteria. The data coordinating centre at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA, CA, USA), randomly assigned patients using a double-blind, double-dummy, centre-blocked design to receive either mycophenolate mofetil (target dose 1500 mg twice daily) for 24 months or oral cyclophosphamide (target dose 2·0 mg/kg per day) for 12 months followed by placebo for 12 months. Drugs were given in matching 250 mg gel capsules. The primary endpoint, change in forced vital capacity as a percentage of the predicted normal value (FVC %) over the course of 24 months, was assessed in a modified intention-to-treat analysis using an inferential joint model combining a mixed-effects model for longitudinal outcomes and a survival model to handle non-ignorable missing data. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00883129.
Findings
Between Sept 28, 2009, and Jan 14, 2013, 142 patients were randomly assigned to either mycophenolate mofetil (n=69) or cyclophosphamide (n=73). 126 patients (mycophenolate mofetil [n=63] and cyclophosphamide [n=63]) with acceptable baseline HRCT studies and at least one outcome measure were included in the primary analysis. The adjusted % predicted FVC improved from baseline to 24 months by 2·19 in the mycophenolate mofetil group (95% CI 0·53–3·84) and 2·88 in the cyclophosphamide group (1·19–4·58). The course of the % FVC did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups based on the prespecified primary analysis using a joint model (p=0·24), indicating that the trial was negative for the primary endpoint. However, in a post-hoc analysis of the primary endpoint, the within-treatment change from baseline to 24 months derived from the joint model showed that the % FVC improved significantly in both the mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide groups. 16 (11%) patients died (five [7%] mycophenolate mofetil and 11 [15%] cyclophosphamide), with most due to progressive interstitial lung disease. Leucopenia (30 patients vs four patients) and thrombocytopenia (four vs zero) occurred more often in patients given cyclophosphamide than mycophenolate mofetil. Fewer patients on mycophenolate mofetil than on cyclophosphamide prematurely withdrew from study drug (20 vs 32) or met prespecified criteria for treatment failure (zero vs two). The time to stopping treatment was shorter in the cyclophosphamide group (p=0·019).
Interpretation
Treatment of scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease with mycophenolate mofetil for 2 years or cyclophosphamide for 1 year both resulted in significant improvements in prespecified measures of lung function over the 2 year course of the study. Although mycophenolate mofetil was better tolerated and associated with less toxicity, the hypothesis that it would have greater efficacy at 24 months than cyclophosphamide was not confirmed. These findings support the potential clinical effectiveness of both cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil for progressive scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease, and the present preference for mycophenolate mofetil because of its better tolerability and toxicity profile.

abstract = "Summary
Despite the development of pharmacological therapies that are effective in slowing the progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), it remains a debilitating and lethal condition. In addition to the adverse effects caused by pulmonary fibrosis, most patients with IPF have associated comorbid conditions, which might negatively affect functional status, quality of life, and survival. Comorbid conditions can be pulmonary or extrapulmonary. Pulmonary comorbidities include pulmonary hypertension, emphysema, and lung cancer, while non-pulmonary conditions include venous thromboembolism, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, sleep-disordered breathing, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and anxiety or depression. Although some of these comorbid conditions share risk factors with IPF, the likelihood for their presence or development in patients with IPF is still greater than expected. This might indicate that IPF fosters an environment for the development or perpetuation of comorbid conditions, or alternatively that they share causative factors. Optimal management of IPF therefore requires a comprehensive approach, which includes the identification and treatment of comorbid conditions to optimise patient outcomes."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Many individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remain undiagnosed worldwide. Health-care organisations are implementing case-finding programmes without good evidence of which are the most effective and cost-effective approaches. We assessed the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two alternative approaches to targeted case finding for COPD compared with routine practice.
Methods
In this cluster-randomised controlled trial, participating general practices in the West Midlands, UK, were randomly assigned (1:1), via a computer-generated block randomisation sequence, to either a targeted case-finding group or a routine care group. Eligible patients were ever-smokers aged 40–79 years without a previously recorded diagnosis of COPD. Patients in the targeted case-finding group were further randomly assigned (1:1) via their household to receive either a screening questionnaire at the general practitioner (GP) consultation (opportunistic) or a screening questionnaire at the GP consultation plus a mailed questionnaire (active). Respondents reporting relevant respiratory symptoms were invited for post-bronchodilator spirometry. Patients, clinicians, and investigators were not masked to allocation, but group allocation was concealed from the researchers who performed the spirometry assessments. Primary outcomes were the percentage of the eligible population diagnosed with COPD within 1 year (defined as post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1] to forced vital capacity [FVC] ratio <0·7 in patients with symptoms or a new diagnosis on their GP record) and cost per new COPD diagnosis. Multiple logistic and Poisson regression were used to estimate effect sizes. Costs were obtained from the trial. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN14930255.
Findings
From Aug 10, 2012, to June 22, 2014, 74 818 eligible patients from 54 diverse general practices were randomly assigned and completed the trial. At 1 year, 1278 (4%) cases of COPD were newly detected in 32 789 eligible patients in the targeted case-finding group compared with 337 (1%) cases in 42 029 patients in the routine care group (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 7·45 [95% CI 4·80–11·55], p<0·0001). The percentage of newly detected COPD cases was higher in the active case-finding group (822 [5%] of 15 378) than in the opportunistic case-finding group (370 [2%] of 15 387; adjusted OR 2·34 [2·06–2·66], p<0·0001; adjusted risk difference 2·9 per 100 patients [95% CI 2·3–3·6], p<0·0001). Active case finding was more cost-effective than opportunistic case finding (£333 vs £376 per case detected, respectively).
Interpretation
In this well established primary care system, routine practice identified few new cases of COPD. An active targeted approach to case finding including mailed screening questionnaires before spirometry is a cost-effective way to identify undiagnosed patients and has the potential to improve their health.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Neuraminidase inhibitors are effective for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza. However, there is an unmet need for intravenous treatment for patients admitted to hospital with severe influenza. We studied whether intravenous zanamivir was a suitable treatment in this setting.
Methods
In this international, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients aged 16 years or older with severe influenza admitted to 97 hospitals from 26 countries. We randomly assigned patients (1:1:1 stratified by symptom onset ≤4 days or 5–6 days) to receive 300 mg or 600 mg intravenous zanamivir, or standard-of-care (75 mg oral oseltamivir) twice a day for 5–10 days; patients were followed up for 28 days. The randomisation schedule, including stratification, was generated using GlaxoSmithKline's RandAll software. Patients, site study staff, and sponsor were masked to study treatment. The primary endpoint was time to clinical response—a composite of vital sign stabilisation and hospital discharge—in the influenza-positive population. The trial was powered to show an improvement of 1·5 days or greater with 600 mg intravenous zanamivir. Pharmacokinetic, safety, and virology endpoints were also assessed. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01231620.
Findings
Between Jan 15, 2011, and Feb 12, 2015, 626 patients were randomly assigned to receive 300 mg intravenous zanamivir (n=201), 600 mg intravenous zanamivir (n=209), or 75 mg oral oseltamivir (n=205) twice a day; 11 patients discontinued the study before receiving any study treatment. 488 (78%) of 626 patients had laboratory-confirmed influenza. Compared with a median time to clinical response of 5·14 days in the 600 mg intravenous zanamivir group, the median time to clinical response was 5·87 days (difference of −0·73 days, 95% CI −1·79 to 0·75; p=0·25) in the 300 mg intravenous zanamivir group and 5·63 days (difference of −0·48 days, 95% CI −2·11 to 0·97; p=0·39) in the oseltamivir group. Four patients with influenza A/H1N1pdm09 in the oseltamivir group developed H275Y resistance mutations. Adverse events were reported in 373 (61%) of treated patients and were similar across treatment groups; the most common adverse events (300 mg intravenous zanamivir, 600 mg intravenous zanamivir, oseltamivir) were diarrhoea (10 [5%], 15 [7%], 14 [7%]), respiratory failure (11 [5%], 14 [7%], 11 [5%]), and constipation (7 [3%], 13 [6%], 10 [5%]). 41 (7%) treated patients died during the study (15 [7%], 15 [7%], 11 [5%]); the most common causes of death were respiratory failure and septic shock.
Interpretation
Time to clinical response to intravenous zanamivir dosed at 600 mg was not superior to oseltamivir or 300 mg intravenous zanamivir. All treatments had a similar safety profile in hospitalised patients with severe influenza.

abstract = "Summary
Background
In clinical trials of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, rates of all-cause mortality are low. Thus prospective mortality trials are logistically very challenging, justifying the use of pooled analyses or meta-analyses. We did pooled analyses and meta-analyses of clinical trials of pirfenidone versus placebo to determine the effect of pirfenidone on mortality outcomes over 120 weeks.
Methods
We did a pooled analysis of the combined patient populations of the three global randomised phase 3 trials of pirfenidone versus placebo—Clinical Studies Assessing Pirfenidone in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis: Research of Efficacy and Safety Outcomes (CAPACITY 004 and 006; trial durations 72–120 weeks) and Assessment of Pirfenidone to Confirm Efficacy and Safety in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (ASCEND 016; 52 weeks)—for all-cause mortality, treatment-emergent all-cause mortality, idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis-related mortality, and treatment-emergent idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis-related mortality at weeks 52, 72, and 120. We also did meta-analyses of these data and data from two Japanese trials of pirfenidone versus placebo—Shionogi Phase 2 (SP2) and Shionogi Phase 3 (SP3; trial durations 36–52 weeks).
Findings
At week 52, the relative risk of death for all four mortality outcomes was significantly lower in the pirfenidone group than in the placebo group in the pooled population (all-cause mortality hazard ratio [HR] 0·52 [95% CI 0·31–0·87; p=0·0107]; treatment-emergent all-cause mortality 0·45 [0·24–0·83; 0·0094]; idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis-related mortality 0·35 [0·17–0·72; 0·0029]; treatment-emergent idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis-related mortality 0·32 [0·14–0·76; 0·0061]). Consistent with the pooled analysis, meta-analyses for all-cause mortality at week 52 also showed a clinically relevant and significant risk reduction in the pirfenidone group compared with the placebo group. Over 120 weeks, we noted significant differences in the pooled analysis favouring pirfenidone therapy compared with placebo for treatment-emergent all-cause mortality (p=0·0420), idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis-related mortality (0·0237), and treatment-emergent idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis-related (0·0132) mortality; similar results were shown by meta-analyses.
Interpretation
Several analytic approaches demonstrated that pirfenidone therapy is associated with a reduction in the relative risk of mortality compared with placebo over 120 weeks.

abstract = "Summary
Background
In May, 2016, WHO endorsed a 9 month regimen for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis that is cheaper and potentially more effective than the conventional, longer (20–24 month) therapy. We aimed to investigate the population-level implications of scaling up this new regimen.
Methods
In this population modelling analysis, we developed a dynamic transmission model to simulate the introduction of this short-course regimen as an instantaneous switch in 2016. We projected the corresponding percentage reduction in the incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis by 2024 compared with continued use of longer therapy. In the primary analysis in a representative southeast Asian setting, we assumed that the short-course regimen would double treatment access (through savings in resources or capacity) and achieve long-term efficacy at levels seen in preliminary cohort studies. We then did extensive sensitivity analyses to explore a range of alternative scenarios.
Findings
Under the optimistic assumptions in the primary analysis, the incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in 2024 would be 3·3 (95% uncertainty range 2·2–5·6) per 100 000 population with the short-course regimen and 4·3 (2·9–7·6) per 100 000 population with continued use of longer therapy—ie, the short-course regimen could reduce incidence by 23% (10–38). Incidence would be reduced by 14% (4–28) if the new regimen affected only treatment effectiveness and by 11% (3–24) if it affected only treatment availability. Under more pessimistic assumptions, the short-course regimen would have minimal effect and even potential for harm—eg, when 30% of patients are ineligible for the new regimen because of second-line drug resistance, we projected a change in incidence of −2% (−20 to +28). The new regimen's effect was greater in settings with more ongoing transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, but results were otherwise similar across settings with different levels of tuberculosis incidence and prevalence of multidrug resistance.
Interpretation
The short-course regimen has potential to substantially lessen the multidrug-resistant tuberculosis epidemic, but this effect depends on its long-term efficacy, its ability to expand treatment access, and the role of second-line drug resistance.

abstract = "Summary
Advanced emphysema is a lung disease in which alveolar capillary units are destroyed and supporting tissue is lost. The combined effect of reduced gas exchange and changes in airway dynamics impairs expiratory airflow and leads to progressive air trapping. Pharmacological therapies have limited effects. Surgical resection of the most destroyed sections of the lung can improve pulmonary function and exercise capacity but its benefit is tempered by significant morbidity. This issue stimulated a search for novel approaches to lung volume reduction. Alternative minimally invasive approaches using bronchoscopic techniques including valves, coils, vapour thermal ablation, and sclerosant agents have been at the forefront of these developments. Insertion of endobronchial valves in selected patients could have benefits that are comparable with lung volume reduction surgery. Endobronchial coils might have a role in the treatment of patients with emphysema with severe hyperinflation and less parenchymal destruction. Use of vapour thermal energy or a sclerosant might allow focal treatment but the unpredictability of the inflammatory response limits their current use. In this Review, we aim to summarise clinical trial evidence on lung volume reduction and provide guidance on patient selection for available therapies."

abstract = "Summary
Use of long-term non-invasive ventilation is increasing exponentially worldwide in children of all ages. The treatment entails delivery of ventilatory assistance through a non-invasive interface. Indications for use of non-invasive ventilation include conditions that affect normal respiratory balance (eg, those associated with dysfunction of the central drive or respiratory muscles) and disorders characterised by an increase in respiratory load (eg, obstructive airway or lung diseases). The type of non-invasive ventilation used depends on the pathophysiological features of the respiratory failure. For example, non-invasive ventilation will need to either replace central drive if the disorder is characterised by an abnormal central drive or substitute for the respiratory muscles if the condition is associated with respiratory muscle weakness. Non-invasive ventilation might also need to unload the respiratory muscles in case of an increase in respiratory load, as seen in upper airway obstruction and some lung diseases. Technical aspects are also important when choosing non-invasive ventilation—eg, appropriate interface and device. The great heterogeneity of disorders, age ranges of affected children, prognoses, and outcomes of patients needing long-term non-invasive ventilation underline the need for management by skilled multidisciplinary centres with technical competence in paediatric non-invasive ventilation and expertise in sleep studies and therapeutic education."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Inhaled corticosteroids are important in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but can slightly increase the risk of pneumonia in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. Patients with circulating eosinophil counts of 2% or more of blood leucocytes respond better to inhaled corticosteroids than do those with counts of less than 2% and it was therefore postulated that blood eosinophil count might also have an effect on the risk of pneumonia in patients with COPD. In this post-hoc meta-analysis, we investigate whether a 2% threshold can identify patients who differ in their risk of pneumonia, irrespective of inhaled corticosteroid treatment.
Methods
From the GlaxoSmithKline trial registry, we selected randomised, double-blind, clinical trials of patients with COPD that had: inhaled corticosteroid arms (fluticasone propionate and salmeterol or fluticasone furoate and vilanterol); a control arm (not given inhaled fluticasone); and pre-randomisation measurements of blood eosinophil counts and were of at least 24 weeks in duration. With use of specified terms from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities we identified pneumonia adverse events in patient-level data. We calculated number of patients with pneumonia events, stratified by baseline blood eosinophil count (<2% vs ≥2% of blood leucocytes) and whether or not patients had received inhaled corticosteroids.
Findings
We identified ten trials (conducted between 1998 and 2011), with eosinophil count data available for 10 861 patients with COPD. 4043 patients had baseline blood eosinophil counts of less than 2% and 6818 patients had baseline blood eosinophil counts of 2% or more. 149 (3·7%) patients with counts less than 2% had one or more pneumonia adverse events compared with 215 (3·2%) with counts of 2% or more (hazard ratio [HR] 1·31; 95% CI 1·06–1·62). In patients not treated with inhaled corticosteroids, 40 (3·8%) patients with less than 2% blood eosinophil counts had a pneumonia event versus 48 (2·4%) with 2% or more blood eosinophils (HR 1·53; 95% CI 1·01–2·31). In patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids, events occurred in 107 (4·5%) versus 164 (3·9%; HR 1·25; 95% CI 0·98–1·60), respectively.
Interpretation
Using 2% baseline eosinophil count as a threshold, patients with COPD with lower blood eosinophil counts had more pneumonia events than did those with higher counts. The magnitude of this increased risk was small and should be further explored in large, prospective studies. These data should be considered when making treatment decisions, alongside existing evidence that patients with COPD and baseline blood eosinophil counts less than 2% have a poorer response to inhaled corticosteroids.

We discuss competing explanations for the high prevalence of smoking in people with serious mental illness and the effectiveness of available smoking cessation interventions. We propose trials of harm reduction options, such as nicotine replacement therapy and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), as long-term substitutes for cigarettes in smokers with serious mental illness who are unable to quit smoking.

abstract = "Summary
With the recent development of two effective treatments for patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, an accurate diagnosis is crucial. The traditional approach to diagnosis emphasises the importance of thorough clinical and laboratory evaluations to exclude secondary causes of disease. High-resolution CT is a critical initial diagnostic test and acts as a tool to identify patients who should undergo surgical lung biopsy to secure a definitive histological diagnosis of usual interstitial pneumonia pattern. This diagnostic approach faces several challenges. Many patients with suspected idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis present with atypical high-resolution CT characteristics but are unfit for surgical lung biopsy, therefore preventing a confident diagnosis. The state of the art suggests an iterative, multidisciplinary process that incorporates available clinical, laboratory, imaging, and histological features. Recent research has explored genomic techniques to molecularly phenotype patients with interstitial lung disease. In the future, clinicians will probably use blood-specific or lung-specific molecular markers in combination with other clinical, physiological, and imaging features to enhance diagnostic efforts, refine prognostic recommendations, and influence the initial or subsequent treatment options. There is an urgent and increasing need for well designed, large, prospective studies measuring the effect of different diagnostic approaches. Ultimately, this will help to inform the development of guidelines and tailor clinical practice for the benefit of patients."

abstract = "Summary
Background
A large randomised treatment trial (SERVE-HF) showed that treatment of central sleep apnoea with adaptive servoventilation in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFREF) increased mortality, although the analysis of the composite primary endpoint (time to first event of death from any cause, life-saving cardiovascular intervention, or unplanned hospital admission for worsening heart failure) was neutral. This secondary multistate modelling analysis of SERVE-HF data investigated associations between adaptive servoventilation and individual components of the primary endpoint to try to better understand the mechanisms underlying the observed increased mortality.
Methods
In SERVE-HF, participants were randomly assigned to receive either optimum medical treatment for heart failure alone (control group), or in combination with adaptive servoventilation. We analysed individual components of the primary SERVE-HF endpoint separately in a multistate model, with and without three covariates suggested for effect modification (implantable cardioverter defibrillator at baseline, left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF], and proportion of Cheyne-Stokes Respiration [CSR]). The SERVE-HF study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00733343.
Findings
Univariate analysis showed an increased risk of both cardiovascular death without previous hospital admission (hazard ratio [HR] 2·59, 95% CI 1·54–4·37, p<0·001) and cardiovascular death after a life-saving event (1·57, 1·01–2·44, p=0·045) in the group receiving adaptive servoventilation versus the control group. Adjusted analysis showed that the increased risk attributed to adaptive servoventilation of cardiovascular death without previous hospital admission for worsening heart failure varied with LVEF and that the risk attributed to adaptive servoventilation of hospital admission for worsening heart failure varied with LVEF and CSR. In patients with LVEF less than or equal to 30%, use of adaptive servoventilation markedly increased the risk of cardiovascular death without previous hospital admission (HR 5·21, 95% CI 2·11–12·89, p=0·026).
Interpretation
Adaptive servoventilation is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (LVEF ≤45%) treated for predominant central sleep apnoea. This multistate modelling analysis shows that this risk is increased for cardiovascular death in patients not previously admitted to hospital, presumably due to sudden death, and in patients with poor left ventricular function.

abstract = "Summary
Asthma is the most prevalent chronic respiratory disease both in children and adults and resembles a complex syndrome rather than a single disease. Different methods have been developed to better characterise distinct asthma phenotypes in childhood and adulthood. In studies of adults, most phenotyping relies on biomaterials from the lower airways; however, this information is missing in paediatric studies because of restricted accessibility. Few patients show symptoms throughout childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Risk factors for this might be genetics, family history of asthma and atopy, infections early in life, allergic diseases, and lung function deficits. In turn, a large proportion of children with asthma lose their symptoms during school age and adolescence. This improved prognosis, which might also reflect a better treatment response, is associated with being male and with milder and less allergic disease. Importantly, whether clinical remission of symptoms equals the disappearance of underlying pathology is unknown. In fact, airway hyper-responsiveness and airway inflammation might remain despite the absence of overt symptoms. Additionally, a new-onset of asthma symptoms is apparent in adulthood, especially in women and in the case of impaired lung function. However, many patients do not remember childhood symptoms, which might reflect relapse rather than true initiation. Both relapse and adult-onset of asthma symptoms have been associated with allergic disease and sensitisation in addition to airway hyper-responsiveness. Thus, asthma symptoms beginning in adults might have originated in childhood. Equivocally, persistence into, relapse, and new-onset of symptoms in adulthood have all been related to active smoking. However, underlying mechanisms for the associations remain unclear, and future asthma research should therefore integrate standardised molecular approaches in identical ways in both paediatric and adult populations and in longitudinal studies."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Airway neutrophilic inflammation is a pathological feature in some patients with severe asthma. Stimulation of the chemokine receptor CXCR2 mediates neutrophil migration into the airways. We investigated the safety and efficacy of AZD5069, a CXCR2 antagonist, as an add-on therapy in patients with uncontrolled severe asthma.
Methods
In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding trial, we enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with uncontrolled asthma despite combination therapy with long-acting β2 agonists and medium-dose or high-dose inhaled corticosteroids. Patients were randomised in a 1:1:1:1 ratio via an interactive voice-response or web-response system to receive 5, 15, or 45 mg oral AZD5069 twice daily or matched placebo. The primary endpoint was the number of severe asthma exacerbations in 6 months. Safety was assessed in the 6-month treatment period and an optional 6-month safety extension. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01704495.
Findings
640 patients with a mean age of 52 (SD 11·8) years were randomised, 478 to receive AZD5069 (5 mg n=160, 15 mg n=156, and 45 mg n=162) and 162 placebo. No dose of AZD5069 reduced the rate of severe exacerbations compared with placebo (rate ratio for 5 mg 1·29, 90% CI 0·79–2·11; for 15 mg 1·53, 0·95–2·46; and for 45 mg 1·56, 0·98–2·49). Treatment with AZD5069 was generally well tolerated. The most commonly reported adverse event overall was nasopharyngitis, seen in 18 (11·5%) receiving 5 mg, 13 (8·5%) receiving 15 mg, and 18 (11·2%) receiving 45 mg AZD5069, and 31 (19·5%) of those receiving placebo.
Interpretation
Treatment with this selective CXCR2 antagonist did not reduce the frequency of severe exacerbations in patients with uncontrolled severe asthma. These findings bring into question the role of CXCR2-mediated neutrophil recruitment in the pathobiology of exacerbations in severe refractory asthma.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) catalyses collagen cross-linking and is implicated in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of simtuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against LOXL2, in patients with IPF.
Methods
In this randomised, double-blind, phase 2 trial, we recruited patients aged 45–85 years with definite IPF diagnosed prior to 3 years of screening from 183 hospitals and respiratory clinics in 14 countries. Eligible patients, stratified by baseline forced vital capacity (FVC), serum LOXL2 (sLOXL2) concentrations, and pirfenidone and nintedanib use, were randomly assigned (1:1) to inject 125 mg/mL simtuzumab or placebo subcutaneously once a week. The primary endpoints were progression-free survival, defined as time to all-cause death or a categorical decrease from baseline in FVC % predicted, in the intention-to-treat population, in patients with sLOXL2 concentrations in the 50th percentile or higher, and in patients with sLOXL2 concentrations in the 75th percentile or higher. Treatment duration was event-driven, and interim analyses were planned and conducted after approximately 120 and 200 progression-free survival events, respectively, occurred. We compared treatment groups with the stratified log-rank test. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01769196.
Findings
Patients with IPF were recruited between Jan 31, 2013, and June 1, 2015. The intention-to-treat population included 544 randomly assigned patients (272 patients in both groups), and the safety population included 543 randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study medication. The study was terminated when the second interim analysis met the prespecified futility stopping criteria in the intention-to-treat population. We noted no difference in progression-free survival between simtuzumab and placebo in the intention-to-treat population (median progression free survival times of 12·6 months and 15·4 months for simtuzumab and placebo, respectively; stratified HR 1·13, 95% CI 0·88–1·45; p=0·329) and in patients with baseline sLOXL2 in the 50th percentile or higher (median progression-free survival 11·7 months and 14·3 months for simtuzumab and placebo, respectively; stratified HR 1·03, 95% CI 0·74–1·43; p=0·851), or in the 75th percentile or higher (median progression-free survival 11·6 months and 16·9 months for simtuzumab and placebo, respectively; stratified HR 1·20, 95% CI 0·72–2·00; p=0·475). The incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events was similar between treatment groups. The most common adverse events in both the simtuzumab and placebo groups were dyspnoea, cough, upper respiratory tract infection, and worsening of IPF; and the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were worsening of IPF, dyspnoea, and pneumonia.
Interpretation
Simtuzumab did not improve progression-free survival in a well-defined population of patients with IPF. Our data do not support the use of simtuzumab for patients with IPF.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The emergence of programmatically incurable tuberculosis threatens to destabilise control efforts. The aim of this study was to collect prospective patient-level data to inform treatment and containment strategies.
Methods
In a prospective cohort study, 273 South African patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, or resistance beyond extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, were followed up over a period of 6 years. Transmission dynamics, infectiousness, and drug susceptibility were analysed in a subset of patients from the Western Cape using whole-genome sequencing (WGS; n=149), a cough aerosol sampling system (CASS; n=26), and phenotypic testing for 18 drugs (n=179).
Findings
Between Oct 1, 2008, and Oct 31, 2012, we enrolled and followed up 273 patients for a median of 20·3 months (IQR 9·6–27·8). 203 (74%) had programmatically incurable tuberculosis and unfavourable outcomes (treatment failure, relapse, default, or death despite treatment with a regimen based on capreomycin, aminosalicylic acid, or both). 172 (63%) patients were discharged home, of whom 104 (60%) had an unfavourable outcome. 54 (31%) home-discharged patients had failed treatment, with a median time to death after discharge of 9·9 months (IQR 4·2–17·4). 35 (20%) home-discharged cases were smear-positive at discharge. Using CASS, six (23%) of 26 home-discharged cases with data available expectorated infectious culture-positive cough aerosols in the respirable range (<5 μm), and most reported inter-person contact with suboptimal protective mask usage. WGS identified 17 (19%) of the 90 patients (with available sequence data) that were discharged home before the diagnosis of 20 downstream cases of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis with almost identical sequencing profiles suggestive of community-based transmission (five or fewer single nucleotide polymorphisms different and with identical resistance-encoding mutations for 14 drugs). 11 (55%) of these downstream cases had HIV co-infection and ten (50%) had died by the end of the study. 22 (56%) of 39 isolates in patients discharged home after treatment failure were resistant to eight or more drugs. However, five (16%) of 31 isolates were susceptible to rifabutin and more than 90% were likely to be sensitive to linezolid, bedaquiline, and delamanid.
Interpretation
More than half of the patients with programmatically incurable tuberculosis were discharged into the community where they remained for an average of 16 months, were at risk of expectorating infectious cough aerosols, and posed a threat of transmission of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. Urgent action, including appropriate containment strategies, is needed to address this situation. Access to delamanid, bedaquiline, linezolid, and rifabutin, when appropriate, must be accelerated along with comprehensive drug susceptibility testing.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Ex-vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) can be used to extend overall lung preservation time by splitting one long cold ischaemic time into two shorter ones and interposing an additional EVLP time. We assessed the outcomes after clinical transplantation of lungs with more than 12 h of preservation time.
Methods
For this retrospective study, we searched the Toronto Lung Transplant Program database for patients who had received at least one lung transplant between Jan 1, 2006, and April 30, 2015, at a single hospital in Toronto, Canada. We split the identified patients into those with a total preservation time of more than 12 h and those with a total preservation time of less than 12 h to act as the control group. Total preservation time was defined as the sum of first cold ischaemic time, EVLP time, and second cold ischaemic time. We excluded patients if they had received a heart–lung transplant or were younger than 18 years. In bilateral lung transplantations, we used the longer preservation time of the two lungs for analysis. Lung preservation was done according to present standards of care and EVLP was done according to the Toronto EVLP technique. The primary outcomes were survival and International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Primary Graft Dysfunction (PGD) grade at 72 h post-transplantation. We compared outcomes with our control group using univariable and multivariable models.
Findings
We identified 906 patients who met eligibility criteria and had sufficient data for analysis (<12 h group [n=809]; mean lung preservation time 400·8 min [SD 121·8] vs >12 h group [n=97]; 875·7 min [109·0]). Median hospital and intensive-care unit length of stay were similar between the less than 12 h group and the more than 12 h group (hospital stay: 23 days [16–42] vs 25·5 days [17–50·25], p=0·60; intensive-care unit stay: 4 days [2–14] vs 4 days [2–16], p=0·53). PGD grade was also not different between the two groups at 72 h post-transplantation (p=0·85). There was also no difference in survival between the two groups as shown on Kaplan-Meier survival curves (p=0·61). Multivariable survival analysis using Cox's model showed increasing recipient age to be a significant variable affecting survival.
Interpretation
Extension of graft preservation time beyond 12 h with EVLP does not negatively affect early lung transplantation outcomes. Extension of clinical lung preservation times might allow for more transplantations to be done as a result of improved facilitation and increased flexibility around timing of lung transplantation operations.

abstract = "Summary
Background
In phase 2 trials, lebrikizumab, an anti-interleukin-13 monoclonal antibody, reduced exacerbation rates and improved FEV1 in patients with uncontrolled asthma, particularly in those with high concentrations of type 2 biomarkers (eg, periostin or blood eosinophils). We undertook replicate phase 3 studies to assess the efficacy and safety of lebrikizumab in patients with uncontrolled asthma despite inhaled corticosteroids and at least one second controller medication.
Methods
Adult patients with uncontrolled asthma, pre-bronchodilator FEV1 40–80% predicted, and stable background therapy were randomly assigned (1:1:1) with an interactive voice–web-based response system to receive lebrikizumab 37·5 mg or 125 mg, or placebo subcutaneously, once every 4 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by screening serum periostin concentration, history of asthma exacerbations within the last 12 months, baseline asthma medications, and country. The primary efficacy endpoint was the rate of asthma exacerbations over 52 weeks in biomarker-high patients (periostin ≥50 ng/mL or blood eosinophils ≥300 cells per μL), analysed with a Poisson regression model corrected for overdispersion with Pearson χ2 that included terms for treatment group, number of asthma exacerbations within the 12 months before study entry, baseline asthma medications, geographic region, screening periostin concentration, and blood eosinophil counts as covariates. Both trials are registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, LAVOLTA I, number NCT01867125, and LAVOLTA II, number NCT01868061.
Findings
1081 patients were treated in LAVOLTA I and 1067 patients in LAVOLTA II. Over 52 weeks, lebrikizumab reduced exacerbation rates in biomarker-high patients in the 37·5 mg dose group (rate ratio [RR] 0·49 [95% CI 0·34–0·69], p<0·0001) and in the 125 mg dose group (RR 0·70 [0·51–0·95], p=0·0232) versus placebo in LAVOLTA I. Exacerbation rates were also reduced in biomarker-high patients in both dose groups versus placebo in LAVOLTA II (37·5 mg: RR 0·74 [95% CI 0·54–1·01], p=0·0609; 125 mg: RR 0·74 [0·54–1·02], p=0·0626). Pooling both studies, the proportion of patients who experienced treatment-emergent adverse events (79% [1125 of 1432 patients] for both lebrikizumab doses vs 80% [576 of 716 patients] for placebo), serious adverse events (8% [115 patients] for both lebrikizumab doses vs 9% [65 patients] for placebo), and adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation (3% [49 patients] for both lebrikizumab doses vs 4% [31 patients] for placebo) were similar between lebrikizumab and placebo. The following serious adverse events were reported in the placebo-controlled period: one event of aplastic anaemia and five serious adverse events related to raised concentrations of eosinophils in patients treated with lebrikizumab and one event of eosinophilic pneumonia in the placebo group.
Interpretation
Lebrikizumab did not consistently show significant reduction in asthma exacerbations in biomarker-high patients. However, it blocked interleukin-13 as evidenced by the effect on interleukin-13-related pharmacodynamic biomarkers, and clinically relevant changes could not be ruled out.

abstract = "Summary
Background
In treatment-naive patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, initial combination therapy with ambrisentan and tadalafil reduces the risk of clinical failure events compared with monotherapy. We did this secondary analysis to further investigate the effect of combination therapy on survival.
Methods
We analysed survival data from the modified intention-to-treat population of the Ambrisentan and Tadalafil in Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (AMBITION) trial. AMBITION was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind study, in which treatment-naive patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension were randomly assigned in a 2:1:1 ratio and received combination therapy with ambrisentan and tadalafil, ambrisentan and placebo, or tadalafil and placebo. We did a prespecified analysis of all mortality events from randomisation to the end of the study, including patients who discontinued their assigned treatment. In a post-hoc analysis, we analysed survival at 7 days after the termination of each individual patient's randomised treatment. We used Cox proportional hazard regression, Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, and the stratified log-rank test to compare the survival of patients receiving initial combination therapy or initial monotherapy.
Findings
The study population consisted of 605 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension who were randomly assigned and received combination therapy (n=302) or monotherapy (n=303; 152 patients assigned to ambrisentan monotherapy and 151 patients to tadalafil monotherapy). At the end of the study, 29 (10%) of 302 patients in the combination therapy group had died compared with 41 (14%) of 303 patients in the monotherapy group (hazard ratio 0·67, 95% CI 0·42–1·08; stratified log-rank p=0·10). At 7 days after the end of randomised treatment, fewer patients had died in the combination therapy group (3 [1%] of 302 patients) compared with the monotherapy group (13 [4%] of 303 patients; hazard ratio 0·21, 95% CI 0·06–0·73).
Interpretation
These data indicate that initial combination therapy might be associated with a survival advantage compared with initial monotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary arterial hypertension. This hypothesis needs to be addressed in future studies.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Observational data have been conflicted regarding the potential role of HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) as a causative factor for, or protective factor against, COPD. We therefore aimed to investigate the effect of immediate versus deferred ART on decline in lung function in HIV-positive individuals.
Methods
We did a nested substudy within the randomised, controlled Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral Treatment (START) trial at 80 sites in multiple settings in 20 high-income and low-to-middle-income countries. Participants were HIV-1 infected individuals aged at least 25 years, naive to ART, with CD4 T-cell counts of more than 500 per μL, not receiving treatment for asthma, and without recent respiratory infections (baseline COPD was not an exclusion criterion). Participants were randomly assigned to receive ART (an approved drug combination derived from US Department of Health and Human Services guidelines) either immediately, or deferred until CD4 T-cell counts decreased to 350 per μL or AIDS developed. The randomisation was determined by participation in the parent START study, and was not specific to the substudy. Because of the nature of our study, site investigators and participants were not masked to the treatment group assignment; however, the assessors who reviewed the outcomes were masked to the treatment group. The primary outcome was the annual rate of decline in lung function, expressed as the FEV1 slope in mL/year; spirometry was done annually during follow-up for up to 5 years. We analysed data on an intention-to-treat basis, and planned separate analyses in smokers and non-smokers because of the known effects of smoking on FEV1 decline. The substudy was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01797367.
Findings
Between March 11, 2010, and Aug 23, 2013, we enrolled 1026 participants to our substudy, who were then randomly assigned to either immediate (n=518) or deferred (n=508) ART. Median baseline characteristics included age 36 years (IQR 30–44), CD4 T-cell count 648 per μL (583–767), and HIV plasma viral load 4·2 log10 copies per mL (3·5–4·7). 29% were female and 28% were current smokers. Median follow-up time was 2·0 years (IQR 1·9–3·0). We noted no differences in FEV1 slopes between the immediate and deferred ART groups either in smokers (difference of −3·3 mL/year, 95% CI −38·8 to 32·2; p=0·86) or in non-smokers (difference of −5·6 mL/year, −29·4 to 18·3; p=0·65) or in pooled analyses adjusted for smoking status at each study visit (difference of −5·2 mL/year, −25·1 to 14·6; p=0·61).
Interpretation
The timing of ART initiation has no major short-term effect on rate of lung function decline in HIV-positive individuals who are naive to ART, with CD4 T-cell counts of more than 500 per μL. In light of updated WHO recommendations that all HIV-positive individuals should be treated with ART, regardless of their CD4 T-cell count, our results suggest an absence of significant pulmonary harm with such an approach.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The management of paediatric asthma exacerbations is based on trials in children of all ages. Recent studies from 2009 raised the possibility that preschoolers (younger than 6 years) with viral-induced wheezing and children exposed to tobacco smoke might be at an increased risk of treatment failure. The study objective was to identify factors associated with management failure in children presenting to the emergency department with moderate or severe asthma exacerbations.
Methods
We undertook a prospective, multicentre cohort study of children aged 1–17 years presenting to five emergency departments with moderate or severe asthma (defined as a Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure [PRAM] of 4 to 12). Children received oral corticosteroids and severity-specific inhaled bronchodilator therapy. The primary outcome was emergency department management failure (hospital admission, prolonged emergency department therapy [≥8 h], or relapse within 72 h of discharge from the emergency department with admission to hospital or prolonged emergency department stay). Viral cause was ascertained by PCR on nasopharyngeal specimens and environmental tobacco smoke exposure by salivary cotinine concentration. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02013076).
Findings
Between Feb 14, 2011, and Dec 20, 2013, we screened 1893 children and enrolled 1012 eligible children. Of those eligible children, 973 participants were included in the analysis. 165 (17%) of 965 children experienced management failure in the emergency department, which was significantly associated with viral detection (110 [19%] of 579 participants with virus detection vs 46 [13%] of 354 participants without viral detection, odds ratio [OR] 1·57; 95% CI 1·04–2·37), fever (24% vs 15%, 1·96; 1·32–2·92), baseline PRAM (OR 1·38 per 1-point increase; 1·22–1·56), oxygen saturation of less than 92% (50% vs 12%, 3·94; 1·97–7·89), and presence of symptoms between exacerbations (21% vs 16%, 1·73; 1·13–2·64). Age, salivary cotinine concentration, and oral corticosteroids dose were not significantly associated with management failure. Viral detection (67% vs 46%, p<0·0001) and fever (31% vs 16%, p<0·0001) occurred more frequently in preschoolers than in older children. Viral detection was also associated with reduced speed of recovery over the 10 days after discharge.
Interpretation
In children presenting with moderate or severe asthma, viral detection, but not age, was associated with failure of symptom management, independently from exacerbation severity (ie, baseline PRAM and oxygen saturation), fever, and symptom chronicity (viral detection). Although it did not reach statistical significance, the association between treatment management failure and exposure to tobacco smoke warrants further investigation.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Hydroxyethyl starch for fluid resuscitation in critically ill patients is not associated with improved short-term patient-centred outcomes compared with crystalloid fluid solutions. However, its effect on longer term health economic outcomes has not been reported.
Methods
We did a prespecified cost-effectiveness analysis of a cohort of patients from New South Wales enrolled in the Crystalloid versus Hydroxyethyl Starch Trial (CHEST), who were randomised to treatment with either 6% hydroxyethyl starch with a molecular weight of 130 kD and a molar substitution ratio of 0·4 or 0·9% sodium chloride (saline) for fluid resuscitation. Clinical outcomes were mortality and life-years gained at 6 months and 24 months, health-related quality of life at 6 months, and quality-adjusted life-years gained at 6 months. Health economic outcomes were hospital and intensive-care unit (ICU) resource use and costs at 24 months and cost-effectiveness, which we defined as the probability of reaching a willingness-to-pay threshold of less than A$50 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained at 6 months and $100 000 per life-year gained at 24 months. CHEST is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00935168.
Findings
3537 (51%) of 7000 patients were enrolled into CHEST from New South Wales, of whom 3450 (98%) were included in our cost-effectiveness analysis. Mortality at both 6 months and 24 months did not differ between the hydroxyethyl starch and saline groups (6 months: 397/1684 [24%] vs 382/1706 [22%]; relative risk [RR] 1·05, 95% CI 0·93–1·19; p=0·41; 24 months: 586/1687 [35%] vs 594/1708 [35%]; RR 1·00, 95% CI 0·91–1·10; p=0·89). The mean number of life-years gained at 6 months and 24 months was similar between the hydroxyethyl starch and saline groups (6 months: 0·41 days [SD 0·18] vs 0·41 days [0·17]; p=0·25; 24 months: 1·46 years [SD 0·80] vs 1·47 years [0·79]; p=0·72). At 6 months, the mean health-related quality of life score was 0·67 (SD 0·34) with hydroxyethyl starch versus 0·69 (0·35) with saline (p=0·33). The mean number of quality-adjusted life-years gained did not differ between the hydroxyethyl starch and saline groups at 6 months (0·26 days [SD 0·18] vs 0·26 days [0·18]; p=0·33). Total hospital costs (including ICU costs) at 24 months were similar between the hydroxyethyl starch and saline groups (A$62 196 [55 935] vs $62 617 [56 452]; p=0·83). The probability that hydroxyethyl starch was cost effective was 11% at 6 months and 29% at 24 months.
Interpretation
Although longer term clinical outcomes did not differ between patients resuscitated with hydroxyethyl starch or saline in the ICU, from a health-care payer's perspective, the probability that hydroxyethyl starch is cost effective in these patients is low.

abstract = "Summary
Background
RET rearrangements are rare oncogenic alterations in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Vandetanib is a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor exhibiting RET kinase activity. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of vandetanib in patients with advanced RET-rearranged NSCLC.
Methods
In this open-label, multicentre, phase 2 trial (LURET), patients with advanced RET-rearranged NSCLC continuously received 300 mg of oral vandetanib daily. RET-positive patients were screened using a nationwide genomic screening network of about 200 participating institutions. Primary endpoint was the independently assessed objective response in eligible patients. This study is registered with UMIN-CTR, number UMIN000010095.
Findings
Between Feb 7, 2013, and March 19, 2015, 1536 patients with EGFR mutation-negative NSCLC were screened, of whom 34 were RET-positive (2%) and 19 were enrolled. Among 17 eligible patients included in primary analysis, nine (53% [95% CI 28–77]) achieved an objective response, which met the primary endpoint. In the intention-to-treat population of all 19 patients treated with vandetanib, nine (47% [95% CI 24–71]) achieved an objective response. At the data cutoff, median progression-free survival was 4·7 months (95% CI 2·8–8·5). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were hypertension (11 [58%]), diarrhoea (two [11%]), rash (three [16%]), dry skin (one [5%]), and QT prolongation (two [11%]).
Interpretation
Vandetanib showed clinical antitumour activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with advanced RET-rearranged NSCLC. Our results define RET rearrangement as a new molecular subgroup of NSCLC suitable for targeted therapy.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The 24-week safety and efficacy of lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination therapy was shown in two randomised controlled trials (RCTs)—TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT—in patients with cystic fibrosis who were aged 12 years or older and homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. We aimed to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of extended lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy in this group of patients in PROGRESS, the long-term extension of TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT.
Methods
PROGRESS was a phase 3, parallel-group, multicentre, 96-week study of patients who completed TRAFFIC or TRANSPORT in 191 sites in 15 countries. Patients were eligible if they were at least 12 years old with cystic fibrosis and homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. Exclusion criteria included any comorbidity or laboratory abnormality that, in the opinion of the investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose an additional risk in administering the study drug to the participant, history of drug intolerance, and history of poor compliance with the study drug. Patients who previously received active treatment in TRANSPORT or TRAFFIC remained on the same dose in PROGRESS. Patients who had received placebo in TRANSPORT or TRAFFIC were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive lumacaftor (400 mg every 12 h)/ivacaftor (250 mg every 12 h) or lumacaftor (600 mg once daily)/ivacaftor (250 mg every 12 h). The primary outcome was to assess the long-term safety of combined therapy. The estimated annual rate of decline in percent predicted FEV1 (ppFEV1) in treated patients was compared with that of a matched registry cohort. Efficacy analyses were based on modified intention-to-treat, such that data were included for all patients who were randomly assigned and received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01931839.
Findings
Between Oct 24, 2013, and April 7, 2016, 1030 patients from the TRANSPORT and TRAFFIC studies enrolled in PROGRESS, and 1029 received at least one dose of study drug. 340 patients continued treatment with lumacaftor 400 mg every 12 h/ivacaftor 250 mg every 12 h; 176 patients who had received placebo in the TRANSPORT or TRAFFIC studies initiated treatment with lumacaftor 400 mg every 12 h/ivacaftor 250 mg every 12 h, the commercially available dose, for which data are presented. The most common adverse events were infective pulmonary exacerbations, cough, increased sputum, and haemoptysis. Modest blood pressure increases seen in TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT were also observed in PROGRESS. For patients continuing treatment, the mean change from baseline in ppFEV1 was 0·5 (95% CI −0·4 to 1·5) at extension week 72 and 0·5 (−0·7 to 1·6) at extension week 96; change in BMI was 0·69 (0·56 to 0·81) at extension week 72 and 0·96 (0·81 to 1·11) at extension week 96. The annualised pulmonary exacerbation rate in patients continuing treatment through extension week 96 (0·65, 0·56 to 0·75) remained lower than the placebo rate in TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT. The annualised rate of ppFEV1 decline was reduced in lumacaftor/ivacaftor-treated patients compared with matched controls (−1·33, −1·80 to −0·85 vs −2·29, −2·56 to −2·03). The efficacy and safety profile of the lumacaftor 600 mg once daily/ivacaftor 250 mg every 12 h groups was generally similar to that of the lumacaftor 400 mg every 12 h/ivacaftor 250 mg every 12 h groups.
Interpretation
The long-term safety profile of lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination therapy was consistent with previous RCTs. Benefits continued to be observed with longer-term treatment, and lumacaftor/ivacaftor was associated with a 42% slower rate of ppFEV1 decline than in matched registry controls.

abstract = "Summary
Background
There is insufficient research into the use of mechanical ventilation with increased inspiratory oxygen concentration (FiO2) and fluid resuscitation with hypertonic saline solution in patients with septic shock. We tested whether these interventions are associated with reduced mortality.
Methods
This two-by-two factorial, multicentre, randomised, clinical trial (HYPERS2S) recruited patients aged 18 years and older with septic shock who were on mechanical ventilation from 22 centres in France. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1:1 to four groups by a computer generated randomisation list stratified by site and presence or absence of acute respiratory distress syndrome by use of permuted blocks of random sizes. Patients received, in an open-labelled manner, mechanical ventilation either with FiO2 at 1·0 (hyperoxia) or FiO2 set to target an arterial haemoglobin oxygen saturation of 88–95% (normoxia) during the first 24 h; patients also received, in a double-blind manner, either 280 mL boluses of 3·0% (hypertonic) saline or 0·9% (isotonic) saline for fluid resuscitation during the first 72 h. The primary endpoint was mortality at day 28 after randomisation in the intention-to-treat population. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01722422.
Findings
Between Nov 3, 2012, and June 13, 2014, 442 patients were recruited and assigned to a treatment group (normoxia [n=223] or hyperoxia [n=219]; isotonic [n=224] or hypertonic [n=218]). The trial was stopped prematurely for safety reasons. 28 day mortality was recorded for 434 patients; 93 (43%) of 217 patients had died in the hyperoxia group versus 77 (35%) of 217 patients in the normoxia group (hazard ratio [HR] 1·27, 95% CI 0·94–1·72; p=0·12). 89 (42%) of 214 patients had died in the hypertonic group versus 81 (37%) of 220 patients in the isotonic group (HR 1·19, 0·88–1·61; p=0·25). We found a significant difference in the overall incidence of serious adverse events between the hyperoxia (185 [85%]) and normoxia groups (165 [76%]; p=0·02), with a clinically relevant doubling in the hyperoxia group of the number of patients with intensive care unit-acquired weakness (24 [11%] vs 13 [6%]; p=0·06) and atelectasis (26 [12%] vs 13 [6%]; p=0·04) compared with the normoxia group. We found no statistical difference for serious adverse events between the two saline groups (p=0·23).
Interpretation
In patients with septic shock, setting FiO2 to 1·0 to induce arterial hyperoxia might increase the risk of mortality. Hypertonic (3%) saline did not improve survival.

Pulmonary toxicity of cancer immunotherapies has emerged as an important clinical event that requires prompt identification and management. Although often referred to as pneumonitis, pulmonary toxicity associated with immunotherapy covers a broad and overlapping spectrum of pulmonary manifestations, and, once suspected, the range of differential diagnoses of infectious and neoplastic processes might make the diagnostic process challenging for physicians. Optimal care can require multidisciplinary effort by pulmonologists, medical oncologists, and radiologists, and awareness of the possibility of treatment-induced pulmonary toxicity by emergency department and primary care physicians. This Viewpoint gives an overview of the diagnosis and management of pulmonary toxicity arising from cancer immunotherapy, including widely used treatments, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, and emerging therapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor T cells."

abstract = "Summary
Glucocorticoids have been used as adjunctive therapy in patients with sepsis and septic shock for more than four decades. The rationale for the use of glucocorticoids is that this class of drugs downregulates the proinflammatory response and limits the anti-inflammatory response while preserving innate immunity. Between 1976 and 2017, 22 randomised placebo-controlled trials have been published evaluating the benefit of glucocorticoids in patients with community-acquired pneumonia, sepsis, and septic shock. These studies produced conflicting results. In 2018, two large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were published evaluating the role of hydrocortisone in patients with septic shock. The Activated Protein C and Corticosteroids for Human Septic Shock (APROCCHSS) trial reported a reduction in 90-day mortality whereas the Adjunctive Corticosteroid Treatment in Critically Ill Patients with Septic Shock (ADRENAL) trial reported no mortality benefit. This Viewpoint critically appraises these two RCTs and evaluates the use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of sepsis and septic shock in the modern era."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Diffuse parenchymal lung disease represents a diverse and challenging group of pulmonary disorders. A consistent diagnostic approach to diffuse parenchymal lung disease is crucial if clinical trial data are to be applied to individual patients. We aimed to evaluate inter-multidisciplinary team agreement for the diagnosis of diffuse parenchymal lung disease.
Methods
We did a multicentre evaluation of clinical data of patients who presented to the interstitial lung disease unit of the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust (London, UK; host institution) and required multidisciplinary team meeting (MDTM) characterisation between March 1, 2010, and Aug 31, 2010. Only patients whose baseline clinical, radiological, and, if biopsy was taken, pathological data were undertaken at the host institution were included. Seven MDTMs, consisting of at least one clinician, radiologist, and pathologist, from seven countries (Denmark, France, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Portugal, and the UK) evaluated cases of diffuse parenchymal lung disease in a two-stage process between Jan 1, and Oct 15, 2015. First, the clinician, radiologist, and pathologist (if lung biopsy was completed) independently evaluated each case, selected up to five differential diagnoses from a choice of diffuse lung diseases, and chose likelihoods (censored at 5% and summing to 100% in each case) for each of their differential diagnoses, without inter-disciplinary consultation. Second, these specialists convened at an MDTM and reviewed all data, selected up to five differential diagnoses, and chose diagnosis likelihoods. We compared inter-observer and inter-MDTM agreements on patient first-choice diagnoses using Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ). We then estimated inter-observer and inter-MDTM agreement on the probability of diagnosis using weighted kappa coefficient (κw). We compared inter-observer and inter-MDTM confidence of patient first-choice diagnosis. Finally, we evaluated the prognostic significance of a first-choice diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) versus not IPF for MDTMs, clinicians, and radiologists, using univariate Cox regression analysis.
Findings
70 patients were included in the final study cohort. Clinicians, radiologists, pathologists, and the MDTMs assigned their patient diagnoses between Jan 1, and Oct 15, 2015. IPF made up 88 (18%) of all 490 MDTM first-choice diagnoses. Inter-MDTM agreement for first-choice diagnoses overall was moderate (κ=0·50). Inter-MDTM agreement on diagnostic likelihoods was good for IPF (κw=0·71 [IQR 0·64–0·77]) and connective tissue disease-related interstitial lung disease (κw=0·73 [0·68–0·78]); moderate for non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP; κw=0·42 [0·37–0·49]); and fair for hypersensitivity pneumonitis (κw=0·29 [0·24–0·40]). High-confidence diagnoses (>65% likelihood) of IPF were given in 68 (77%) of 88 cases by MDTMs, 62 (65%) of 96 cases by clinicians, and in 57 (66%) of 86 cases by radiologists. Greater prognostic separation was shown for an MDTM diagnosis of IPF than compared with individual clinician's diagnosis of this disease in five of seven MDTMs, and radiologist's diagnosis of IPF in four of seven MDTMs.
Interpretation
Agreement between MDTMs for diagnosis in diffuse lung disease is acceptable and good for a diagnosis of IPF, as validated by the non-significant greater prognostic separation of an IPF diagnosis made by MDTMs than the separation of a diagnosis made by individual clinicians or radiologists. Furthermore, MDTMs made the diagnosis of IPF with higher confidence and more frequently than did clinicians or radiologists. This difference is of particular importance, because accurate and consistent diagnoses of IPF are needed if clinical outcomes are to be optimised. Inter-multidisciplinary team agreement for a diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis is low, highlighting an urgent need for standardised diagnostic guidelines for this disease.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a rare, debilitating, and life-threatening disease. We investigated associations between markers of disease severity and long-term outcomes in patients with inoperable CTEPH or persistent or recurrent pulmonary hypertension after pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) who were receiving the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator riociguat. We also present safety and efficacy from the final data cutoff of CHEST-2, where most patients had received riociguat for at least 2 years.
Methods
Eligible patients from the CHEST-1 study entered the CHEST-2 open-label extension study, in which all patients received riociguat individually adjusted to a maximum dose of 2·5 mg three times per day. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability. We did exploratory assessments of associations between markers of disease severity (6-min walking distance [6MWD], N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP] concentration, and WHO functional class) at baseline and follow-up with overall survival and clinical worsening-free survival. We used Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards analyses. CHEST-2 is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00910429.
Findings
237 patients entered CHEST-2. At 2 years, overall survival was 93% (95% CI 89–96) and clinical worsening-free survival was 82% (77–87). A significant association with overall survival was seen for 6MWD and NT-proBNP concentration at baseline (p=0·0199 and p=0·0183, respectively) and at follow-up (p=0·0385 and p=0·0068, respectively). Change from baseline in 6MWD was also significantly associated with survival (p=0·0047). WHO functional class at baseline and follow-up showed no significant association with overall survival but was associated with clinical worsening-free survival. Riociguat was well tolerated by most patients and no new safety signals were identified. Serious adverse events were seen in 129 (54%) of 237 patients, and 14 (6%) discontinued riociguat therapy because of adverse events.
Interpretation
Riociguat may be used long term in patients with CTEPH. 6MWD and NT-proBNP concentration are good prognostic markers.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Blood eosinophil counts might predict response to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a history of exacerbations. We used data from the WISDOM trial to assess whether patients with COPD with higher blood eosinophil counts would be more likely to have exacerbations if ICS treatment was withdrawn.
Methods
WISDOM was a 12-month, randomised, parallel-group trial in which patients received 18 μg tiotropium, 100 μg salmeterol, and 1000 μg fluticasone propionate daily for 6 weeks and were then randomly assigned (1:1) electronically to receive either continued or reduced ICS over 12 weeks. We did a post-hoc analysis after complete ICS withdrawal (months 3–12) to compare rate of exacerbations and time to exacerbation outcomes on the basis of blood eosinophil subgroups of increasing cutoff levels. The WISDOM trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00975195.

In the 2296 patients receiving treatment after ICS withdrawal, moderate or severe exacerbation rate was higher in the ICS-withdrawal group versus the ICS-continuation group in patients with eosinophil counts (out of total white blood cell count) of 2% or greater (rate ratio 1·22 [95% CI 1·02–1·48]), 4% or greater (1·63 [1·19–2·24]), and 5% or greater (1·82 [1·20–2·76]). The increase in exacerbation rate became more pronounced as the eosinophil cutoff level rose, with significant treatment-by-subgroup interaction reached for 4% and 5% only. Similar results were seen with eosinophil cutoffs of 300 cells per μL and 400 cells per μL, and mutually exclusive subgroups.
Interpretation
Blood eosinophil counts at screening were related to the exacerbation rate after complete ICS withdrawal in patients with severe to very severe COPD and a history of exacerbations. Our data suggest that counts of 4% or greater or 300 cells per μL or more might identify a deleterious effect of ICS withdrawal, an effect not seen in most patients with eosinophil counts below these thresholds.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is a potential risk factor for the development and progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We aimed to investigate the effect of antacid therapy on disease progression in patients randomly assigned to placebo through analysis of three large, phase 3 trials of pirfenidone in IPF.
Methods
Patients with IPF from the placebo groups of three trials of pirfenidone (CAPACITY 004, CAPACITY 006, and ASCEND) were included in this post-hoc analysis. We analysed effects of antacid therapy use from baseline for pulmonary function, exercise tolerance, survival, hospital admission, and adverse events for 52 weeks with and without adjustment for potential confounders. The primary endpoint, disease progression by 1 year, was defined as a decrease in predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) by 10% or more, a decrease in 6 min walk distance (6MWD) by 50 m or more, or death. We did survival analyses with the Kaplan-Meier estimator and evaluated using the log-rank test.
Findings
Of 624 patients, 291 (47%) received antacid therapy and 333 (53%) did not. At 52 weeks, we noted no significant difference between groups for disease progression (114 [39%] for antacid therapy vs 141 [42%] for no antacid therapy, p=0·4844). Rates also did not differ for all-cause mortality (20 [7%] vs 22 [7%], p=0·8947), IPF-related mortality (11 [4%] vs 17 [5%]; p=0·4251), absolute FVC decrease by 10% or more (49 [17%] vs 64 [19%]; p=0·4411), or mean observed change in FVC (% predicted −4·9% [SD 6·4] vs −5·5% [7·2], p=0·3355; observed volume −0·2 L [0·3] vs −0·2 L [0·3], p=0·4238). The rate of hospital admission was non-significantly higher in the antacid therapy group (65 [22%] vs 54 [16%]; p=0·0522). When stratified by baseline FVC (<70% or ≥70%), disease progression, mortality, FVC, 6MWD, and hospital admission did not differ between groups. Adverse events were similar between treatment and no treatment groups; however, overall infections (107 [74%] vs 101 [62%]; p=0·0174) and pulmonary infections (20 [14%] vs 10 [6%]; p=0·0214) were higher in patients with advanced IPF (ie, FVC <70%) who were treated with antacids than not treated with antacids.
Interpretation
Antacid therapy did not improve outcomes in patients with IPF and might potentially be associated with an increased risk of infection in those with advanced disease.

Although a small proportion of patients with asthma have severe disease, it accounts for the majority of morbidity related to the illness. Severe asthma comprises a heterogeneous group of phenotypes. Targeted treatments for these phenotypes represent a major advancement in the management of severe asthma. Omalizumab, a monoclonal antibody to IgE, improves asthma control in patients with a predominant allergic phenotype. Monoclonal antibodies targeted to interleukin 4α and interleukin 5 have shown substantial benefit in patients with the eosinophilic asthma phenotype; so too have monoclonal antibodies targeted to interleukin 13 in patients with a type 2 allergic phenotype. Bronchial thermoplasty, a new technique to reduce airway smooth muscle mass, improves symptoms and reduces exacerbations in patients with severe uncontrolled asthma and the chronic airflow obstruction phenotype. While awaiting comparative trials, we can now use a targeted approach with these phenotypes, guiding our treatment selection with the best evidence. This Review will focus on the latest developments in these new treatments and inform the clinician on how to select the appropriate patient for these treatments."

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, irreversible, and typically fatal lung disease characterised by subpleural fibrosis, subepithelial fibroblast foci, and microscopic honeycombing. Although understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms continues to evolve, evidence indicates that distal airway and alveolar epithelial cells are central drivers of the disease. In this Viewpoint, we review the history of naming and classifications used to define the disease now referred to as IPF, in the context of understanding the clinical presentation, causes, and pathogenesis of the disease. We aim to generate discussion on whether, given the substantial progress made in understanding the clinical, genetic, cellular, and molecular mechanisms involved in the development of IPF, a change of name should be considered. To initiate this discussion, we offer new suggestions to update the name of this disease and new approaches to classify all forms of pulmonary fibrosis."

abstract = "Summary
Background
To enable adequate interpretation of growth measurements in the management of children with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), we assessed growth and its associated determinants in children with PAH.
Methods
We did a retrospective longitudinal study of height and body-mass index in reference to WHO growth standards by pooling data from four contemporary prospective registries of paediatric PAH representing 53 centres in 19 countries. The main outcome measures were median height for age and body-mass index for age percentiles and longitudinal deviation of height for age and body-mass index for age Z scores from WHO standards.
Findings
601 children were followed up for a median of 2·9 years (IQR 1·5–4·4). Baseline median height for age percentile was 26 (IQR 4–54) and baseline median body-mass index for age percentile was 41 (IQR 12–79). Mean height for age Z score was significantly lower than the reference (−0·81, 95% CI −0·93 to −0·69; p<0·0001), as was body-mass index for age Z score (−0·12, −0·25 to −0·01; p=0·047). Height for age Z score was particularly decreased in young patients (aged ≤5 years) with idiopathic or hereditary PAH and in all patients with PAH associated with congenital heart disease. Although Z scores increased in some patients and decreased in others, we detected no significant trend in height for age Z score (p=0·57) or body-mass index for age Z score (p=0·48) before taking account of covariates. Multivariable linear mixed effects modelling showed that age, cause of PAH, ex-prematurity, WHO functional class, trisomy 21, and time since diagnosis were associated with height for age Z score, whereas age, ethnicity, and trisomy 21 were associated with body-mass index for age Z score. A favourable WHO functional class course was independently associated with increases in height for age Z score.
Interpretation
PAH is associated with impaired growth, especially in younger children and those with pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital heart disease. The degree of impairment is independently associated with cause of PAH and comorbidities, but also with disease severity and duration. Because a favourable clinical course was associated with catch-up growth, height for age could serve as an additional and globally available clinical parameter to monitor patients' clinical condition.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in children globally. The cause of pneumonia after introduction of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) has not been well studied in low-income and middle-income countries, and most data are from cross-sectional studies of children admitted to hospital. We aimed to longitudinally investigate the incidence and causes of childhood pneumonia in a South African birth cohort.
Methods
We did a nested case-control study of children in the Drakenstein Child Health Study who developed pneumonia from May 29, 2012, to Dec 1, 2014. Children received immunisations including acellular pertussis vaccine and PCV13. A nested subgroup had nasopharyngeal swabs collected every 2 weeks throughout infancy. We identified pneumonia episodes and collected blood, nasopharyngeal swabs, and induced sputum specimens. We used multiplex real-time PCR to detect pathogens in nasopharyngeal swabs and induced sputum of pneumonia cases and in nasopharyngeal swabs of age-matched and site-matched controls. To show associations between organisms and pneumonia we used conditional logistic regression; results are presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs.
Findings
314 pneumonia cases occurred (incidence of 0·27 episodes per child-year, 95% CI 0·24–0·31; median age 5 months [IQR 3–9]) in 967 children during 1145 child-years of follow-up. 60 (21%) cases of pneumonia were severe (incidence 0·05 episodes per child-year [95% CI 0·04–0·07]) with a case fatality ratio of 1% (three deaths). A median of five organisms (IQR 4–6) were detected in cases and controls with nasopharyngeal swabs, and a median of six organisms (4–7) recorded in induced sputum (p=0·48 compared with nasopharyngeal swabs). Bordetella pertussis (OR 11·08, 95% CI 1·33–92·54), respiratory syncytial virus (8·05, 4·21–15·38), or influenza virus (4·13, 2·06–8·26) were most strongly associated with pneumonia; bocavirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, Haemophilus influenzae, and cytomegalovirus were also associated with pneumonia. In cases, testing of induced sputum in addition to nasopharyngeal swabs provided incremental yield for detection of B pertussis and several viruses.
Interpretation
Pneumonia remains common in this highly vaccinated population. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most frequently detected pathogen associated with pneumonia; influenza virus and B pertussis were also strongly associated with pneumonia. Testing of induced sputum increases the yield for detection of several organisms. New vaccines and strategies are needed to address the burden of childhood pneumonia.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Findings from previous studies showed that mepolizumab significantly reduces the rate of exacerbations in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. To assess the relationship between baseline blood eosinophil counts and efficacy of mepolizumab we did a secondary analysis of data from two studies, stratifying patients by different baseline blood eosinophil thresholds.
Methods
We did a post-hoc analysis of data, which was completed on Sept 25, 2015, from two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of at least 32 weeks duration (NCT01000506 [DREAM] and NCT01691521 [MENSA]) done between 2009 and 2014. In these studies, mepolizumab (DREAM: 75 mg, 250 mg, or 750 mg intravenously; MENSA: 75 mg intravenously or 100 mg subcutaneously) versus placebo was given at 4-week intervals in addition to standard care (high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus ≥1 additional controller with or without daily oral corticosteroids) to patients aged 12 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of asthma, a history of at least two exacerbations in the previous year that required systemic corticosteroid treatment, and evidence of eosinophilic airway inflammation. The primary endpoint in both studies was the annual rate of clinically significant exacerbations (defined as worsening of asthma that required the use of systemic corticosteroids, or admission to hospital, or an emergency-room visit, or a combination of these occurrences). In our analysis, the primary outcome was the annualised rate of exacerbations in patients stratified by baseline eosinophil counts (≥150 cells per μL, ≥300 cells per μL, ≥400 cells per μL, and ≥500 cells per μL) and baseline blood eosinophil ranges (<150 cells per μL, ≥150 cells per μL to <300 cells per μL, ≥300 cells per μL to <500 cells per μL, and ≥500 cells per μL). We based our analysis on the intention-to-treat populations of the two original studies, and all mepolizumab doses were combined for analysis.
Findings
Of 1192 patients, 846 received mepolizumab and 346 received placebo. The overall rate of mean exacerbations per person per year was reduced from 1·91 with placebo to 1·01 with mepolizumab (47% reduction; rate ratio [RR] 0·53, 95% CI 0·44–0·62; p<0·0001). The exacerbation rate reduction with mepolizumab versus placebo increased progressively from 52%; 0·48, 0·39–0·58) in patients with a baseline blood eosinophil count of at least 150 cells per μL to 70%; 0·30, 0·23–0·40]) in patients with a baseline count of at least 500 cells per μL. At a baseline count less than 150 cells per μL, predicted efficacy of mepolizumab was reduced.
Interpretation
Our analysis has shown a close relationship between baseline blood eosinophil count and clinical efficacy of mepolizumab in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma and a history of exacerbations. We noted clinically relevant reductions in exacerbation frequency in patients with a count of 150 cells per μL or more at baseline. The use of this baseline biomarker will help to select patients who are likely to achieve important asthma outcomes with mepolizumab.

With the increase in the global prevalence of obesity, there is a parallel rise in the proportion of obese patients admitted to intensive care units, referred for major surgery or requiring long-term non-invasive ventilation (NIV) at home for chronic respiratory failure. We describe the physiological effect of obesity on the respiratory system mainly in terms of respiratory mechanics, respiratory drive, and patency of the upper airways. Particular attention is given to the prevention and the clinical management of respiratory failure in obese patients with a main focus on invasive and NIV in intensive care during the perioperative period and long-term use of NIV on return home. We also address other aspects of care of obese patients, including antibiotic dosing and catheter-related infections."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Oral acetylcysteine (also known as N-acetylcysteine) is used with pirfenidone to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in Europe. However, no randomised studies have investigated the safety and tolerability of this combination. The PANORAMA study assessed the safety and tolerability of acetylcysteine combined with pirfenidone in patients with IPF. Exploratory efficacy endpoints were also assessed.
Methods
We did a double-blind randomised trial at 48 sites in eight countries. Patients with IPF aged 40–80 years and established on pirfenidone (at least 1602 mg/day for 8 weeks or longer) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio by interactive voice response system to receive concomitant oral acetylcysteine (600 mg, three times daily) or placebo for 24 weeks. A stratified blocked randomisation scheme was used with a block size of 4. Randomisation was stratified by dose of pirfenidone (2403 mg/day [the maximum dose] or <2403 mg/day). Patients, physicians, study staff and the sponsor were masked to treatment group allocation. The primary endpoint was assessment of adverse events, which were collected at each visit and for 28 days after the last dose of study drug. Exploratory efficacy measurements included forced vital capacity (FVC), carbon monoxide diffusing capacity, and 6 min walk distance. Analyses were done in the modified intention-to-treat population, which included all patients who were randomised and received at least one dose of study medication. This study is registered with the European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT number 2012-000564-14) and has been completed.
Findings
123 patients participated in the study between June 28, 2013, and Feb 24, 2015. 61 were assigned to the acetylcysteine group (60 received study medication and included in analysis) and 62 were assigned to the placebo group (all included in analysis). The occurrence of at least one adverse event (46 [77%] patients receiving acetylcysteine vs 50 [81%] receiving placebo), adverse events related to study treatment (17 [28%] vs 16 [26%]), and the number of patients experiencing severe adverse events (three [5%] vs two [3%]), life-threatening adverse events (one [2%] vs one [2%]), or death (one [2%] vs three [5%]) was similar between treatment groups. One case of diarrhoea in the acetylcysteine group was considered severe and related to study treatment. Nine serious adverse events were reported by seven patients: dyspnoea, headache, hypertension, intervertebral disc protrusion, and malignant lung neoplasm in the acetylcysteine group, and aortic aneurysm, contusion, forearm fracture, and worsening IPF in the placebo group. The most common adverse events were cough, nasopharyngitis, and diarrhoea. Photosensitivity occurred more frequently with acetylcysteine (eight [13%] patients) than placebo (one [2%] patient; difference 11·7%; 95% CI 2·6–20·9; p=0·016]), and was not attributable to differences in location, season, or concomitant medication. Four (7%) patients receiving acetylcysteine and three (5%) receiving placebo discontinued study treatment due to adverse events. In the exploratory analysis, change in FVC indicated that clinical benefit from addition of acetylcysteine to pirfenidone is unlikely, with the possibility of a harmful effect in patients with IPF (adjusted rate of decline 125·6 mL/6 months for acetylcysteine vs 34·3 mL/6 months for placebo; difference −91·3 mL; 95% CI −174·4 to −8·3; p=0·031).
Interpretation
Findings from the PANORAMA study suggest that addition of acetylcysteine to pirfenidone does not substantially alter the tolerability profile of pirfenidone, and is unlikely to be beneficial in IPF.

Since the late 1970s when the potential of the immunoreactive trypsinogen assay for early identification of infants with cystic fibrosis was first recognised, the performance of newborn blood spot screening (NBS) has been continually assessed and its use has gradually expanded. NBS for cystic fibrosis is a cost-effective strategy and, if standards of care are fully implemented and robust management pathways are in place, has a positive effect on clinical outcomes. In the past decade, NBS has undergone rapid expansion and an unprecedented number of infants with cystic fibrosis have access to early diagnosis and care. Cystic fibrosis NBS has now moved on from the development phase and is entering an era of consolidation. In the future, research should focus on the rationalisation and optimisation of existing programmes, with particular attention to bioethical implications such as unwanted detection of carriers and inconclusive diagnoses."

abstract = "Summary
The burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the USA continues to grow. Although progress has been made in the the development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and care guidelines, whether patients' quality of life is improved will ultimately depend on the actual implementation of care and an individual patient's access to that care. In this Commission, we summarise expert opinion from key stakeholders—patients, caregivers, and medical professionals, as well as representatives from health systems, insurance companies, and industry—to understand barriers to care delivery and propose potential solutions. Health care in the USA is delivered through a patchwork of provider networks, with a wide variation in access to care depending on a patient's insurance, geographical location, and socioeconomic status. Furthermore, Medicare's complicated coverage and reimbursement structure pose unique challenges for patients with chronic respiratory disease who might need access to several types of services. Throughout this Commission, recurring themes include poor guideline implementation among health-care providers and poor patient access to key treatments such as affordable maintenance drugs and pulmonary rehabilitation. Although much attention has recently been focused on the reduction of hospital readmissions for COPD exacerbations, health systems in the USA struggle to meet these goals, and methods to reduce readmissions have not been proven. There are no easy solutions, but engaging patients and innovative thinkers in the development of solutions is crucial. Financial incentives might be important in raising engagement of providers and health systems. Lowering co-pays for maintenance drugs could result in improved adherence and, ultimately, decreased overall health-care spending. Given the substantial geographical diversity, health systems will need to find their own solutions to improve care coordination and integration, until better data for interventions that are universally effective become available."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Respiratory tract infections and subsequent airway inflammation occur early in the life of infants with cystic fibrosis. However, detailed information about the microbial composition of the respiratory tract in infants with this disorder is scarce. We aimed to undertake longitudinal in-depth characterisation of the upper respiratory tract microbiota in infants with cystic fibrosis during the first year of life.
Methods
We did this prospective cohort study at seven cystic fibrosis centres in Switzerland. Between Feb 1, 2011, and May 31, 2014, we enrolled 30 infants with a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Microbiota characterisation was done with 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing and oligotyping of nasal swabs collected every 2 weeks from the infants with cystic fibrosis. We compared these data with data for an age-matched cohort of 47 healthy infants. We additionally investigated the effect of antibiotic treatment on the microbiota of infants with cystic fibrosis. Statistical methods included regression analyses with a multivariable multilevel linear model with random effects to correct for clustering on the individual level.
Findings
We analysed 461 nasal swabs taken from the infants with cystic fibrosis; the cohort of healthy infants comprised 872 samples. The microbiota of infants with cystic fibrosis differed compositionally from that of healthy infants (p=0·001). This difference was also found in exclusively antibiotic-naive samples (p=0·001). The disordering was mainly, but not solely, due to an overall increase in the mean relative abundance of Staphylococcaceae in infants with cystic fibrosis compared with healthy infants (multivariable linear regression model stratified by age and adjusted for season; second month: coefficient 16·2 [95% CI 0·6–31·9]; p=0·04; third month: 17·9 [3·3–32·5]; p=0·02; fourth month: 21·1 [7·8–34·3]; p=0·002). Oligotyping analysis enabled differentiation between Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococci. Whereas the analysis showed a decrease in S aureus at and after antibiotic treatment, coagulase-negative Staphylococci increased.
Interpretation
Our study describes compositional differences in the microbiota of infants with cystic fibrosis compared with healthy controls, and disordering of the microbiota on antibiotic administration. Besides S aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococci also contributed to the disordering identified in these infants. These findings are clinically important in view of the crucial role that bacterial pathogens have in the disease progression of cystic fibrosis in early life. Our findings could be used to inform future studies of the effect of antibiotic treatment on the microbiota in infants with cystic fibrosis, and could assist in the prevention of early disease progression in infants with this disorder.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The use of non-invasive ventilation is controversial in immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory failure, whereas the use of high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy is growing as an alternative to standard oxygen. We aimed to compare outcomes of immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory failure treated with standard oxygen with those treated with high-flow nasal cannula oxygen alone or high-flow nasal cannula oxygen associated with non-invasive ventilation.
Methods
We did a post-hoc subgroup analysis in a subset of immunocompromised patients with non-hypercapnic acute respiratory failure from a multicentre, randomised, controlled trial. In the trial, patients from 23 intensive care units in France and Belgium were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive either standard oxygen, high-flow nasal cannula alone, or non-invasive ventilation interspaced with high-flow nasal cannula between non-invasive ventilation sessions (non-invasive ventilation group). Patients with profound neutropenia, acute-on-chronic respiratory failure, cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, shock, or altered consciousness were excluded. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who required endotracheal intubation within 28 days after randomisation.
Findings
Of the 82 immunocompromised patients, 30 were treated with standard oxygen, 26 with high-flow nasal cannula alone, and 26 with non-invasive ventilation plus interspaced high-flow nasal cannula. 8 (31%) of 26 patients treated with high-flow nasal cannula alone, 13 (43%) of 30 patients treated with standard oxygen, and 17 (65%) of 26 patients treated with non-invasive ventilation required intubation at 28 days (p=0·04). Odds ratios (ORs) for intubation were higher in patients treated with non-invasive ventilation than in those treated with high-flow nasal cannula: OR 4·25 (95% CI 1·33–13·56). ORs were not significantly different between patients treated with high-flow nasal cannula alone and standard oxygen: OR 1·72 (0·57–5·18). After multivariable logistic regression, the two factors independently associated with endotracheal intubation and mortality were age and use of non-invasive ventilation as first-line therapy.
Interpretation
Non-invasive ventilation might be associated with an increased risk of intubation and mortality and should be used cautiously in immunocompromised patients with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination therapy has shown clinical benefits in patients with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation; however, pretreatment lung function is a confounding factor that potentially affects the efficacy and safety of this therapy. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy in these patients, defined by specific categories of lung function.
Methods
Both trials (TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT) included in this pooled analysis were multinational, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 3 studies. Eligible patients from 187 participating centres in North America, Australia, and the European Union (both trials) were aged 12 years or older with a confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, homozygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation, and with a percent predicted FEV1 (ppFEV1) of 40–90 at the time of screening. Patients were randomly assigned with an interactive web response system (1:1:1) to receive placebo, lumacaftor (600 mg once daily) plus ivacaftor (250 mg every 12 h), or lumacaftor (400 mg every 12 h) plus ivacaftor (250 mg every 12 h) for 24 weeks. Prespecified subgroup analyses of pooled efficacy and safety data by lung function, as measured by ppFEV1, were done for patients with baseline ppFEV1 (<40 and ≥40) and screening ppFEV1 (<70 and ≥70). The primary endpoint was the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 at week 24 analysed in all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study drug. Both trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (TRAFFIC: NCT01807923; TRANSPORT: NCT01807949).
Findings
Both trials were done between April, 2013, and April, 2014. Of the 1108 patients included in the efficacy analysis, 81 patients had a ppFEV1 that decreased to lower than 40 between screening and baseline and 1016 had a ppFEV1 of 40 or higher at baseline. At screening, 730 had a ppFEV1 of less than 70, and 342 had a ppFEV1 of 70 or higher. Improvements in the absolute change from baseline at week 24 in ppFEV1 were observed with both lumacaftor/ivacaftor doses in the subgroup with baseline ppFEV1 levels lower than 40 (least-squares mean difference vs placebo was 3·7 percentage points [95% CI 0·5–6·9; p=0·024] in the lumacaftor [600 mg/day]–ivacaftor group and 3·3 percentage points [0·2–6·4; p=0·036] in the lumacaftor [400 mg/12 h]–ivacaftor group). Improvements in ppFEV1 compared with placebo were also reported in the subgroup with baseline ppFEV1 levels of 40 or higher (3·3 percentage points [2·3–4·4; p<0·0001] in the lumacaftor [600 mg per day]–ivacaftor group and 2·8 percentage points [1·7–3·8; p<0·0001] in the lumacaftor [400 mg/12 h]–ivacaftor group). Similar absolute improvements in ppFEV1 compared with placebo were observed in subgroups with screening ppFEV1 levels lower than 70 and ppFEV1 levels of 70 or higher. Increases in body-mass index and reduction in number of pulmonary exacerbation events were observed in both lumacaftor/ivacaftor dose groups compared with placebo across all lung function subgroups. Treatment was generally well tolerated, although the incidence of some respiratory adverse events was higher with lumacaftor/ivacaftor than with placebo in all subgroups. In patients with baseline ppFEV1 levels lower than 40, these adverse events included cough, dyspnoea, and abnormal respiration.
Interpretation
These analyses confirm that lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination therapy benefits patients with cystic fibrosis homozygous for Phe508del CFTR who have varying degrees of lung function impairment.

abstract = "Summary
Pulmonary hypertension is a substantial global health issue. All age groups are affected with rapidly growing importance in elderly people, particularly in countries with ageing populations. Present estimates suggest a pulmonary hypertension prevalence of about 1% of the global population, which increases up to 10% in individuals aged more than 65 years. In almost all parts of the world, left-sided heart and lung diseases have become the most frequent causes of pulmonary hypertension. About 80% of affected patients live in developing countries, where pulmonary hypertension is frequently associated with congenital heart disease and various infectious disorders, including schistosomiasis, HIV, and rheumatic heart disease. These forms of pulmonary hypertension occur predominantly in those younger than 65 years. Independently of the underlying disease, the development of pulmonary hypertension is associated with clinical deterioration and a substantially increased mortality risk. Global research efforts are needed to establish preventive strategies and treatments for the various types of pulmonary hypertension."

abstract = "Summary
Obstructive sleep apnoea is highly prevalent in the general population worldwide, especially in its mild form. Clinical manifestations correlate poorly with disease severity measured by the apnoea–hypopnoea index (AHI), which complicates diagnosis. Full polysomnography might be more appropriate to assess suspected mild cases because limited ambulatory diagnostic systems are least accurate in mild disease. Treatment options in mild obstructive sleep apnoea include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and oral appliance therapy, in addition to positional therapy and weight reduction when appropriate. The superior efficacy of CPAP in reducing AHI is offset by greater tolerance of oral appliances, especially in mild disease. Although severe obstructive sleep apnoea is associated with adverse health consequences, including cardiometabolic comorbidities, the association with mild disease is unclear, and reports differ regarding the clinical relevance of mild obstructive sleep apnoea. Improved diagnostic techniques and evidence-based approaches to management in mild obstructive sleep apnoea require further research."

abstract = "Summary
Background
In 2010, 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was licensed and recommended in the USA for prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease in children. Licensure was based on immunogenicity data comparing PCV13 with the earlier seven-valent formulation. Because clinical endpoints were not assessed for the new antigens, we did a postlicensure matched case-control study to assess vaccine effectiveness.
Methods
Cases in children aged 2–59 months were identified through active surveillance in 13 sites. Controls were identified via birth registries and matched to cases by age and postal (zip) code. The primary objective was the vaccine effectiveness of at least one dose against the 13 serotypes included in PCV13. Secondary objectives included vaccine effectiveness against all-cause invasive pneumococcal disease, against antibiotic non-susceptible invasive pneumococcal disease, and among children with and without underlying conditions. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated as (1 – matched odds ratio) × 100%.
Findings
We enrolled 722 children with invasive pneumococcal disease and 2991 controls; PCV13 serotype cases (217 [30%]) included most commonly serotypes 19A (128 [18%]), 7F (32 [4%]), and 3 (43 [6%]). Vaccine effectiveness against PCV13 serotypes was 86·0% (95% CI 75·5 to 92·3), driven by serotypes 19A and 7F, for which vaccine effectiveness was 85·6% (95% CI 70·6 to 93·5) and 96·5% (82·7 to 100), respectively. We also identified statistically significant effectiveness against serotype 3 (79·5%, 95% CI 30·3 to 94·8) and against antibiotic non-susceptible invasive pneumococcal disease (65·6%, 44·9 to 78·7). Vaccine effectiveness against all-cause invasive pneumococcal disease was 60·2% (95% CI 46·8 to 70·3). Vaccine effectiveness was similar among children with (81·4%, 95% CI 45·4 to 93·6) and without (85·8%, 74·9 to 91·9) underlying conditions.
Interpretation
PCV13 appears highly effective against invasive pneumococcal disease among children in the USA in the context of routine and catch-up schedules, although some new vaccine antigens could not be assessed. PCV13 immunisation provides a robust strategy for combating pneumococcal antimicrobial resistance.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing requires overnight recordings, such as polygraphy or polysomnography. Considering the cost and low availability of these procedures, preselection of patients at high risk is recommended. We aimed to develop a screening tool allowing identification of individuals at risk of sleep-disordered breathing.
Methods
We used the participants from the population-based HypnoLaus cohort in Lausanne, Switzerland, who had a clinical assessment and polysomnography at home, to build a clinical score (the NoSAS score) using multiple factor analysis and logistic regression to identify people likely to have clinically significant sleep-disordered breathing. The NoSAS score was externally validated in an independent sleep cohort (EPISONO). We compared its performance to existing screening scores (STOP-Bang and Berlin scores).
Findings
We used the 2121 participants from the HypnoLaus cohort who were assessed between Sept 1, 2009, and June 30, 2013. The NoSAS score, which ranges from 0 to 17, allocates 4 points for having a neck circumference of more than 40 cm, 3 points for having a body-mass index of 25 kg/m2 to less than 30 kg/m2 or 5 points for having a body-mass index of 30 kg/m2 or more, 2 points for snoring, 4 points for being older than 55 years of age, and 2 points for being male. Using a threshold of 8 points or more, the NoSAS score identified individuals at risk of clinically significant sleep-disordered breathing, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0·74 (95% CI 0·72–0·76). It showed an even higher performance in the EPISONO cohort, with an AUC of 0·81 (0·77–0·85). The NoSAS score performed significantly better than did the STOP-Bang (AUC 0·67 [95% CI 0·65–0·69]; p<0·0001) and Berlin (0·63 [0·61–0·66]; p<0·0001) scores.
Interpretation
The NoSAS score is a simple, efficient, and easy to implement score enabling identification of individuals at risk of sleep-disordered breathing. Because of its high discrimination power, the NoSAS score can help clinicians to decide which patients to further investigate with a nocturnal recording.

Background
Acute pulmonary exacerbations are associated with progressive lung function decline and increased mortality in cystic fibrosis. The role of pulmonary vascular disease in pulmonary exacerbations is unknown. We aimed to assess the association between pulmonary artery enlargement (defined as pulmonary artery diameter to ascending aorta diameter [PA:A] ratio >1), a marker of pulmonary vascular disease, and exacerbations.
Methods
In this cohort study, we used clinical, CT imaging, and prospective exacerbation data from a previous prospective clinical trial (derivation cohort) and from The Prince Charles Hospital (TPCH; Brisbane, QLD, Australia) cystic fibrosis registry (validation cohort). In our derivation cohort, we included adults aged 18 years or older with cystic fibrosis and at least one CFTR nonsense mutation, who were enrolled in the trial between Sept 8, 2009, and Nov 30, 2010, randomly assigned to receive placebo, and had baseline CT imaging. Our validation cohort included adult patients with cystic fibrosis who had CT imaging performed between Jan 1, 2002, and Dec 31, 2014. We measured the PA:A ratio at the level of the pulmonary artery bifurcation on CT scans. Patients in each cohort were separated into two groups on the basis of PA:A ratio (>1 or ≤1) and were followed up for 1 year in the derivation cohort and 2 years in the validation cohort. The primary endpoint was the development of one or more acute pulmonary exacerbations during follow-up. We used linear and logistic regression models to determine associations between clinical factors, the PA:A ratio, and pulmonary exacerbations. We used Cox regression to determine the time to first exacerbation in the validation cohort.
Findings
37 (50%) of 74 patients in the derivation cohort and 89 (47%) of 190 patients in the validation cohort had enlarged pulmonary arteries (PA:A>1). 50 (68%) patients in the derivation cohort had one or more exacerbations at 1 year and 133 (70%) patients in the validation cohort had one or more exacerbations at 2 years. At baseline, patients with pulmonary artery enlargement were younger than those without enlargement in both cohorts and had elevated sweat chloride concentrations in the derivation cohort (100·5 mmol/L [SD 10·9] vs 90·4 mmol/L [19·9]; difference 10·1 mmol/L [95% CI 2·5–17·7], p=0·017). Pulmonary artery enlargement was associated with exacerbations in the derivation cohort (odds ratio 3·49 [95% CI 1·18–10·3], p=0·023) when adjusted for sex, body-mass index (BMI), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), and PA:A greater than 1, and in the validation cohort (2·41 [1·06–5·52], p=0·037) when adjusted for sex, BMI, chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, FEV1/FVC (forced vital capacity), PA:A greater than 1, and previous exacerbation. The time to first exacerbation was shorter in patients with enlarged pulmonary arteries than in those with normal-sized pulmonary arteries in the validation cohort (hazard ratio 1·66 [95% CI 1·18–2·34], p=0·0038) in unadjusted analysis, but not when adjusted for sex, BMI, exacerbations within 1 year before index CT scan, FEV1/FVC, and chronic P aeruginosa infection (1·14 [0·80–1·62], p=0·82).
Interpretation
Pulmonary artery enlargement is prevalent in adult patients with cystic fibrosis and was associated with acute pulmonary exacerbation risk in two well characterised cohorts. The PA:A ratio could be a predictive marker in cystic fibrosis.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Protective mechanical ventilation strategies using low tidal volume or high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) improve outcomes for patients who have had surgery. The role of the driving pressure, which is the difference between the plateau pressure and the level of positive end-expiratory pressure is not known. We investigated the association of tidal volume, the level of PEEP, and driving pressure during intraoperative ventilation with the development of postoperative pulmonary complications.
Methods
We did a meta-analysis of individual patient data from randomised controlled trials of protective ventilation during general anesthaesia for surgery published up to July 30, 2015. The main outcome was development of postoperative pulmonary complications (postoperative lung injury, pulmonary infection, or barotrauma).
Findings
We included data from 17 randomised controlled trials, including 2250 patients. Multivariate analysis suggested that driving pressure was associated with the development of postoperative pulmonary complications (odds ratio [OR] for one unit increase of driving pressure 1·16, 95% CI 1·13–1·19; p<0·0001), whereas we detected no association for tidal volume (1·05, 0·98–1·13; p=0·179). PEEP did not have a large enough effect in univariate analysis to warrant inclusion in the multivariate analysis. In a mediator analysis, driving pressure was the only significant mediator of the effects of protective ventilation on development of pulmonary complications (p=0·027). In two studies that compared low with high PEEP during low tidal volume ventilation, an increase in the level of PEEP that resulted in an increase in driving pressure was associated with more postoperative pulmonary complications (OR 3·11, 95% CI 1·39–6·96; p=0·006).
Interpretation
In patients having surgery, intraoperative high driving pressure and changes in the level of PEEP that result in an increase of driving pressure are associated with more postoperative pulmonary complications. However, a randomised controlled trial comparing ventilation based on driving pressure with usual care is needed to confirm these findings.

abstract = "Summary
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an umbrella term that covers many clinical subtypes with clearly different pulmonary and extra-pulmonary characteristics, but with persistent airflow limitation in common. This insight has led to the development of a more personalised approach in bronchodilator therapy, prevention of exacerbations, and advanced treatments (such as non-invasive ventilation and lung volume reduction techniques). However, systemic manifestations and comorbidities of COPD also contribute to different clinical phenotypes and warrant an individualised approach as part of integrated disease management. Alterations in bodyweight and composition, from cachexia to obesity, demand specific management. Psychological symptoms are highly prevalent, and thorough diagnosis and treatment are necessary. Moreover, prevention of exacerbations requires interventions beyond the lungs, including treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, reduction of cardiovascular risks, and management of dyspnoea and anxiety. In this Review, we discuss the management of COPD beyond the respiratory system and propose treatment strategies on the basis of the latest research and best practices."

The most common forms of pulmonary hypertension are pulmonary arterial hypertension, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, and pulmonary hypertension due to left-sided heart and lung disease. The treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension has advanced substantially over the past 20 years. Five different classes of drugs are now available—ie, endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators, prostacyclin analogues, and prostacyclin receptor agonists. Long-term studies have provided evidence that various combinations of these compounds improve the progression-free survival of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. For patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, surgical pulmonary endarterectomy is the treatment of choice. For patients who are inoperable and have chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, riociguat, a stimulator of soluble guanylate cyclase, has proven efficacious. Additionally, interventional approaches could become a treatment option for these patients. For patients with pulmonary hypertension due to left-sided heart disease or lung disease, the use of pulmonary vasodilator treatment has not been proven to be safe and effective."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Severe asthma is a complex heterogeneous disease associated with older age and obesity. The presence of eosinophilic (type 2) inflammation in some but not all patients with severe asthma predicts responsiveness to current treatments, but new treatment approaches will require a better understanding of non-type 2 mechanisms of severe asthma. We considered the possibility that systemic inflammation, which arises in subgroups of obese and older patients, increases the severity of asthma. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a biomarker of systemic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction, and we aimed to explore the association between IL-6 concentrations, metabolic dysfunction, and asthma severity.
Methods
In this cross-sectional analysis, patients were recruited from two cohorts: mainly non-severe asthmatics from the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) and mainly severe asthmatics from the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP). We generated a reference range for plasma IL-6 in a cohort of healthy control patients. We compared the clinical characteristics of asthmatics with plasma IL-6 concentrations above (IL-6 high) and below (IL-6 low) the upper 95% centile value for plasma IL-6 concentration in the healthy cohort. We also compared how pulmonary function, frequency of asthma exacerbations, and frequency of severe asthma differed between IL-6 low and IL-6 high asthma populations in the two asthma cohorts.
Findings
Between Jan 1, 2005, and Dec 31, 2014, we recruited 249 patients from UCSF and between Nov 1, 2012, and Oct 1, 2014, we recruited 387 patients from SARP. The upper 95th centile value for plasma IL-6 concentration in the healthy cohort (n=93) was 3·1 pg/mL, and 14% (36/249) of UCSF cohort and 26% (102/387) of the SARP cohort had plasma IL-6 concentrations above this upper limit. The IL-6 high patients in both asthma cohorts had a significantly higher average BMI (p<0·0001) and a higher prevalence of hypertension (p<0·0001) and diabetes (p=0·04) than the IL-6 low patients. IL-6 high patients also had significantly worse lung function and more frequent asthma exacerbations than IL-6 low patients (all p values <0·0001). Although 80% (111/138) of IL-6 high asthmatic patients were obese, 62% (178/289) of obese asthmatic patients were IL-6 low. Among obese patients, the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) was significantly lower in IL-6 high than in IL-6 low patients (mean percent predicted FEV1 68·6% [SD 18·7] vs 76·0% [19·4]; p=0·001), and the percentage of patients reporting an asthma exacerbation in the past 1–2 years was higher in IL-6 high than in IL-6 low patients (66% [73/111] vs 48% [85/178]; p=0·003). Among non-obese asthmatics, FEV1 values and the frequency of asthma exacerbations within the past 1–2 years were also significantly worse in IL-6 high than in IL-6 low patients (mean FEV1 64·2% [SD 22·7] vs 81·1% [20·1] predicted; p<0·0001; 59% [16/27] vs 34% [108/320]; p=0·01).
Interpretation
Systemic IL-6 inflammation and clinical features of metabolic dysfunction, which occur most commonly in a subset of obese asthma patients but also in a small subset of non-obese patients, are associated with more severe asthma. These data provide strong rationale to undertake clinical trials of IL-6 inhibitors or treatments that reduce metabolic dysfunction in a subset of patients with severe asthma. Plasma IL-6 is a biomarker that could guide patient stratification in these trials.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Critical care physicians recognise persistent critical illness as a specific syndrome, yet few data exist for the timing of the transition from acute to persistent critical illness. Defining the onset of persistent critical illness as the time at which diagnosis and illness severity at intensive care unit (ICU) arrival no longer predict outcome better than do simple pre-ICU patient characteristics, we measured the timing of this onset at a population level in Australia and New Zealand, and the variation therein, and assessed the characteristics, burden of care, and hospital outcomes of patients with persistent critical illness.
Methods
In this retrospective, population-based, observational study, we used data for ICU admission in Australia and New Zealand from the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Adult Patient Database. We included all patients older than 16 years of age admitted to a participating ICU. We excluded patients transferred from another hospital and those admitted to an ICU for palliative care or awaiting organ donation. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Using statistical methods in evenly split development and validation samples for risk score development, we examined the ability of characteristics to predict in-hospital mortality.
Findings
Between Jan, 2000, and Dec, 2014, we studied 1 028 235 critically ill patients from 182 ICUs across Australia and New Zealand. Among patients still in an ICU, admission diagnosis and physiological derangements, which accurately predicted outcome on admission (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve 0·898 [95% CI 0·897–0·899] in the validation cohort), progressively lost their predictive ability and no longer predicted outcome more accurately than did simple antecedent patient characteristics (eg, age, sex, or chronic health status) after 10 days in the ICU, thus empirically defining the onset of persistent critical illness. This transition occurred between day 7 and day 22 across diagnosis-based subgroups and between day 6 and day 15 across risk-of-death-based subgroups. Cases of persistent critical illness accounted for only 51 509 (5·0%) of the 1 028 235 patients admitted to an ICU, but for 1 029 345 (32·8%) of 3 138 432 ICU bed-days and 2 197 108 (14·7%) of 14 961 693 hospital bed-days. Overall, 12 625 (24·5%) of 51 509 patients with persistent critical illness died and only 23 968 (46·5%) of 51 509 were discharged home.
Interpretation
Onset of persistent critical illness can be empirically measured at a population level. Patients with this condition consume vast resources, have high mortality, have much less chance of returning home than do typical ICU patients, and require dedicated future research. ICU clinicians should be aware that the risk of in-hospital mortality can change quickly over the first 2 weeks of an ICU course and be sure to incorporate such changes in their decision making and prognostication.

Background
Long-term prognosis of patients with characteristics of both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, named asthma-COPD overlap, is poorly described. We investigated the long-term prognosis of individuals with different types of chronic airway disease, with a special focus on individuals with asthma-COPD overlap.
Methods
We assigned participants from the Copenhagen City Heart Study into six subgroups: healthy never-smokers, ever-smokers without asthma and COPD, those with asthma with low cumulated smoking exposure and no airflow limitation, those with COPD, those with asthma-COPD overlap with asthma onset before the age of 40 years, and those with asthma-COPD overlap with asthma onset after the age of 40 years. We defined asthma-COPD overlap as current self-reported asthma and a postbronchodilatatory forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) to forced vital capacity ratio of less than 0·7, without any restrictions regarding smoking. We investigated the course of FEV1 decline for 18 years and risk of admission to hospital due to exacerbations or pneumonias and respiratory and all-cause mortality for 22 years. We analysed FEV1 decline in the six groups using a linear mixed-effects model.
Findings
We included 8382 participants from the Copenhagen City Heart Study in our study: 2199 never-smokers, 5435 ever-smokers, 158 with asthma, 320 with COPD, 68 with asthma-COPD overlap with early-onset asthma, and 202 with asthma-COPD overlap with late-onset asthma. The multivariable-adjusted decline in FEV1 in asthma-COPD overlap with early-onset asthma was 27·3 mL (standard error 5·0) per year, which did not differ significantly from the decline of 20·9 mL (1·2) per year in healthy never-smokers (p=0·19). FEV1 decline in individuals with asthma-COPD overlap with late-onset asthma was 49·6 mL (3·0) per year, higher than the decline in asthma-COPD overlap with early-onset asthma (p=0·0001), the decline of 39·5 mL (2·5) per year in COPD (p=0·003), and the decline in healthy never-smokers (p<0·0001). Hazard ratios for hospital admissions due to exacerbations of asthma or COPD were 39·48 (95% CI 25·93–60·11) in asthma-COPD overlap with early-onset asthma, 83·47 (61·67–112·98) in asthma-COPD overlap with late-onset asthma, 23·80 (17·43–33·50) in COPD, and 14·74 (10·06–21·59) in asthma compared with never-smokers without lung disease (all p<0·0001). Life expectancy was 9·3 years (5·4–13·1) shorter in participants with asthma-COPD overlap with early-onset asthma, 12·8 years (11·1–14·6) shorter in those with asthma-COPD overlap with late-onset asthma, 10·1 years (8·6–11·5) shorter in those with COPD (all p<0·0001), and 3·3 years (1·0–5·5) shorter in those with asthma (p=0·004) than in healthy never-smokers.
Interpretation
Prognosis of individuals with asthma-COPD overlap is poor and seems to be affected by the age of recognition of asthma, being worst in those with late asthma onset (after 40 years of age). Such patients should be followed up closely to prevent fast lung function decline and exacerbations.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Several randomised controlled studies and a previous meta-analysis have reported conflicting results regarding the effect of combined targeted therapy compared with monotherapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of a combination of PAH-specific therapies compared with monotherapy on predefined clinical worsening in PAH.
Methods
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for reports published from Jan 1, 1990, to May 31, 2015, of prospective randomised controlled trials of at least 12 weeks that assessed a combination of PAH-specific therapies (upfront and sequential add-on) compared with background PAH-specific monotherapy in patients older than 12 years. We extracted data from the reports, and assessed the primary outcome of risk of clinical worsening, as defined a priori in each trial, using the Mantel-Haenszel method based on a fixed-effects model.
Findings
Of 2017 studies that we identified from our search, we included 17 (4095 patients) in our analysis. 15 studies assessed clinical worsening and were included in the primary analysis. Combined therapy was associated with significant risk reduction for clinical worsening compared with monotherapy (combined therapy 17% [332 of 1940 patients] vs monotherapy 28% [517 of 1862 patients], risk ratio [RR] 0·65 [95% CI 0·58–0·72], p<0·00001). We noted no heterogeneity between the studies (I2=18%, phomogeneity=0·25). A publication bias was suggested by the results of an Egger test (t=–2·3982, p=0·031), but when we excluded the four studies with the highest SEs, the RR for clinical worsening was identical (0·65 [95% CI 0·58–0·73], p<0·00001).
Interpretation
In our analysis, combined therapy for PAH was associated with a significant reduction in clinical worsening compared with monotherapy. However, our study was limited by the variable definition of clinical worsening among the trials and possible publication bias. Because many patients still had clinical worsening with combination therapy, identification of innovative therapeutic targets for PAH is thus urgently needed.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Bacteria and viruses are equally associated with the risk of acute episodes of asthma-like symptoms in young children, suggesting antibiotics as a potential treatment for such episodes. We aimed to assess the effect of azithromycin on the duration of respiratory episodes in young children with recurrent asthma-like symptoms, hypothesising that it reduces the duration of the symptomatic period.
Methods
In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited children aged 1–3 years, who were diagnosed with recurrent asthma-like symptoms from the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 cohort; a birth cohort consisting of the general Danish population of Zealand, including Copenhagen. Exclusion criteria were macrolide allergy, heart, liver, neurological, and kidney disease, and, before each treatment, one or more clinical signs of pneumonia (respiratory frequency of ≥50 breaths per min; fever of ≥39°C; C-reactive protein concentration of ≥476·20 nmol/L [≥50 mg/L]). Each episode of asthma-like symptoms lasting at least 3 days was randomly allocated to a 3-day course of azithromycin oral solution of 10 mg/kg per day or placebo after thorough examination by a study physician at the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma research unit. Each episode was randomly allocated independently of previous treatment from a computer-generated list of random numbers in blocks of ten (generated at the Pharmacy of Glostrup). Investigators and children were masked until the youngest child turned 3 years of age and throughout the data validation and analysis phases. The primary outcome was duration of the respiratory episode after treatment, verified by prospective daily diaries and analysed with Poisson regression. Analyses were per protocol (excluding those without a primary outcome measure or who did not receive treatment). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01233297.
Findings
Between Nov 17, 2010, and Jan 28, 2014, we randomly allocated 158 asthma-like episodes in 72 children (79 [50%] to azithromycin and 79 [50%] to placebo). The mean duration of the episode after treatment was 3·4 days for children receiving azithromycin compared with 7·7 days for children receiving placebo. Azithromycin caused a significant shortening of the episode of 63·3% (95% CI 56·0–69·3; p<0·0001). The effect size increased with early initiation of treatment, showing a reduction in episode duration of 83% if treatment was initiated before day 6 of the episode compared with 36% if initiated on or after day 6 (p<0·0001). We noted no differences in clinical adverse events between the azithromycin (18 [23%] of 78 episodes included in final analysis) and placebo (24 [30%] of 79) groups (p=0·30), but we did not investigate bacterial resistance patterns after treatment.
Interpretation
Azithromycin reduced the duration of episodes of asthma-like symptoms in young children, suggesting that this drug could have a role in acute management of exacerbations. Further research is needed to disentangle the inflammatory versus antimicrobial aspects of this relation.

The central role of the microbiome in critical illness is supported by a half century of experimental and clinical study. The physiological effects of critical illness and the clinical interventions of intensive care substantially alter the microbiome. In turn, the microbiome predicts patients' susceptibility to disease, and manipulation of the microbiome has prevented or modulated critical illness in animal models and clinical trials. This Review surveys the microbial ecology of critically ill patients, presents the facts and unanswered questions surrounding gut-derived sepsis, and explores the radically altered ecosystem of the injured alveolus. The revolution in culture-independent microbiology has provided the tools needed to target the microbiome rationally for the prevention and treatment of critical illness, holding great promise to improve the acute and chronic outcomes of the critically ill."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Despite the established vulnerability of children during airway management, remarkably little is known about complications in children with difficult tracheal intubation. To address this concern, we developed a multicentre registry (Pediatric Difficult Intubation [PeDI]) to characterise risk factors for difficult tracheal intubation, establish the success rates of various tracheal intubation techniques, catalogue the complications of children with difficult tracheal intubation, and establish the effect of more than two tracheal intubation attempts on complications.
Methods
The PeDI registry consists of prospectively collected tracheal intubation data from 13 children's hospitals in the USA. We established standard data collection methods before implementing the secure web-based registry. After establishing standard definitions, we collected and analysed patient, clinician, and practice data and tracheal intubation outcomes. We categorised complications as severe or non-severe.
Findings
Between August, 2012, and January, 2015, 1018 difficult paediatric tracheal intubation encounters were done. The most frequently attempted first tracheal intubation techniques were direct laryngoscopy (n=461, 46%), fibre-optic bronchoscopy (n=284 [28%]), and indirect video laryngoscopy (n=183 [18%]) with first attempt success rates of 16 (3%) of 461 with direct laryngoscopy, 153 (54%) of 284 with fibre-optic bronchoscopy, and 101 (55%) of 183 with indirect video laryngoscopy. Tracheal intubation failed in 19 (2%) of cases. 204 (20%) children had at least one complication; 30 (3%) of these were severe and 192 (19%) were non-severe. The most common severe complication was cardiac arrest, which occurred in 15 (2%) patients. The occurrence of complications was associated with more than two tracheal intubation attempts, a weight of less than 10 kg, short thyromental distance, and three direct laryngoscopy attempts before an indirect technique. Temporary hypoxaemia was the most frequent non-severe complication.
Interpretation
More than two direct laryngoscopy attempts in children with difficult tracheal intubation are associated with a high failure rate and an increased incidence of severe complications. These results suggest that limiting the number of direct laryngoscopy attempts and quickly transitioning to an indirect technique when direct laryngoscopy fails would enhance patient safety.

We review the cardiac safety of the drugs available at present for the maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in stable disease, focusing on inhaled long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) and long-acting β2 agonists (LABA), used either as a monotherapy or as a fixed-dose combination. We report the difficulties of, and pitfalls in, the investigation of the safety of drug treatments in COPD, which is hampered by the so-called COPD trial paradox: on the one hand, COPD is defined as a systemic disease and is frequently associated with comorbidities (especially cardiovascular comorbidities), which have an important effect on the prognosis of individual patients; on the other hand, patients with COPD and cardiovascular or other coexisting illnesses are often excluded from participation in randomised controlled clinical trials. In these trials, inhaled long-acting bronchodilators, both LAMA or LABA, or both, seem to be safe when used in the appropriate dose in adherent patients with COPD without uncontrolled cardiovascular disease or other notable comorbidities. However, the cardiac safety of LAMA and LABA is less evident when used inappropriately (eg, overdosing) or in patients with COPD and substantial cardiovascular disease, prolonged QTc interval, or polypharmacy. Potential warnings about rare cardiac events caused by COPD treatment from meta-analyses and observational studies need to be confirmed in high quality large randomised controlled trials. Finally, we briefly cover the cardiac safety issues of chronic oral drug treatments for COPD, encompassing theophylline, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and macrolides."

A decade of rapid technological advances has provided an exciting opportunity to incorporate information relating to a range of potentially important disease determinants in the clinical decision-making process. Access to highly detailed data will enable respiratory medicine to evolve from one-size-fits-all models of care, which are associated with variable clinical effectiveness and high rates of side-effects, to precision approaches, where treatment is tailored to individual patients. The human microbiome has increasingly been recognised as playing an important part in determining disease course and response to treatment. Its inclusion in precision models of respiratory medicine, therefore, is essential. Analysis of the microbiome provides an opportunity to develop novel prognostic markers for airways disease, improve definition of clinical phenotypes, develop additional guidance to aid treatment selection, and increase the accuracy of indicators of treatment effect. In this Review we propose that collaboration between researchers and clinicians is needed if respiratory medicine is to replicate the successes of precision medicine seen in other clinical specialties."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Smokers increasingly use e-cigarettes for many reasons, including attempts to quit combustible cigarettes and to use nicotine where smoking is prohibited. We aimed to assess the association between e-cigarette use and cigarette smoking cessation among adult cigarette smokers, irrespective of their motivation for using e-cigarettes.
Methods
PubMed and Web of Science were searched between April 27, 2015, and June 17, 2015. Data extracted included study location, design, population, definition and prevalence of e-cigarette use, comparison group (if applicable), cigarette consumption, level of nicotine dependence, other confounders, definition of quitting smoking, and odds of quitting smoking. The primary endpoint was cigarette smoking cessation. Odds of smoking cessation among smokers using e-cigarettes compared with smokers not using e-cigarettes were assessed using a random effects meta-analysis. A modification of the ACROBAT-NRSI tool and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool were used to assess bias. This meta-analysis is registered with PROSPERO (number CRD42015020382).
Findings
38 studies (of 577 studies identified) were included in the systematic review; all 20 studies with control groups (15 cohort studies, three cross-sectional studies, and two clinical trials) were included in random effects meta-analysis and sensitivity analyses. Odds of quitting cigarettes were 28% lower in those who used e-cigarettes compared with those who did not use e-cigarettes (odds ratio [OR] 0·72, 95% CI 0·57–0·91). Association of e-cigarette use with quitting did not significantly differ among studies of all smokers using e-cigarettes (irrespective of interest in quitting cigarettes) compared with studies of only smokers interested in cigarette cessation (OR 0·63, 95% CI 0·45–0·86 vs 0·86, 0·60–1·23; p=0·94). Other study characteristics (design, population, comparison group, control variables, time of exposure assessment, biochemical verification of abstinence, and definition of e-cigarette use) were also not associated with the overall effect size (p≥0·77 in all cases).
Interpretation
As currently being used, e-cigarettes are associated with significantly less quitting among smokers.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Ivacaftor has been shown to be a safe, effective treatment for cystic fibrosis in patients aged 6 years or older with a CFTR gating mutation. We aimed to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ivacaftor in children aged 2–5 years.
Methods
In the two-part KIWI study, we enrolled children aged 2–5 years weighing 8 kg or more with a confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and a CFTR gating mutation on at least one allele from 15 hospitals in the USA, UK, and Canada. Participants received oral ivacaftor 50 mg (if bodyweight <14 kg) or 75 mg (if bodyweight ≥14 kg) every 12 h for 4 days in part A (to establish the short-term safety of doses for subsequent assessment in part B), and then for 24 weeks in part B (to assess safety and longer-term pharmacodynamics). Children could participate in both or just one part of the study. Primary outcomes were pharmacokinetics and safety, analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of ivacaftor. Secondary outcomes were absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride concentrations and bodyweight, body-mass index (BMI), and height Z scores, and pharmacokinetic parameter estimation of ivacaftor. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01705145.
Findings
Between Jan 8, 2013, and March 1, 2013, nine patients were enrolled onto part A of the study, all of whom completed the 4 day treatment period, and eight of whom took part in part B. Between June 28, 2013, and Sept 26, 2013, 34 patients were enrolled in part B, 33 of whom completed the 24 week treatment period. All patients received at least one dose of ivacaftor. Results of ivacaftor pharmacokinetics suggested that exposure was similar to that reported in adults (median Cmin were 536 ng/mL for the 50 mg dose; 580 ng/mL for the 75 mg dose; median ivacaftor AUC values were 9840 ng × h/mL and 10 200 ng × h/mL, respectively). Common adverse events in part B included cough (in 19 [56%] of 34 patients) and vomiting (in ten [29%]). Five (15%) patients had liver function test (LFT) results that were more than eight times higher than the upper limit of normal, four of whom had study drug interrupted, and one of whom had study drug discontinued. Six (18%) of 34 patients had seven serious adverse events; a raised concentration of transaminases was the only serious adverse event regarded as related to ivacaftor and the only adverse event that resulted in study treatment discontinuation. At week 24, in patients for whom we had data, sweat chloride had changed from baseline by a mean of −46·9 mmol/L (SD 26·2, p<0·0001), weight Z score by 0·2 (0·3; p<0·0001), BMI Z score by 0·4 (0·4, p<0·0001), and height Z score by −0·01 (0·3; p=0·84).
Interpretation
Ivacaftor at doses of 50 mg and 75 mg seems to be safe in children aged 2–5 years with cystic fibrosis with a gating mutation followed up for 24 weeks, although the frequency of elevated LFTs suggests that monitoring should be frequent in young children, particularly those with a history of elevated LFTs. Results of an ongoing extension study assessing durability of these effects and longer-term safety are warranted.

Pulmonary hypertension is a well recognised complication of chronic hypoxic lung diseases, which are among the most common causes of death and disability worldwide. Development of pulmonary hypertension independently predicts reduced life expectancy. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, long-term oxygen therapy ameliorates pulmonary hypertension and greatly improves survival, although the correction of alveolar hypoxia and pulmonary hypertension is only partial. Advances in understanding of the regulation of vascular smooth muscle tone show that chronic vasoconstriction plays a more important part in the pathogenesis of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension than previously thought, and that structural vascular changes contribute less. Trials of existing vasodilators show that pulmonary hypertension can be ameliorated and systemic oxygen delivery improved in carefully selected patients, although systemic hypotensive effects limit the doses used. Vasoconstrictor pathways that are selective for the pulmonary circulation can be blocked to reduce hypoxic pulmonary hypertension without causing systemic hypotension, and thus provide potential targets for novel therapeutic strategies."

Background
Active pulmonary tuberculosis is difficult to diagnose and treatment response is difficult to effectively monitor. A WHO consensus statement has called for new non-sputum diagnostics. The aim of this study was to use an integrated multicohort analysis of samples from publically available datasets to derive a diagnostic gene set in the peripheral blood of patients with active tuberculosis.
Methods
We searched two public gene expression microarray repositories and retained datasets that examined clinical cohorts of active pulmonary tuberculosis infection in whole blood. We compared gene expression in patients with either latent tuberculosis or other diseases versus patients with active tuberculosis using our validated multicohort analysis framework. Three datasets were used as discovery datasets and meta-analytical methods were used to assess gene effects in these cohorts. We then validated the diagnostic capacity of the three gene set in the remaining 11 datasets.
Findings
A total of 14 datasets containing 2572 samples from 10 countries from both adult and paediatric patients were included in the analysis. Of these, three datasets (N=1023) were used to discover a set of three genes (GBP5, DUSP3, and KLF2) that are highly diagnostic for active tuberculosis. We validated the diagnostic power of the three gene set to separate active tuberculosis from healthy controls (global area under the ROC curve (AUC) 0·90 [95% CI 0·85–0·95]), latent tuberculosis (0·88 [0·84–0·92]), and other diseases (0·84 [0·80–0·95]) in eight independent datasets composed of both children and adults from ten countries. Expression of the three-gene set was not confounded by HIV infection status, bacterial drug resistance, or BCG vaccination. Furthermore, in four additional cohorts, we showed that the tuberculosis score declined during treatment of patients with active tuberculosis.
Interpretation
Overall, our integrated multicohort analysis yielded a three-gene set in whole blood that is robustly diagnostic for active tuberculosis, that was validated in multiple independent cohorts, and that has potential clinical application for diagnosis and monitoring treatment response. Prospective laboratory validation will be required before it can be used in a clinical setting.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Mutations in the gene encoding the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II (BMPR2) are the commonest genetic cause of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). However, the effect of BMPR2 mutations on clinical phenotype and outcomes remains uncertain.
Methods
We analysed individual participant data of 1550 patients with idiopathic, heritable, and anorexigen-associated PAH from eight cohorts that had been systematically tested for BMPR2 mutations. The primary outcome was the composite of death or lung transplantation. All-cause mortality was the secondary outcome. Hazard ratios (HRs) for death or transplantation and all-cause mortality associated with the presence of BMPR2 mutation were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models stratified by cohort.
Findings
Overall, 448 (29%) of 1550 patients had a BMPR2 mutation. Mutation carriers were younger at diagnosis (mean age 35·4 [SD 14·8] vs 42·0 [17·8] years), had a higher mean pulmonary artery pressure (60·5 [13·8] vs 56·4 [15·3] mm Hg) and pulmonary vascular resistance (16·6 [8·3] vs 12·9 [8·3] Wood units), and lower cardiac index (2·11 [0·69] vs 2·51 [0·92] L/min per m2; all p<0·0001). Patients with BMPR2 mutations were less likely to respond to acute vasodilator testing (3% [10 of 380] vs 16% [147 of 907]; p<0·0001). Among the 1164 individuals with available survival data, age-adjusted and sex-adjusted HRs comparing BMPR2 mutation carriers with non-carriers were 1·42 (95% CI 1·15–1·75; p=0·0011) for the composite of death or lung transplantation and 1·27 (1·00–1·60; p=0·046) for all-cause mortality. These HRs were attenuated after adjustment for potential mediators including pulmonary vascular resistance, cardiac index, and vasoreactivity. HRs for death or transplantation and all-cause mortality associated with BMPR2 mutation were similar in men and women, but higher in patients with a younger age at diagnosis (p=0·0030 for death or transplantation, p=0·011 for all-cause mortality).
Interpretation
Patients with PAH and BMPR2 mutations present at a younger age with more severe disease, and are at increased risk of death, and death or transplantation, compared with those without BMPR2 mutations.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Disturbed circadian rhythm is a potentially modifiable cause of delirium among patients in intensive-care units (ICUs). Bright-light therapy in the daytime can realign circadian rhythm and reduce the incidence of delirium. We investigated whether a high-intensity dynamic light application (DLA) would reduce ICU-acquired delirium.
Methods
This was a randomised, controlled, single-centre trial of medical and surgical patients admitted to the ICU of a teaching hospital in the Netherlands. Patients older than 18 years, expected to stay in the ICU longer than 24 h and who could be assessed for delirium were randomised to DLA or normal lighting (control), according to a computer-generated schedule. The DLA was administered through ceiling-mounted fluorescent tubes that delivered bluish-white light up to 1700 lux between 0900 h and 1600 h, except for 1130–1330 h, when the light was dimmed to 300 lux. The light could only be turned off centrally by investigators. Control light levels were 300 lux and lights could be turned on and off from inside the room. The primary endpoint was the cumulative incidence of ICU-acquired delirium. Analyses were by intention to treat and per protocol. The study was terminated prematurely after an interim analysis for futility. This study is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT01274819.
Findings
Between July 1, 2011, and Sept 9, 2013, 734 patients were enrolled, 361 in the DLA group and 373 in the control group. Delirium occurred in 137 (38%) of 361 DLA patients and 123 (33%) of 373 control patients (odds ratio 1·24, 95% CI 0·92–1·68, p=0·16). No adverse events were noted in patients or staff.
Interpretation
DLA as a single intervention does not reduce the cumulative incidence of delirium. Bright-light therapy should be assessed as part of a multicomponent strategy.
Funding
None."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Skeletal muscle dysfunction and exercise intolerance are common in severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We assessed the effectiveness of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) as a home-based exercise therapy.
Methods
In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, undertaken across three UK National Health Service sites, we randomly assigned (1:1) adults with COPD, a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) less than 50% predicted, and incapacitating breathlessness (Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale ≥4) to receive active or placebo NMES, daily over a 6-week period. Randomisation was by an independent system using minimisation to balance age, GOLD stage, and quadriceps strength. Participants and outcome assessors were masked to group allocation. The primary endpoint was change in 6-min walk test (6MWT) distance at 6 weeks. Analysis was by intention to treat. The trial was registered as ISRCTN15985261 and is now closed.
Findings
Between June 29, 2012, and July 4, 2014, we enrolled 73 participants, of whom 52 participants were randomly assigned; 25 to receive active NMES and 27 to placebo NMES. Change in 6MWT distance was greater in the active NMES group (mean 29·9 [95% CI 8·9 to 51·0]) compared with in the placebo group (−5·7 [–19·9 to 8·4]; mean difference at 6 weeks 35·7 m [95% CI 10·5 to 60·9]; p=0·005). Sensitivity analyses for complete-cases and adjustment for baseline values showed similar results. 6 weeks after stopping the intervention the effect waned (7·3 m [95% CI −32·5 to 47·0]; p=0·50). The proportion of participants who had adverse events was similar between groups (five [20%] in the active NMES group and nine [33%] in the placebo group). Two participants, one from each group, reported persistent erythema, which was considered to be possibly related to NMES and the use of adhesive electrodes.
Interpretation
NMES improves functional exercise capacity in patients with severe COPD by enhancing quadriceps muscle mass and function. These data support the use of NMES in the management of patients unable to engage with conventional pulmonary rehabilitation. More work is needed to study how to maintain the effect.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Effective targeted therapy for sepsis requires an understanding of the heterogeneity in the individual host response to infection. We investigated this heterogeneity by defining interindividual variation in the transcriptome of patients with sepsis and related this to outcome and genetic diversity.
Methods
We assayed peripheral blood leucocyte global gene expression for a prospective discovery cohort of 265 adult patients admitted to UK intensive care units with sepsis due to community-acquired pneumonia and evidence of organ dysfunction. We then validated our findings in a replication cohort consisting of a further 106 patients. We mapped genomic determinants of variation in gene transcription between patients as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL).
Findings
We discovered that following admission to intensive care, transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood leucocytes defines two distinct sepsis response signatures (SRS1 and SRS2). The presence of SRS1 (detected in 108 [41%] patients in discovery cohort) identifies individuals with an immunosuppressed phenotype that included features of endotoxin tolerance, T-cell exhaustion, and downregulation of human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class II. SRS1 was associated with higher 14 day mortality than was SRS2 (discovery cohort hazard ratio (HR) 2·4, 95% CI 1·3–4·5, p=0·005; validation cohort HR 2·8, 95% CI 1·5–5·1, p=0·0007). We found that a predictive set of seven genes enabled the classification of patients as SRS1 or SRS2. We identified cis-acting and trans-acting eQTL for key immune and metabolic response genes and sepsis response networks. Sepsis eQTL were enriched in endotoxin-induced epigenetic marks and modulated the individual host response to sepsis, including effects specific to SRS group. We identified regulatory genetic variants involving key mediators of gene networks implicated in the hypoxic response and the switch to glycolysis that occurs in sepsis, including HIF1α and mTOR, and mediators of endotoxin tolerance, T-cell activation, and viral defence.
Interpretation
Our integrated genomics approach advances understanding of heterogeneity in sepsis by defining subgroups of patients with different immune response states and prognoses, as well as revealing the role of underlying genetic variation. Our findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of sepsis and create opportunities for a precision medicine approach to enable targeted therapeutic intervention to improve sepsis outcomes.

Background
Delirium is common in mechanically ventilated patients and is associated with cognitive impairment lasting at least 1 year after hospital discharge. Preclinical and observational studies suggest that the use of statins might reduce delirium in intensive care. We assessed whether the pleiotropic effects of statins can reduce delirium in intensive care and decrease subsequent cognitive impairment in a randomised controlled trial.
Methods
We did this ancillary study within the SAILS trial, a randomised controlled trial assessing mortality and ventilator-free days for rosuvastatin versus placebo for patients with sepsis-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome. This study was done at 35 hospitals in the USA. Patients were randomly assigned in permuted blocks of eight and stratified by hospital to receive either rosuvastatin (40 mg loading dose and then 20 mg daily until the earliest of 3 days after discharge from intensive care, study day 28, or death) or placebo. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. Delirium was assessed with the validated Confusion Assessment Method for intensive care. Cognitive function was assessed with tests for executive function, language, verbal reasoning and concept formation, and working, immediate, and delayed memory. We defined cognitive impairment as having one of these domains at least two SDs below population norms or at least two domains at least 1·5 SDs below norms. The primary endpoint was daily delirium status in intensive care up to 28 days in the intention-to-treat population and secondary endpoints were cognitive function at 6 months and 12 months. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00979121 and NCT00719446).
Findings
272 patients were assessed for delirium daily in intensive care. The mean proportion of days with delirium was 34% (SD 30%) in the rosuvastatin group versus 31% (29%) in the placebo group; hazard ratio 1·14, 95% CI 0·92–1·41, p=0·22. At 6 months, 19 (36%) of 53 patients in the rosuvastatin group versus 29 (38%) of 77 in the placebo group had cognitive impairment, with no significant difference between groups (treatment effect 0·93, 95% CI 0·39–2·22; p=0·87). At 12 months, 20 (30%) of 67 patients versus 23 (28%) of 81 patients had cognitive impairment, with no significant difference between groups (treatment effect 1·1, 95% CI 0·5–2·6; p=0·82).
Interpretation
Most patients had delirium, with around a third of survivors having cognitive impairment over 1 year of follow-up. Despite encouraging preclinical and observational studies, this trial shows no benefit of rosuvastatin in reducing delirium in intensive care or cognitive impairment during 12 months of follow-up although the study was not powered for superiority. Thus, there is continued need to evaluate interventions aimed at attenuating intensive care and post-intensive-care cognitive impairments commonly observed in this population.

abstract = "Summary
CT imaging is a readily quantifiable tool that can provide in-vivo assessments of lung structure in conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The information extracted from these data has been used in many clinical, epidemiological, and genetic investigations for patient stratification and prognostication, and to determine intermediate endpoints for clinical trials. Although these efforts have informed our understanding of the heterogeneity of pulmonary disease in smokers, they have not yet translated into new treatments for COPD or the personalisation of patient care. There are a multitude of potential reasons for this, including the lack of insight that static imaging provides for lung function and dysfunction, the limited resolution of clinical CT scanning for microscopic changes to the lung architecture, and the challenges that the biomedical community faces when trying to translate discovery to therapy. Such limitations might be addressed through novel image analysis techniques, up-and-coming CT-based and MRI-based technologies, closer ties between academia and industry, and an expanded endeavour to share data across the biomedical community."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Slow and cumbersome laboratory diagnostics for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) risk delayed treatment and poor patient outcomes. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) could potentially provide a rapid and comprehensive diagnostic solution. In this prospective study, we compare real-time WGS with routine MTBC diagnostic workflows.
Methods
We compared sequencing mycobacteria from all newly positive liquid cultures with routine laboratory diagnostic workflows across eight laboratories in Europe and North America for diagnostic accuracy, processing times, and cost between Sept 6, 2013, and April 14, 2014. We sequenced specimens once using local Illumina MiSeq platforms and processed data centrally using a semi-automated bioinformatics pipeline. We identified species or complex using gene presence or absence, predicted drug susceptibilities from resistance-conferring mutations identified from reference-mapped MTBC genomes, and calculated genetic distance to previously sequenced UK MTBC isolates to detect outbreaks. WGS data processing and analysis was done by staff masked to routine reference laboratory and clinical results. We also did a microcosting analysis to assess the financial viability of WGS-based diagnostics.
Findings
Compared with routine results, WGS predicted species with 93% (95% CI 90–96; 322 of 345 specimens; 356 mycobacteria specimens submitted) accuracy and drug susceptibility also with 93% (91–95; 628 of 672 specimens; 168 MTBC specimens identified) accuracy, with one sequencing attempt. WGS linked 15 (16% [95% CI 10–26]) of 91 UK patients to an outbreak. WGS diagnosed a case of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis before routine diagnosis was completed and discovered a new multidrug-resistant tuberculosis cluster. Full WGS diagnostics could be generated in a median of 9 days (IQR 6–10), a median of 21 days (IQR 14–32) faster than final reference laboratory reports were produced (median of 31 days [IQR 21–44]), at a cost of £481 per culture-positive specimen, whereas routine diagnosis costs £518, equating to a WGS-based diagnosis cost that is 7% cheaper annually than are present diagnostic workflows.
Interpretation
We have shown that WGS has a scalable, rapid turnaround, and is a financially feasible method for full MTBC diagnostics. Continued improvements to mycobacterial processing, bioinformatics, and analysis will improve the accuracy, speed, and scope of WGS-based diagnosis.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Lung volume reduction of emphysematous lobes results in clinical improvement for patients with severe emphysema. However, some segments within a lobe are often substantially more diseased than others, thereby warranting a more targeted approach of the emphysematous parts of a lobe. We therefore did a study to assess whether or not selective sequential treatment of the more diseased upper lobe segments with bronchoscopic vapour ablation led to clinical improvement.
Methods
For the multicentre, parallel-group, randomised, controlled, open-label Sequential Staged Treatment of Emphysema with Upper Lobe Predominance (STEP-UP) trial, adult patients aged 45–75 years with severe, upper lobe-predominant emphysema with a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) between 20% and 45%, substantial hyperinflation, and post-rehabilitation 6-min walk test (6MWT) greater than 140 m were enrolled from 13 hospital sites in Europe (ten sites) and Australia (three sites). A computer-generated blocked randomisation scheme (block size three per site based on a random table from an independent biostatistician) stratified by site was used to randomly assign enrolled patients 2:1 to segmental vapour ablation (treatment group) or standard medical management (control group). Patients and investigators were not masked to group assignment. The primary efficacy endpoints were statistically significant changes in FEV1 and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ-C) scores between trial groups at 6 months, analysed by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01719263.
Findings
Between June 30, 2013, and Oct 1, 2014, 134 patients were screened and 70 were enrolled and randomly assigned: 46 to the treatment group and 24 to the control group. One patient in the treatment group did not receive treatment because of physician decision post-randomisation; this patient is excluded from all analyses. The mean relative improvement in FEV1 between the treatment group versus the control group was 14·7% (95% CI 7·8–21·5%; p<0·0001) and in SGRQ-C was −9·7 points (95% CI −15·7 to −3·7; p=0·0021). COPD exacerbation was the most common serious adverse event, occurring in 11 (24%) of 45 patients in the treatment group and one (4%) of 24 in the control group. One exacerbation resulted in a patient death 84 days after treatment; this was judged by the data and safety monitoring board to be possibly related to treatment. No pneumothorax occurred within 30 days of treatment.
Interpretation
Compared with standard medical management, targeted thermal vapour ablation of more diseased segments and preservation of less diseased segments resulted in clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in lung function and quality of life at 6 months, with an acceptable safety profile.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a chronic disease associated with poor long-term outcomes. Identifying predictors of long-term outcome in pulmonary arterial hypertension is important to assess disease severity and guide treatment. We investigate associations between efficacy parameters and long-term outcomes in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension receiving riociguat in the PATENT-2 study. We also present safety and efficacy data from the final data cutoff of PATENT-2, where most patients had received at least 2 years of riociguat treatment.
Methods
Eligible patients from the PATENT-1 study entered the PATENT-2 open-label extension, which will continue until all patients transition to the commercial drug. All patients received riociguat individually adjusted to a maximum dose of 2·5 mg three times a day. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability, assessed with recording adverse events, serious adverse events, discontinuations, and deaths; exploratory assessments included 6-min walking distance (6MWD), WHO functional class, N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)concentrations, Borg dyspnoea score, health-related quality of life (EQ-5D score), survival, and clinical worsening-free survival. Association between efficacy parameters and long-term outcomes was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analyses and a Cox proportional-hazards regression model. PATENT-2 is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00863681.
Findings
396 patients entered PATENT-2, of whom 197 patients were receiving riociguat monotherapy and 199 were receiving riociguat in combination with endothelin receptor antagonists or prostanoids, or both. A significant association was noted between 6MWD, NT-proBNP concentration, and WHO functional class and overall survival at baseline (p=0·0006, 0·0225, and 0·0191, respectively), and at follow-up (p=0·021, 0·0056, and 0·0048, respectively). Riociguat was well tolerated in PATENT-2. Serious adverse events were recorded in 238 (60%) of the total population, and 45 (11%) patients discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. Improvements in 6MWD, WHO functional class, and NT-proBNP concentrations were maintained after 2 years of treatment.
Interpretation
These results support the long-term use of riociguat in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, and emphasise the prognostic value of 6MWD, WHO functional class, and NT-proBNP concentrations.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cardiovascular disease often coexist, and acute cardiac events frequently occur during COPD exacerbations. Even when cardiac complications are not clinically apparent, biochemical evidence of cardiac dysfunction is often noted during exacerbations and portends poor prognosis. Diagnosis of cardiac disease in COPD can be difficult and necessitates a high degree of clinical suspicion. However, the additional strain of an exacerbation could be a pivotal moment, during which previously unsuspected cardiac dysfunction is exposed. In this Review, we present evidence about cardiac involvement in exacerbations of COPD, and discuss diagnostic challenges and treatment opportunities."

abstract = "Summary
Sepsis is a common complication in patients in intensive care units and a frequent reason for intensive care unit admission. Sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and, without specific antisepsis therapies, management relies on infection control and organ support. For these interventions to be most effective, they must be started early, which highlights the need for all health-care workers to be aware of sepsis so that diagnosis can be made as early as possible. In this Viewpoint, we discuss some of the earlier terms used to characterise and define sepsis, and point out some of their limitations. We then introduce some aspects of new consensus definitions, proposed by an expert panel, which highlight in particular the importance of organ dysfunction. These definitions should help provide a more standardised approach to the identification of patients with suspected sepsis in both clinical practice and clinical research."
