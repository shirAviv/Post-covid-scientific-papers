abstract = "Background and aim
Adipocytokine dysfunction is considered as causative factor of target organ damage in metabolic disease. The aim of the study was to investigate whether altered adipocytokine profile predicts left ventricular (LV) remodeling in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Methods
A total of 186 patients (125 hypertensive and 61 non-hypertensive individuals) with established T2DM and 20 healthy volunteers were enrolled in the study. LV remodeling was determined at baseline. Concentrations of adipocytokines were measured with ELISA at baseline.
Results
The most important predictors of LV hypertrophy in T2DM patients were serum levels of omentin-1 (B-coefficient = −0.64, p = 0.001), Zinc-α2-glycoprotein [ZA2G] (B-coefficient = −0.57, p = 0.002), visfatin (B-coefficient = 0.26, p = 0.034), hs-CRP (B-coefficient = 0.38, p = 0.002), HOMA-IR (B-coefficient = 0.34, p = 0.001), age (B-coefficient = 0.31, p = 0.022), glypican-4 (B-coefficient = −0.23, p = 0.042), and male sex (B-coefficient = 0.11, p = 0.048). After entering combined depending variable (LV hypertrophy and LV diastolic dysfunction) to the model the significant predictors remained serum levels of omentin-1 (B-coefficient = −0.82, p = 0.001), ZA2G (B-coefficient = −0.54, p = 0.001) and HOMA-IR (B-coefficient = 0.44, p = 0.001). Regression analyses showed that the most influential determinants of depending variable (LV hypertrophy + LV diastolic dysfunction) in T2DM patients were omentin-1 (B-coefficient = −1.6, p = 0.001) and ZA2G (B-coefficient = −0.78, p = 0.044).
Conclusion
We found that serum levels of omentin-1 and ZA2G were the most important predictors for LV hypertrophy + LV diastolic dysfunction in T2DM patients. Large clinical trials are required to confirm this assumption and get clear explanation of issues unveiled."

India has the second largest number of patients with diabetes, and research to contain it and limit its complications is needed.
Methods
A literature search was done using Pubmed and Google Scholar search engines to prepare a narrative review on this topic.
Results
India’s contribution to research on diabetes remains inadequate, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Most of the work thus far has been done by a limited number of organisations and individuals, and has been confined to certain limited areas of interest. Nearly 40% of the publications on diabetes in India between 2000 and 2009 originated from just 20 institutions. Many important aspects of diabetes in India remain uninvestigated. In this review we make an attempt to evaluate the current status of diabetes research in India and to understand the hurdles dissuading a large proportion of healthcare professionals in India from embarking on a career in research. We also suggest solutions for overcoming these hurdles.
Conclusions
Considering the major health and economic problems posed by the unrestrained diabetes epidemic in India, research in this area remains highly inadequate."

abstract = "The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak once again demonstrated the importance of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in patients with diabetes. Activation of the RAS increases in patients with diabetes. The virus attaches to the ACE2 enzyme at low cytosolic pH values and enters into the cell and causes infection. Especially in the presence of diabetes mellitus and accompanying comorbid conditions such as hypertension, obesity, old age, and smoking, cytosolic pH is low, thus the virus easily may enter the cell by attaching to ACE2. ACEIs and ARBs lead to a reduction in angiotensin II level by increasing the ACE2 level, thus they cause a low cytosolic pH. Increased cardiac ACE2 levels due to ACEIs and ARBs can trigger cardiac arrhythmias and myocarditis by causing the virus to easily enter the heart tissue. There is ACE2 activity in the rostral ventrolateral medulla in the brain stem. The release of angiotensin 1-7 in the brain stem leads to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. This activation causes systemic vasoconstriction and the patient’s blood pressure increases. The most important event is the increased sympathetic activity via the central stimulation, this activity increases pulmonary capillary leaking, causing the ARDS. As the cytosolic pH, which is already low in patients with diabetes will decrease further with the mechanisms mentioned above, the viral load will increase and the infection will be exacerbated. As a result, the use of ACEIs and ARBs in patients with diabetes can lead to increased morbidity and mortality of COVID-19."

abstract = "Background and aims
Type 2 diabetes confers a differential risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease according to the gender. Whether newly approved anti-diabetic drugs like sodium-glucose co-transport-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2Is) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) that have shown a significant reduction in the CV end-points in CV outcome trials (CVOTs) also have a differential impact gender-wise, is still not clearly known.
Methods
We systematically searched the medical database up to December 31, 2019 and retrieved all the dedicated CVOTs conducted with SGLT-2Is and GLP-1RAs that explicitly reported the outcome of major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Subsequently, we pooled the hazard ratio (HR) of MACE in both sexes separately and meta-analyzed the result gender-wise.
Results
The meta-analysis of three CVOTs conducted with SGLT-2Is (N = 34,322), demonstrated a significant reduction in MACE in men but not in women (Men - HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.83 to 0.97; P = 0.006; Women - HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.00; P = 0.06) compared to placebo. The meta-analysis of seven CVOTs conducted with GLP-1RAs (N = 56,004) demonstrated a significant reduction in MACE in both sex (Men - HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82 to 0.93; P < 0.0001; Women - HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.99; P = 0.03), against the placebo.
Conclusions
The reduction in MACE with SGLT-2Is appears to be significantly less in women with diabetes vs men, while GLP-1RAs confers a similar reduction in MACE, irrespective of the gender. Whether these results are related to inadequate statistical power (underrepresentation of women) in CVOT, or it reflects a true gender difference, still remains to be established."

and Aims: No valid treatment or preventative strategy has evolved till date to counter the SARS CoV 2 (Novel Coronavirus) epidemic that originated in China in late 2019 and have since wrought havoc on millions across the world with illness, socioeconomic recession and death. This analysis was aimed at tracing a trend related to death counts expected at the 5th and 6th week of the COVID-19 in India.
Material and methods
Validated database was used to procure global and Indian data related to coronavirus and related outcomes. Multiple regression and linear regression analyses were used interchangeably. Since the week 6 death count data was not correlated significantly with any of the chosen inputs, an auto-regression technique was employed to improve the predictive ability of the regression model.
Results
A linear regression analysis predicted average week 5 death count to be 211 with a 95% CI: 1.31–2.60). Similarly, week 6 death count, in spite of a strong correlation with input variables, did not pass the test of statistical significance. Using auto-regression technique and using week 5 death count as input the linear regression model predicted week 6 death count in India to be 467, while keeping at the back of our mind the risk of over-estimation by most of the risk-based models.
Conclusion
According to our analysis, if situation continue in present state; projected death rate (n) is 211 and467 at the end of the 5th and 6th week from now, respectively."

Older adults and people who have cardiovascular disorders (their common pathogenetic mechanism is progressive atherosclerosis) are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). Their common pathogenetic mechanism is progressive atherosclerosis in which oxLDL (oxidized LDL) plays major role. Receptor-mediated uptake of oxLDL by the monocyte-derived macrophages activates the long-term epigenetic reprogramming of innate immunity, which is termed “trained immunity.” The aim of this work is to investigate the mechanisms and treatment possibilities that can control the activities of these specific macrophages.
Methods
Search in Medline and PubMed relevant articles on the trained immunity and cytokine storm of COVID-19.
Results and Conclusions
When oxLDL-trained macrophages encounter SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) in the lung, it causes unregulated cytokine secretion, leading to the alveolar damage. Therefore, blocking macrophage training by pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, could control the hyperactivation that the virus would trigger."

Several studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) from the United States and European countries have demonstrated a higher risk of morbidity and mortality than those without T2DM following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The data from Indian patients are scarce. Therefore, this study was carried out to focus on immediate postoperative complications following CABG in Indian patients.
Methods
Eighteen hundred consecutive patients who underwent elective CABG were included. Following exclusion criteria, a total of 1017 subjects were included for final analysis. 692 (68%) patients had T2DM and 325 (32%) patients had no T2DM. Data were obtained by collecting clinical data, routine biochemistry and chest imaging. Patients were followed up to 7 days postoperatively.
Results
At baseline, hypertension, triple vessel coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease and peripheral vascular disease were more common in patients with T2DM. Intraoperatively, use of blood products and intra-aortic balloon pump were more common in T2DM patients. Postoperatively, 13.2% patients with T2DM developed acute kidney injury versus 5.3% in non-T2DM group. Requirement of dialysis was not different between groups (P = 0.394). Pneumonia occurred in 2 patients in both groups (P = 0.370). Catheter-associated urinary tract infections were similar in two groups (P = 0.507). Mortality occurred only in one T2DM patient and none in non-T2DM group (P = 0.618).
Conclusions
A significant number of patients with T2DM developed acute kidney injury following CABG. There was no difference in infective complications such as pneumonia and catheter-associated urinary tract infection, between the two groups."

Eligibility criteria were cross-sectional, cohort or case-control observational studies that assessed the association between reduced magnesium levels and poor glycemic control and/or complications in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.
Results
Nine articles were included in the systematic review and two in the meta-analysis, all articles being cross-sectional. Among the seven studies that were designed to evaluate glycemic control, five showed an association between reduced levels of magnesium and poor glycemic control, and these findings were corroborated by the meta-analysis. Among the two studies in which dyslipidemia was evaluated, both showed higher levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, and lower levels of HDL cholesterol in patients with lower levels of magnesium as compared to those with higher magnesium levels. The three studies that evaluated diabetes kidney disease and the two studies that evaluated diabetic retinopathy found divergent results.

Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been widely evaluated as a biomarker in various medical and surgical prognoses, but its usefulness in diabetic kidney disease is not yet known.
Methods
This prospective observational study included outpatients, comprised of 184 men aged 73 ± 11 (mean ± standard deviation) years and 174 women aged 76 ± 10 years at baseline, from a rural hospital. We examined the relationship between baseline NLR calculated by analyzing the differential leukocyte counts in the complete blood count and the 2-year estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline rate (i.e. 2-year eGFR−baseline eGFR) ∗100/baseline eGFR. Rapid eGFR decline rate was defined as a value < -25%.
Results
Multiple linear regression analysis using rapid eGFR decline rates as objective variables, adjusted for confounding factors as explanatory variables, showed that NLR (β = 0.138, p = 0.007) as well as presence of antidyslipidemic medication, hemoglobinA1c, and urinary albumin excretion stage were significantly and independently associated with a rapid eGFR decline rate. The multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of the 2nd and 3rd tertiles of baseline NLR for rapid eGFR decline rate were 3.62 (0.70–18.7) and 8.03 (1.54–41.9), respectively. Multivariate-adjusted mean eGFR (95% confidence interval) values after 2 years categorized by tertile of baseline NLR were: 1st, 63.9 (61.8–66.1); 2nd, 60.8 (58.7–62.9); and 3rd, 58.9 (56.8–61.0).

As on date, no specific treatment is available for devastating COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. This pandemic viral infection has affected over 200 countries within a very short time and created a calamitous situation across the globe. As per WHO guidelines, the treatment is mainly symptomatic and supportive. This clinical protocol has not proven sufficient to save the lives of COVID-19 patients suffering from diabetes or having underlying liver diseases; hence there is utmost need to tackle this situation by other means such as Convalescent Plasma (CP) therapy.
Methods
A comprehensive literature survey was carriedout using Elsevier, PubMed, Taylor & Francis, Springer, Nature and Google search engines.
Results
The patients suffering from diabetes or liver dysfunction or any other underlying diseases are at greatest risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. From the study, it is proved that plasma collected from the recovered patients of viral infection has considerable potential to treat the viral disease without the occurrence of adverse effects.
Conclusion
The CP therapy can be a possible life saving alternative to treat critical COVID-19 patients having diabetes or underlying liver dysfunction. Hence, randomised clinical trials are recommended at the earliest to save the lives of infected individuals of COVID-19."

To compare the strength of associations between surrogate indexes of insulin resistance (sIR) and risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in non-Hispanic White (NHW), non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and Mexican American (MA) adults.
Methods
The 2013–2016 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data (n = 3435) were used for this study. The associations between sIR that includes Triglyceride/HDL cholesterol ratio (TG/HDL-C), triglyceride glucose (TG) index, visceral adiposity index (VAI), lipid accumulation product (LAP), TG-body mass index (TG-BMI), and TG-waist circumference (TG-WC) and risk for MetS were determined using the prevalence odds ratio (OR) from the logistic regression analyses. Pseudo-R-squared tests were used to estimate the proportion of variance in MetS accounted for by each sIR. Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian Information Criterion from the multinomial logistic regression analysis were used to compare models that included each sIR and its components separately as predictors of MetS. Areas under curves (AUC) from the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) were used to detect their diagnostic capabilities.
Results
Compared with other sIR, TG-WC (AUC = 0.899; 95% CI: 0.884–0.913 in NHW) and (AUC = 0.893; 95% CI:0.871–0.915 in NHB), and LAP (AUC = 877; 95% CI: 0.861–0.894 in MA) exhibited the highest diagnostic and predictive accuracy for MetS. Compared with other sIR, TG-WC (OR = 22.8; 95% CI:16.6–31.0 in NHW) and (OR = 22.7; 95% CI:13.1–39.3 in NHB), and LAP (OR = 10.6; 95%:6.6–17.0 in MA) were most significantly associated with increased odds of MetS, adjusting for eGFR, age, marital status, CHD, CHF, income, education, physical activity, alcohol use, smoking and use of cholesterol-lowering medication.
Conclusions
TG-WC in NHW and NHB, and LAP in MA are more powerful than other proxies of IR in predicting MetS. TG-WC and LAP can serve as adjunctive tools for screening for MetS in NHW, NHB, and MA."

Complete data were available for 348,598 UK Biobank participants. Of these, 449 had confirmed COVID-19 infection. Vitamin D was associated with COVID-19 infection univariably (OR = 0.99; 95% CI 0.99–0.999; p = 0.013), but not after adjustment for confounders (OR = 1.00; 95% CI = 0.998–1.01; p = 0.208). Ethnicity was associated with COVID-19 infection univariably (blacks versus whites OR = 5.32, 95% CI = 3.68–7.70, p-value<0.001; South Asians versus whites OR = 2.65, 95% CI = 1.65–4.25, p-value<0.001). Adjustment for 25(OH)D concentration made little difference to the magnitude of the association.
Conclusions
Our findings do not support a potential link between vitamin D concentrations and risk of COVID-19 infection, nor that vitamin D concentration may explain ethnic differences in COVID-19 infection."

abstract = "Background and aims
The outbreak of the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, causes a respiratory disease and individuals with pre-existing cardiometabolic disorders display worse prognosis through the infection course. The aim of this minireview is to present epidemiological data related to metabolic comorbidities in association with the SARS-CoV-2.
Methods
This is a narrative mini-review with Pubmed search until April 23, 2020 using the keywords COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, treatment of coronavirus and following terms: diabetes mellitus, obesity, arterial hypertension, ACE-inhibitors, cytokine storm, immune response and vitamin D.
Results
Studies indicate that obese individuals are more likely to develop infections, and that adipose tissue serves as a pathogen reservoir. In diabetic individuals higher rate of inflammatory processes is seen due to constant glucose recognition by C type lectin receptors. Hypertensive individuals, usually grouped with other conditions, are treated with drugs to reduce blood pressure mostly through ACEi and ARB, that leads to increased ACE2 expression, used by SARS-CoV-2 for human’s cell entry. Until now, the studies have shown that individuals with those conditions and affected by COVID-19 present an uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an unbalanced immune response, leading to the cytokine storm phenomenon. Vitamin D is highlighted as a potential therapeutic target, because in addition to acting on the immune system, it plays an important role in the control of cardiometabolic diseases.
Conclusion
Currently, since there is no proven and effective antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2, the efforts should focus on controlling inflammatory response and reduce the risks of associated complications."

Background and aims
COVID-19 is an emerging pandemic due to droplet infection of 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Due to its rapid transmission and high case-fatality rate, recognition of its risk and prognostic factor is important. Obesity has been associated with impaired immune system, increasing the susceptibility for 2019-nCoV infection. We aimed to study the impact of obesity to the prognosis and disease severity of COVID-19.
Methods
A systematic search and handsearching was conducted in four databases: Cochrane, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed. The identified articles were screened using the chosen eligibility criteria. We obtained three retrospective cohort studies (Wu J et al., Lighter J et al., and Simonnet A et al.) to be critically appraised using Newcastle Ottawa Scale.
Results
The findings of all included studies were consistent in stating the contribution of obesity as a risk factor to increase the requirement for advanced medical care. Study with the highest quality, Simonnet A et al., reported an increase need of invasive mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients with body mass index higher than 35 kg/m2, OR: 7.36 (1.63–33.14; p = 0.021). This is associated with a higher mortality rate in obese population infected with COVID-19.
Conclusion
Obesity is an independent risk and prognostic factor for the disease severity and the requirement of advanced medical care in COVID-19. This systematic review highlights a particularly vulnerable group – obese, and emphasises on the importance of treatment aggression and disease prevention in this population group."

Previous studies have indicated controversial results regarding the efficacy of green tea extract (GTE) in improving the lipid profile of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to pool data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
Methods
A systematic search was performed in Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus databases, without any language and time restriction until August 2019, to retrieve the RCTs which examined the effects of GTE on serum concentrations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglyceride (TG) or total cholesterol (TC) in T2DM patients. Meta-analyses were carried out using a random effects model. I2 index was used to evaluate the heterogeneity.
Results
Initial search yielded 780 publications. Of these, seven studies were eligible. The supplementary intake of GTE improved lipid profile by reducing serum TG concentrations in patients with T2DM. Meanwhile, subgroup analyses based on duration of interventions (≤8 and > 8 weeks) and intervention dosage (≤800 and > 800 mg/day) showed that the GTE supplementation longer than 8 weeks and in doses >800 mg/day resulted in a significant decrease in serum TG concentrations. Furthermore, intervention longer than 8 weeks with doses lower than 800 mg/day resulted in a significant reduction in serum TC concentrations.
Conclusion
In conclusion, present systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that the supplementary intake of GTE may improve lipid profile by reducing serum concentrations of TG in patients with T2DM. Furthermore, the results of our stratified analyses suggested that long-term GTE intervention may reduce serum concentrations of TG and TC."

To evaluate the association between elevated serum transaminase levels and insulin resistance (IR) in a population of healthy individuals.
Methods
We define IR with a cut-off point of homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) ≥ 3.8. For aspartate aminotransferase (AST), we consider elevated values >30 U/L in women and values >36 U/L in men. For alanine aminotransferase (ALT), we consider elevated values >30 U/L in women and values >40 U/L in men. We performed a crude and adjusted generalized linear model from Poisson family with robust variance, in order to evaluate the association between elevated serum transaminase levels and IR. The associations were presented as prevalence ratio (PR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
Results
We included 261 participants in the study. The median age was 39 years (31–45) and 23.7% of the participants were men. The prevalence of elevated serum transaminase for AST and ALT were, 13.8% and 26.1%, respectively. The prevalence of IR was 34.1%. In the crude analysis we found statistical significance between elevated AST and ALT with IR (PR = 3.18; 95% CI: 2.33–4.34 and PR = 2.44; 95% CI: 1.88–3.30; respectively). However, in the multivariate analysis, the association only remained statistically significance with ALT, but lost its significance with AST, PR = 1.90; CI 95%: 1.31–2.77 and a PR = 1.23; CI 95%: 0.93–1.61; respectively.

We performed a retrospective study of diabetic patients undergoing a targeted multimodal prehabilitation programme to assess changes in their diabetic control and functional capacity prior to surgery. As part of the programme, patients were encouraged to follow a low-carbohydrate, high-fat (LCHF) dietary approach. We aimed to assess the feasibility and effects of this programme on our cohort of patients.
Methods
From 79 patients attending prehabilitation, 17 (13 males, age (median [interquartile range]): 71 [63–79] years) had Type 2 diabetes and none had Type 1. Patients had undergone a targeted multimodal prehabilitation programme prior to surgery, which comprised supervised exercise sessions (aerobic or resistance training), nutritional education (LCHF suggestion, correct protein intake, and avoidance of processed food), psychological support and medical optimization. Weight, body mass index (BMI), glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting glucose, and functional capacity were measured prior to and after prehabilitation. Data were compared with a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
Results
There were significant improvements in HbA1c (P = 0.000), fasting glucose (P = 0.006), weight (P = 0.002), and BMI (P = 0.002). There were no significant improvements in functional capacity.
Conclusions
We have shown that in the preoperative period, a targeted multimodal prehabilitation programme incorporating a LCHF diet improves diabetes control in patients with T2D awaiting elective surgery. Our approach is novel as a LCHF diet has not previously been utilized in patients with diabetes within this context. Prospective studies are required in the context of post-operative outcomes."

20 articles were selected and studied based on eight theories which they used. These theories were: Social support theory, Health Belief Model, Heath Belief Model and Empowerment Theory, Empowerment Theory, Self-efficacy Theory, precede-proceed model, Self-regulation Theory, behavioral theory and Social Cognitive Theory.
Conclusion
Four theories appeared to be more effective for the target behavior of present research: Social Support Theory and the combination of Empowerment Theory and Health Belief Model, Social Cognitive Theory and Self Efficacy Theory. Taken together, the findings of this systematic review suggest that interventions that go beyond individual determinants (such as changing knowledge and attitudes) to determinants of upper cognitive, motor, and social levels (such as the development of skills and competencies) they have led to raised self-care outcomes."

Hypertension and diabetes are global health problems with an incidence that is rapidly increasing worldwide. Depression is the most frequent mental health co-morbidity and is considered an important risk factor for the development of both diseases. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with depression among Peruvian adults with hypertension and diabetes.
Methods
We performed a secondary analysis of the 2017 Peru Demographic and Family Health Survey, using data from 10,566 adults aged 40 and older. The main outcome was depression assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Other important variables were the diagnosis of hypertension or diabetes, sex, age, level of education, geographical region, wealth index, daily smoking, harmful alcohol consumption and physical disability.
Results
The overall prevalence of depression was 23.15% (CI 95%: 21.42%–24.88%) and among adults with hypertension and diabetes it was 34.96% (CI 95%: 29.33%–40.59%) and 35.56% (CI 95%: 24.49%–46.63%), respectively. Whereas the prevalence of depression among adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was higher in the physical disability group (PRa: 1.28; CI 95%: 1.12–1.45), the prevalence of depression among adults with hypertension was higher in the female group (PRa: 1.36; CI 95%: 1.20–1.54) and among those with harmful alcohol consumption (PRa: 1.50; CI 95%: 1.01–2.24).
Conclusion
Peru has a considerable burden of depression in the hypertensive and diabetic populations. While the variables positively associated with depression in hypertensive adults were female gender and harmful alcohol consumption, in adults with diabetes it was the presence of physical disability."

According to the World Obesity Federation, “obesity-related conditions seem to worsen the effect of Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2)”; additionally the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention reported that “people with heart disease and diabetes are at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 complications and that severe obesity poses a higher risk for severe illness”. Recent reports have shown elevated levels of cytokines due to increased inflammation in patients with SARS-CoV-2 disease. On the other hand, obesity represents a state of low-grade inflammation, with various inflammatory products directly excreted by adipose tissue. In this concise report we aimed to assess common elements of obesity and SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Methods

Results
We present “mechanistic” obesity-related problems that aggravate SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as tentative inflammatory/metabolic links between these diseases.

Periodontal Disease (PD) is associated with complications of diabetes. Control of the PD reduces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship of PD with duration, severity of diabetes and eGFR.
Material and method
A Prospective observational study conducted at Sidhi Vinayaka Hospitals (SVH) Sangareddy during the period of January 2014 to December 2019. Total 1436 patients with a definite diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), between the ages of 45–60 years were included. They were classified according to CPITN score for PD and compared against the variables.
Results
A total of 1436 consecutive outpatients attending to SVH were included. Among them 662 (46.1%) were males and 774(53.9%) were females. The mean age of the patients was 48.3(SD ± 10.62) and mean duration of diabetes was 2.9(SD ± 4.18). The mean fasting blood glucose was 198.5(SD ± 85), mean post prandial blood glucose was 277.2 (SD ± 107.7) and mean HBA1c was 9.98% (SD ± 2.6). Among the study group 1198 (83.4%) had none/mild (Grade I) PD, 192(13.4%) had moderate/severe (Grade II) PD and 46(3.2%) were completely edentulous (Grade III).
Conclusion
There is a linear correlation between PD and age of patient, duration of diabetes, eGFR and level of glycemic status among rural population with T2DM."

COVID-19 is a public world crisis, however, it is a self-limited infection. In COVID-19, the strength of immune and respiratory systems is a critical element. Thus, this review was conducted to demonstrate the short and long term effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on increasing the function and strength of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections and associated disorders.
Methods
This review was carried out by searching in Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, Medline databases. The search was conducted over clinical trials and literature and systematic reviews on the effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on the function and strength of specific immune and respiratory elements essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections.
Results
This review found that increasing the aerobic capacity could produce short-term safe improvements in the function of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those specific for COVID-19 infections. This could be mainly produced through three mechanisms. Firstly, it could improve immunity by increasing the level and function of immune cells and immunoglobulins, regulating CRP levels, and decreasing anxiety and depression. Secondly, it could improve respiratory system functions by acting as an antibiotic, antioxidant, and antimycotic, restoring normal lung tissue elasticity and strength. Lastly, it could act as a protective barrier to decrease COVID-19 risk factors, which helps to decrease the incidence and progression of COVID-19.
Conclusion
This review summarizes that increasing the aerobic capacity is recommended because it has potential of improving immune and respiratory functions which would help counter COVID-19."

abstract = "Background and Aims
There is inconsistent evidence supporting the self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in people with non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes (T2D). Structured SMBG protocols have a greater impact on glycaemic control than unstructured SMBG and may improve measures of glycaemic variability (GV), though few previous studies have reported on specific GV outcomes. Our aim was to determine the impact of structured SMBG on simple measures of GV in people with T2D.
Methods
Participants undertook structured SMBG over 12 months, with HbA1c recorded at baseline and at 3-monthly follow-up. For each participant, the mean blood glucose (MBG), fasting blood glucose (FBG), standard deviation BG (SD-BG), coefficient of variation of BG (CV-BG), mean absolute glucose change (MAG) and HbA1c were determined for each 3-month period. Responders were participants with an improvement in HbA1c of ≥5 mmol/mol (0.5%) over 12 months.
Results
Data from two hundred and thirty-one participants were included for analysis. Participants had a baseline median [interquartile range] HbA1c 68.0 [61.5–75.5] mmol/mol (8.4%). Participants demonstrated significant improvements in the MBG (−1.25 mmol/L), FBG (−0.97 mmol/L), SD-BG (−0.44 mmol/L), CV-BG (−1.43%), MAG (−0.97 mmol/L), and HbA1c (−7.0 mmol/mol) (all p < 0.001) at 12 months compared to these measures collected within the first 3 months of SMBG. Responders had a significantly higher baseline median [interquartile range] HbA1c of 70.0 [63.0–78.0] mmol/mol compared to 61.0 [56.5–66.0] mmol/mol in non-responders (P < 0.001).
Conclusions
Structured SMBG improved all the observed measures of GV. These results support the use of structured SMBG in people with non-insulin treated T2D."

Prior studies have shown that Helicobacter pylori (H. Pylori) has the important role in the development of gastrointestinal diseases and diabetes in patients with diabetes. Due to the contradictory results on the prevalence of H. pylori in patients, we carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to discover the pooled prevalence of H. Pylori in patients with diabetes.
Methods
A systematic literature search was performed utilizing international databases including Medline (PubMed), Web of sciences, Scopus, EMBASE, Cochrane, Ovid and CINHAL to retrieve all cross-sectional studies which had reported H. pylori prevalence in patients with diabetes between January 1990 and March 2019. The random effects models were applied to calculate the pooled prevalence with 95% confidence interval.
Results
A total of 13 articles were selected for meta-analysis according to PRISMA guideline. The pooled prevalence of H. Pylori was obtained 54% (95% CI: 44%–64%) in patients with diabetes. The highest and least prevalence of H. pylori were associated to Africa (66%; 95%CI: 49%–73%) and USA (15%; 95%CI: 8%−26%). In addition, the rapid urease test and biopsy/histology had the most strength in detecting of the H. pylori infection. The meta-regression analysis demonstrated that H. pylori prevalence is not affected by patients’ age, publication year, study duration, and HbA1C.
Conclusion
Given that the high prevalence of H. pylori in patients with diabetes and its important role in the development of gastrointestinal diseases and diabetes, treatment and eradication of this bacterium should be considered in patients with diabetes."

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the association of gravidity and age at first pregnancy with metabolic syndrome in a large-scale, population-based cohort study in Iran.
Methods
The present secondary analysis was conducted on a subset of the population (5739 women with at least one pregnancy) enrolled in the Tabari cohort study. Reproductive history was collected using a structured questionnaire. The relationship of gravidity and age at first pregnancy with metabolic syndrome and its components was analyzed using the logistic regression model.
Results
The results showed that after adjustment for confounding variables, the odds of having metabolic syndrome was not significantly associated with age at first pregnancy (P = 0.269) and gravidity (P = 0.504). However, there was an association between hypertension and age at first pregnancy (OR = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.12–0.82; P = 0.03). Additionally, waist circumference was also associated with gravidity (OR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.37–3.35).
Conclusion
As the findings indicated, age at first pregnancy and gravidity were not associated with the odds of having metabolic syndrome. However, a relationship was found between first pregnancy at the age of >35 years and the decreased risk of hypertension. Gravidity was also found to be a dose-dependent risk factor for increased waist circumference."

Given, that the modern world human population is constantly exposed to multiple stressors in the form of physical (i.e., sound, weather etc.) and chemical environment (i.e., diet, pollutants etc.), industrialization, and modernization has led to form a basis for exposomal correlation with T2DM incidence. Over the past decade, there have been emerging reports on association of levels of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), phthalates, antibiotics, drugs, air pollution, pesticides, and heavy metals with T2DM. In this review, we discuss the well known chemical exposome that has been associated with T2DM; the tools and approaches to capture this chemical exposome, and future opportunities and challenges in this exciting area of research. We further provide a window of thoughts, whether omics technologies can help fill in the gaps to help provide high throughput exposomics datasets in an unbiased manner to help understand T2DM pathophysiology in the context of industrialization, drastic lifestyle changes, urbanization, and pollution.

The present study aimed to evaluate the in vitro inhibitory effect of S. officinalis on key digestive enzymes linked to type 2 diabetes and to identify its hemolytic effect.
Methods
Hydro-methanol decoction extract and fractions of ethyl acetate and n-butanol were investigated for their in vitro α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities, compared to acarbose as a standard. Furthermore, they were evaluated for their hemolytic effect.
Results
Phytochemical composition demonstrated the richness of S. officinalis in secondary metabolites. Extract and fractions inhibited the activity of both enzymes. They showed weak hemolytic activity. Quantitative estimation of total phenolic and flavonoids revealed that ethyl acetate fraction contained the highest amount of these compounds (450.51 ± 0.6 μg GAE/mg DE and 352.01 ± 0.78 μg CE/mg of DE, respectively). It showed the best antidiabetic activity tested both by α-amylase and α-glucosidase assays (IC50 = 46.52 ± 2.68 and 104.58 ± 0.06 μg/mL, respectively). Moreover, this fraction showed the least hemolytic effect (11.58 ± 0.1%).

This study was designed to assess the achievement of a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) target in Iraqi type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients via retrospective analysis of a tertiary care database over a 9-year period.
Methods
A total of 12,869 patients with T2DM with mean (SEM) age: 51.4(0.1) years, and 54.4% were females registered into Faiha Specialized Diabetes, Endocrine and Metabolism Center(FDEMC) database between August 2008 and July 2017 were included in this retrospective study. Data were recorded for each patient during routine follow-up visits performed at the center every 3–12 months.
Results
Patients were under oral antidiabetic drugs (OAD; 45.8%) or insulin+ OAD (54.2%) therapy. Hypertension was evident in 42.0% of patients, while dyslipidemia was noted in 70.5%. Glycemic control (HbA1c <7%) was achieved by 13.8% of patients. Multivariate analysis revealed <55 years of age, female gender, >3 years duration of diabetes, HbA1c >10% at the first visit, presence of dyslipidemia, and insulin treatment as significant determinants of an increased risk of poor glycemic control. BMI <25 kg/m2 and presence of hypertension were associated with a decreased risk of poor glycemic control.
Conclusion
Using data from the largest cohort of T2DM patients from Iraq to date, this tertiary care database analysis over a 9-year period indicated poor glycemic control. Younger patient age, female gender, longer disease duration, initially high HbA1c levels, dyslipidemia, insulin treatment, overweight and obesity, and lack of hypertension were associated with an increased risk of poor glycemic control in Iraqi T2DM patients."

Retarding the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection by preventive strategies is the first line of management. Several countries have declared a stringent lockdown in order to enforce social distancing and prevent the spread of infection. This analysis was conducted in an attempt to understand the impact of lockdown on infection and death rates over a period of time in countries with declared lock-down.
Material and methods
A validated database was used to generate data related to countries with declared lockdown. Simple regression analysis was conducted to assess the rate of change in infection and death rates. Subsequently, a k-means and hierarchical cluster analysis was done to identify the countries that performed similarly. Sweden and South Korea were included as counties without lockdown in a second-phase cluster analysis.
Results
There was a significant 61% and 43% reduction in infection rates 1-week post lockdown in the overall and India cohorts, respectively, supporting its effectiveness. Countries with higher baseline infections and deaths (Spain, Germany, Italy, UK, and France-cluster 1) fared poorly compared to those who declared lockdown early on (Belgium, Austria, New Zealand, India, Hungary, Poland and Malaysia-cluster 2). Sweden and South Korea, countries without lock-down, fared as good as the countries in cluster 2.
Conclusion
Lockdown has proven to be an effective strategy is slowing down the SARS-CoV-2 disease progression (infection rate and death) exponentially. The success story of non-lock-down countries (Sweden and South Korea) need to be explored in detail, to identify the variables responsible for the positive results."

abstract = "Background and aims
The primary approach for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) involves lifestyle modification and diet therapy along with pharmacologic interventions. Many patients are interested to identify nutritional supplements that may provide benefit in prevention and management of diabetes. However, the efficacy and safety of nutritional supplements such as chromium, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), vitamin D, zinc and magnesium in disease treatment is a worrying and controversial matter. In this narrative review, patients and health care providers are introduced to the effects of mentioned dietary supplements that may help in choosing or not choosing these supplements in treatment of diabetes.
Methods
This review was carried out using comprehensive and systematic literature reports on the dietary supplements in the management of diabetes. Empirical searches were conducted using Google Scholar, Science Direct and PubMed databases. Searches were also undertaken using keywords, in English, such as “chromium” OR “vitamin D” OR “omega-3 fatty acids” OR “zinc” OR “magnesium” in combination with “type 2 diabetes”.
Results
The available evidence is insufficient to create a definite conclusion that nutritional supplements including chromium, n-3 PUFAs, vitamin D, zinc and magnesium might be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of T2DM and therefore, the general recommendation to use these supplements in the management of diabetes cannot be justified. The results of most studies lack uniformity across multiple aspects, including different dose and formation of supplements, duration, and subjects under intervention.
Conclusions
There is a need for well-designed, high quality, large and long-term studies to strengthen the available evidence and ensure the safety and efficacy of products."

Specific amino acids have been linked to regulation of insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells; on the contrary, increased concentration of certain amino acids is associated with insulin resistance (IR) and development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Nowadays, urine as a biological sample has attracted more attention for diagnosis of disease for its special superiority; insufficient research in the study of urinary amino acid (UAA) pattern in patients with T2DM has led to the present study with the aim to determine the levels of UAAs, their excretory patterns and the association of UAA to plasma glucose and IR in patients with T2DM.
Methods
Quantification of total urinary amino acids was done spectrophotometrically and the patterns of amino acid excretion was elucidated by thin layer chromatography technique. Fasting blood samples were used for plasma glucose and insulin estimation by fully automated analyzer.
Result
The levels of UAA in patients with T2DM in comparison to healthy controls were higher (p < 0.0001). The frequency of urinary phenylalanine, arginine, tryptophan, tyrosine and cysteine were significantly higher in patients with T2DM than controls. There was also a strong positive correlation of UAA levels with blood glucose levels and HOMA–IR in patients with T2DM.
Conclusion
Our study has shown subtle abnormalities in UAA patterns in patients with T2DM. The measurement of UAA levels and excretory pattern can be used as an index of hyperglycemia and IR which could serve as an inexpensive and non-invasive marker for T2DM. More studies are required to confirm this association."

Diabetes mellitus is associated with a more severe course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor for host cell entry. We aimed to assess the interactions between antihyperglycemic drugs and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and their putative roles in COVID-19.
Methods
A literature search was performed using Pubmed to review the interrelationships between hyperglycemia, RAS and COVID-19, and the effects of antihyperglycemic medications.
Results
The RAS has an essential role in glucose homeostasis and may have a role in COVID-19-induced lung injury. Some antihyperglycemic medications modulate RAS and might hypothetically alleviate the deleterious effect of angiotensin II on lung injury. Furthermore, most antihyperglycemic medications showed anti-inflammatory effects in animal models of lung injury.
Conclusions
Some antihyperglycemic medications might have protective effects against COVID-19-induced lung injury. Early insulin therapy seems very promising in alleviating lung injury."

The varying views as to the usefulness of serum cystatin C (CysC) as an early marker of diabetic nephropathy (DN) prompted us to investigate existing literature to determine whether serum CysC can be used as an early marker of DN using a meta-analysis approach.
Materials and methods
Twelve studies written in English were retrieved from PubMed using various key search terms. Data were extracted from the included studies by two of the authors and was subjected to statistical analysis using Review Manager 5.3 and Meta-Essentials. Levels of serum CysC were compared between the study groups using the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI).
Results
Overall outcomes indicate that serum CysC levels are higher among those with microalbuminuria (MI) and macroalbuminuria (MA) than those in the control group (CN) and those with normoalbuminuria (NO). However, these findings were heterogeneous, which warranted an investigation using the Galbraith plot. Heterogeneity was either reduced or lost in the post-outlier outcomes indicating combinability of the studies.
Conclusion
Serum CysC is shown to be a superior biomarker in the early diagnosis of DN. However, further studies are still needed to verify our claims."

Objective: The present study aims to find out the underlying physiological domains for the phenotypic attribution of metabolic syndrome as documented in several studies. Methodology: Literature search was done using Google Scholar, PUBMED, Research Gate and manual searching to identify relevant studies of the selected topic. Conclusion: More than one physiological domain has been explored for the expression of metabolic syndrome explored in different studies. A reason for this disparity may be because most of explored factors are just mathematically significant but not biologically. Another reason may be the varied factor load concern. Therefore, a fixed factor load value is needed to be restricted for all studies across world."

Worldwide, lifestyle is a significant risk factor for diabetes. Lifestyle changes can lead to differences in the extent of risk of diabetes among women and men. Kerala, a state with one of the best health indicators in India, has a high prevalence of diabetes. This study aimed at comparing the variations in the risk factors for HBG and VHBG among adult women and men in Kerala.
Methods
Data from the fourth round of the National Family Health Survey (2015–16) used to examine the differences in the risk factors for HBG and VHBG in men and women aged 15–49 years. We used bivariate, multivariate and Population Attributable Risk (PAR) techniques for analysing the data.
Results
Bivariate results have shown the pattern of HBG and VHBG prevalence in women and men was same among all the age groups; however, men show a higher HBG and VHBG than women in all the age groups. Prevalence of HBG and VHBG was higher in women with a primary education, who were poor and not working as compared to their male counterparts. PARs results show that the prevalence of VHBG was higher among obese men and women as compared to normal men and underweight women. Prevalence of HBG was higher among men as compared to women due to alcohol use and weekly consumption of non-vegetarian food.
Conclusions
The study suggests that there is an urgent need for targeted intervention programs to address the problem of HBG and VHBG in both men and women in Kerala to control blood glucose levels."

Balanced nutrition which can help in maintaining immunity is essential for prevention and management of viral infections. While data regarding nutrition in coronavirus infection (COVID-19) are not available, in this review, we aimed to evaluate evidence from previous clinical trials that studied nutrition-based interventions for viral diseases (with special emphasis on respiratory infections), and summarise our observations.
Methods
A systematic search strategy was employed using keywords to search the literature in 3 key medical databases: PubMed®, Web of Science® and SciVerse Scopus®. Studies were considered eligible if they were controlled trials in humans, measuring immunological parameters, on viral and respiratory infections. Clinical trials on vitamins, minerals, nutraceuticals and probiotics were included.
Results
A total of 640 records were identified initially and 22 studies were included from other sources. After excluding duplicates and articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria, 43 studies were obtained (vitamins: 13; minerals: 8; nutraceuticals: 18 and probiotics: 4). Among vitamins, A and D showed a potential benefit, especially in deficient populations. Among trace elements, selenium and zinc have also shown favourable immune-modulatory effects in viral respiratory infections. Several nutraceuticals and probiotics may also have some role in enhancing immune functions. Micronutrients may be beneficial in nutritionally depleted elderly population.

Methods
An exploratory study involving 28 patients with nascent MetS and 20 matched controls. Metabolites were studied from early morning urine samples and assayed by the NIH Western Metabolomics Center using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry and were standardized to urine creatinine. All of the patients enrolled in the study had normal renal and hepatic function.
Results
Patients with MetS had statistically significant increases in overall waist circumference, blood pressure, glucose, HOMA-IR, HbA1C in comparison to the control group. Additionally, increases in IL-1b, IL-6, TLR-4, endotoxin, and leptin were also seen in the MetS group subjects compared to the control group. The concentrations of homoserine were significantly decreased 3-fold in patients with MetS in comparison to the matched controls, p = 0.0027. Furthermore, levels of homoserine were inversely correlated to multiple biomarkers of inflammation and cardio-metabolic risk factors such as HbA1C, blood pressure, TLR-4, leptin, endotoxin, and SAT secreted fetuin A. In addition, homoserine was positively correlated with lysine and NAT.

Low glycemic index diets seem to be potentially effective to improve glycemic control and reduce lipid profiles. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of a low glycemic index/high fat, high-calorie diet on glycemic status and lipid profiles of patients with cystic fibrosis.
Methods
In this randomized clinical trial, 44 children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis were randomized to receive for three months either a high fat, high-calorie diet (n = 22) or a low glycemic index/high fat, high-calorie diet (n = 22) with similar calorie and macronutrients composition. Patients in high fat, high-calorie diet arm were allowed to use all sources of carbohydrates with different glycaemic indices; whereas those in another arm consumed carbohydrates from low glycemic index sources. Serum levels of lipid profiles (triglyceride, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol), insulin, fasting blood glucose, and glycated hemoglobin were measured at baseline and after the intervention.
Results
Between-group differences were significant only for fasting blood glucose (P < 0.001). However, fasting blood glucose (P = 0.003) and glycated hemoglobin (P = 0.002) significantly decreased after the intervention in the low glycemic index group, while in another group a significant increase in fasting blood glucose (P = 0.038) and triglyceride (P = 0.004) was found. No significant within-group differences were observed in other variables in both groups.
Conclusions
It seems that adherence to a low glycemic index/high fat, high-calorie diet can improve glycemic indices in children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis compared to the high fat, high-calorie diet.

abstract = "Aims
Binge eating disorder (BED) is the most common eating disorder in the United States and Europe and is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Presence and severity of BED have been associated with worse metabolic control and greater BMI in T2D patients. Glucagon Like Peptide-1 (GLP1) receptors are present in central nervous system areas involved in appetite regulation and treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists modulates appetite and reward-related brain areas in humans. We evaluated the effects of treatment with dulaglutide on eating behavior in T2D outpatients with BED.
Methods
This was a pilot open label, prospective controlled study. Inclusion criteria were: Age ≤65, HbA1c between 7.5 and 9% on metformin therapy alone, normal renal function and diagnosis of BED. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either Dulaglutide 1,5 mg/sett or Gliclazide 60 mg for 12 weeks. We evaluated baseline binge eating scale score (BES), weight, BMI, percentage fat mass, HbA1c and their changes after treatment. A multivariate linear regression model was used to verify the association between Δ BES from baseline with Δ Hba1c and variation of anthropometric parameters after treatment.
Results
After 12 weeks patients treated with dulaglutide had grater reduction of binge eating behaviour (p < 0.0001), body weight (p < 0,0001), BMI (p < 0.0001), percentage fat mass (p < 0.0001) and HbA1c (p = 0.009) than patients treated with gliclazide. Reduction in BES was associated with reduction in body weight (p < 0.0001) and HbA1c (p = 0.033).
Conclusion
Dulaglutide treatment reduces binge eating behaviour in T2D patients with BED."

We evaluated glycaemic control at 2–4 (T1) and 5–11 (T2) months after initiation and at the last available visit (T3, 18 ± 4 months). We asked patients to fill in, at T0 and T2, two questionnaires based on the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire; and on the Hypoglycaemia Fear Survey. Glycaemic control improved, from 8.1 ± 1.3% at T0 to 7.8 ± 1.2% at T1 (p < 0.001) and remained unchanged after. Average number of controls increased from 3.2 ± 1.2 BGM to 7.7 ± 3.9 at T1 (p < 0.001). We observed a modest decrease in daily insulin doses. We evidenced an increase in mild hypoglycaemic events, especially in well-controlled subjects, but no increase of severe events. Satisfaction score improved from 30.5 ± 7.7 points to 38.3 ± 5.1 points (p = 0.018), was correlated with the reduction in and was higher in less controlled patients at inclusion. “Behaviour” score regarding hypoglycaemias decrease from 5.7 ± 4.1 to 4.4 ± 3.6 points (p < 0.001). In conclusion, this 18-months study trial indicates that using the FGM technology in patients with T1D may improve glycaemic control, in real-life conditions, especially in less controlled patients. FGM was associated with an increase of patients’ satisfaction regarding treatment. Hypoglycaemic events, however, were not reduced in frequency. Therefore, the need for an educational team and a structure program in the management of this new technology remains mandatory."

Administration of corticosteroids is common in obstetric practice. In this concise review we queried on the effects of corticosteroids in pregnancies complicated by SARS-CoV-2.
Methods
We performed a literature search on PubMed, regarding the use of corticosteroids in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, in pregnancies complicated by SARS-CoV-2, as well as their impact on glycemia in pregnant women with or without diabetes. Furthermore, we searched for effects of SARS-CoV-2 and of other coronaviridae on insulin secretion and glycemia.
Results
SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be a risk factor for complications in pregnancy. Corticosteroids may not be recommended for treating SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia but they may be needed for at-risk pregnancies. Corticosteroids in pregnancy have a diabetogenic potential. SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviridae may have effects on glycemia.
Conclusions
Caution should be exercised while using corticosteroids in pregnant women with COVID-19 requiring preterm delivery."

abstract = "Background
Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is a complaint with often unidentified reasons. Some medicines, including statins therapy, are anticipated to be amongst the reasons for PN.
Aims
This study intended to assess the association of peripheral neuropathy with statins therapy amongst Type 2 diabetic patients.
Methods
At Penang General Hospital, 757 cases were categorized into two groups (564 with statins therapy and 193 without statins therapy). The diagnosis of PN was investigated retrospectively for a period of 10 years (2006–2016). Confounding risk factors as age, diabetes period, hypertension, glycemic control, other co-morbidity, and prescriptions were matched.
Results
About 129 (22.9%) cases from 564 statins users had PN. Only 30 (15.5%) subjects had PN from 193 statins non-users. Chi-square test showed a significant variance among statins treatment cohort and statin-free cohort in the occurrence of PN (P-value: 0.001). Spearman’s investigation presented a positive correlation (r: 0.078, p-value: 0.031) among statins use and PN prevalence. Binary logistic regression was statistically significant for statins therapy as a predictor of peripheral neuropathy incidence (r2: 0.006, p-value: 0.027) amid diabetic patients. The relative risk of peripheral neuropathy connected with statins therapy is (RR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.02–2.11). The excess relative risk is 47.1%. While the absolute risk (AR) is 7.3% and the number needed to harm (NNH) is 14.
Conclusions
The study indicated a positive association between peripheral neuropathy and statins utilization. Peripheral neuropathy was higher amongst statins users than the statins-free group."

abstract = "It has been reported that frequent occurrence of COVID-19 infection in these patients is associated with low cytosolic pH. During virus infection, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level excessively rises. LDH is a cytosolic enzyme and the serum level increases as the cell break down. When anaerobic conditions develop, lactate formation increases from pyruvate. Cell pH is regulated by very complex mechanisms. When lactate increases in the extracellular area, this symporter carries lactate and H+ ion into the cell, and the intracellular pH quickly becomes acidic. Paradoxically, Na+/H+ exchanger activation takes place. While H+ ion is thrown out of the cell, Na+ and Ca+2 enter the cell. When Na+ and Ca+2 increase in the cell, the cells swell and die. Dapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor. Dapagliflozin has been reported to reduce lactate levels by various mechanisms. Also, it reduces oxygen consumption in tissues and causes the use of glucose in the aerobic pathway, thereby reducing lactate production. A lactate decrease in the environment reduces the activation of lactate/H+ symporter. Thus, the H ion pumping into the cell by this symporter is reduced and the cytosolic pH is maintained. Dapagliflozin also directly inhibits NHE. Thus, Na+ and Ca+2 flow to the cell are inhibited. Dapagliflozin provides the continuation of the structure and functions of the cells. Dapagliflozin can prevent the severe course of COVID-19 infection by preventing the lowering of cytosolic pH and reducing the viral load."

We systematically searched the PubMed database up till April 2, 2020 and retrieved all the articles published on SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV that dealt with viral dynamics.
Results
Ample data is available to suggest the differences in etiology, transmission cycle, diagnosis, genetics, hosts, reproductive rates, clinical features, laboratory diagnosis and radiological features between SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
Conclusion
Although SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is more infectious than SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, most infections are generally mild and self-limiting. However, case-fatality rates are very high in patients with COVID-19 with comorbidities, compared to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV."

Results
Calcium supplement exerts a small protective effect against bone loss which disappears after cessation. Antifracture effect of supplemental calcium is limited to older frail women or community-dwelling residents who are vitamin D deficient and have inadequate dietary calcium intake. The results of studies on the association between calcium supplementation and cardiovascular complications are contradictory and do not lead to a decisive conclusion

Many patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have underlying cardiovascular (CV) disease or develop acute cardiac injury during the course of the illness. Adequate understanding of the interplay between COVID-19 and CV disease is required for optimum management of these patients.
Methods
A literature search was done using PubMed and Google search engines to prepare a narrative review on this topic.
Results
Respiratory illness is the dominant clinical manifestation of COVID-19; CV involvement occurs much less commonly. Acute cardiac injury, defined as significant elevation of cardiac troponins, is the most commonly reported cardiac abnormality in COVID-19. It occurs in approximately 8–12% of all patients. Direct myocardial injury due to viral involvement of cardiomyocytes and the effect of systemic inflammation appear to be the most common mechanisms responsible for cardiac injury. The information about other CV manifestations in COVID-19 is very limited at present. Nonetheless, it has been consistently shown that the presence of pre-existing CV disease and/or development of acute cardiac injury are associated with significantly worse outcome in these patients.
Conclusions
Most of the current reports on COVID-19 have only briefly described CV manifestations in these patients. Given the enormous burden posed by this illness and the significant adverse prognostic impact of cardiac involvement, further research is required to understand the incidence, mechanisms, clinical presentation and outcomes of various CV manifestations in COVID-19 patients."

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has a significant association with airflow obstruction and physical inactivity, which are the relevant extra-pulmonary markers of chronic obstructive respiratory disease (COPD). This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of MetS and its correlation with comorbidities and health related quality of life (HRQoL) in South Indian patients with COPD.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted among the 76 COPD patients. Pulmonary function test (PFT) and parameters for MetS such as waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, triglycerides (TGs) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels of COPD patients were measured. HRQoL was calculated using Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).
Results
54% of COPD patients were presented with MetS especially in stage II and III. TGs and HDL-C were significantly associated with the severity of COPD (p < 0.05), while waist circumference, TGs and HDL-C were significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with PFT. Symptom, activity, impact and total scores of SGRQ was increased statistically (p < 0.05) in COPD patients with MetS than without MetS.
Conclusion
According to our findings, screening the grade II and III COPD patients for the presence of MetS is a reasonable option. The results of this study should be confirmed with a larger sample of population."

Materials and methods
A systematic search was conducted using Cochrane library. A simulation model was created using glycemic data from previous disasters (taken as similar in impact to current lockdown) taking baseline HBA1c and diabetes-related complications data from India-specific database. A multivariate regression analysis was conducted to analyse the relationship between the duration of lockdown and glycaemic targets & diabetes-related complications.
Results
The predictive model was extremely robust (R2 = 0.99) and predicted outcomes for period of lockdown up to 90 days. The predicted increment in HBA1c from baseline at the end of 30 days and 45 days lockdown was projected as 2.26% & 3.68% respectively. Similarly, the annual predicted percentage increase in complication rates at the end of 30-day lockdown was 2.8% for non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 2.9% for proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 1.5% for retinal photocoagulation, 9.3% for microalbuminuria, 14.2% for proteinuria, 2.9% for peripheral neuropathy, 10.5% for lower extremity amputation, 0.9% for myocardial infarction, 0.5% for stroke and 0.5% for infections.
Conclusion
The duration of lockdown is directly proportional to the worsening of glycaemic control and diabetes-related complications. Such increase in diabetes-related complications will put additional load on overburdened healthcare system, and also increase COVID19 infections in patients with such uncontrolled glycemia."

Methods
In this cross-sectional study, 104 participants including 65 normoglycemic control subjects and 39 newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients were recruited. Glycemic and metabolic markers were evaluated from fasting blood samples. The mRNA levels of neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase genes in the PBL were quantified by real-time quantitative PCR.
Results
Compared to control subjects, diabetes patients showed a significant down regulation of both neutrophil elastase (p = 0.039) and myeloperoxidase (p = 0.023) mRNA expressions in the PBL. The neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase mRNA levels showed a negative trend with fasting glucose levels but did not show any significant correlations with HbA1c, insulin level, insulin resistance or sensitivity status.

This suggests a prudent attitude including non-stringent control, despite which repeated hypoglycemia quite often occurs in such patients. When looking for possible sources of hypoglycemia, health professionals too often overlook the identification of skin lipodystrophy (LD) due to an incorrect insulin injection technique. This mini-review focuses on the high frequency (57%) of LD in a cohort of 1004 insulin-treated people with DM on dialysis consecutively referring to our joint medical centers, and on its relationship with hypoglycemia and glycemic control/variability. When taking on such patients, care team members accept to face a complex disease burdened with several risk factors requiring high professional skills, and have to keep in mind also the possible presence of any LD areas eventually interfering with expected results. A timely educational intervention on the correct injection technique can help reduce the high risk of hypoglycemia and large glycemic variability in dialysed people with DM."

A detailed review of the literature is done on the technologies of Industry 4.0 and their applications in the COVID-19 pandemic, using appropriate search words on the databases of PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar and Research Gate.
Results
We found several useful technologies of Industry 4.0 which help for proper control and management of COVID-19 pandemic and these have been discussed in this paper. The available technologies of Industry 4.0 could also help the detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 and other related problems and symptoms.
Conclusions
Industry 4.0 can fulfil the requirements of customised face masks, gloves, and collect information for healthcare systems for proper controlling and treating of COVID-19 patients. We have discussed ten major technologies of Industry 4.0 which help to solve the problems of this virus. It is useful to provide day to day update of an infected patient, area-wise, age-wise and state-wise with proper surveillance systems. We also believe that the proper implementation of these technologies would help to enhance education and communication regarding public health.

abstract = "Aims
This study was designed to evaluate the meeting of ABC goals in patients with type 2 diabetes. The ABC goals were defined as meeting the HbA1c <7%, systolic blood pressure <130 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure <80 mmHg, and LDL-C <100 mg/dL. We also determined the associated factors with meeting the ABC goals, as well as the effectiveness of statin therapy.
Methods
We designed a cross-sectional study of 2008 type 2 diabetes patients attending the diabetes clinics of Valiasr Hospital of Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex. Meeting ABC goals and their associated factors were analyzed from the registered data.
Results
At the end of the year 2014, 61.3% of patients met the HbA1c goal, which increased to 77.8% in 2017. Blood pressure of 79.5% of patients met the ADA recommendations by the end of the year 2014, reaching 86.6% in 2017. Moreover, 84.5% and 93.8% could reach the LDL-C goal in 2014 and 2017, respectively. The proportion for the patients meeting all three ABC goals were 23.2% and 42.1% in 2014 and 2017, respectively.
Conclusions
The level of achievement of ABC goals in Iran is lower than expected and it requires a lot of programming effort and follow-up. As patients are followed over the years, controlling ABC becomes much more favorable."

To assess the age and its association with glycemic control (GC) among adults with type 2-diabetes in the United States.
Materials and materials
Data were collected from the National Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013–2014 (n = 697), cross-sectional national survey adults with Type2 diabetes. Characteristics included retinopathy diagnosis, blood pressure, albumin-creatinine ratio, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), BMI, cholesterol, smoking status, pills/insulin, exercise, age, age at diagnosis, education, sex, race, and marital status. Diabetes preventive behaviors were included. Predictors of GC were assessed using logistic regression.
Results
The mean age was 61 (SD ±13); the average age at diagnosis 50 (SD ±12.9) and women (51%). Age ≥60, diabetes length >10yrs, taking pills/on insulin, albumin-creatinine ratio ≤30mg/g, optimal BP, no retinopathy diagnosis, optimal cholesterol, seeing a doctor for diabetes, doctors checkup ≥2 times and checking HbA1c annually were significant predictors of GC. The association between GC and age (OR=.97, p<.001; CI: .96-.98) diabetes length >10yrs (OR=1.55, p<.05; CI: 1.02-2.34), creatinine-albumin ratio ≤30mg/g (OR=1.97, p<.001; CI: 1.32-2.94) and checking HbA1c annually (OR=1.86, p<.01; CI: 1.16-3.00) remained significant after adjustment for the effects of all other statistically significant covariates.
Conclusions
GC was prevalent among older individuals; suggestive of intervention programs for young adults with diabetes and continuous HbA1c assessment at least annually."

Although diabetes mellitus (DM) is no longer considered “coronary heart disease risk equivalent”, the risk remains sufficiently high, necessitating early recognition and management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in these patients. Despite this understanding, the optimum strategy for prediction and early detection of CVD in DM remains debatable.
Methods
Major societal guidelines for prediction and evaluation of CVD in subjects with or without DM were reviewed. Available evidence about various risk stratification strategies-their advantages, disadvantages and current role in clinical practice-were extensively reviewed. Special emphasis was placed on evidence from South Asian/Indian populations.
Results
The inconsistency and variability inherent to the clinical risk algorithms, lack of consensus regarding the incremental value of subclinical atherosclerosis imaging and the lack of sufficient data to demonstrate the benefits of recognizing asymptomatic atherosclerotic disease are some of the reasons underlying prevailing uncertainty about the optimum approach for cardiovascular risk assessment in DM. These challenges notwithstanding, an evidence-based cardiovascular risk stratification strategy incorporating clinical risk algorithms, biomarkers, atherosclerosis imaging, and cardiac stress testing is proposed.
Conclusions
The proposed algorithm should help clinicians in optimizing cardiovascular evaluation and management of their patients with DM. However, this remains a dynamic field; further research into different risk assessment tools, esp. focusing on their impact on improving clinical outcomes, should help refine the evaluation strategy in future."

The role of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the treatment of COVID-19 is not fully known. We studied the efficacy of HCQ compared to the control in COVID-19 subjects on - a. viral clearance measured by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and, b. death due to all cause.
Methods
PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane and MedRxiv database were searched using the specific keywords up to April 30, 2020. Studies that met our objectives were assessed for the risk of bias applying various tools as indicated. Three studies each that reported the outcome of viral clearance by RT-PCR and death due to all cause, were meta-analyzed by applying inverse variance-weighted averages of logarithmic risk ratio (RR) using a random effects model. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed using the I2 statistic and funnel plots, respectively.
Results
Meta-analysis of 3 studies (n = 210) on viral clearance assessed by RT-PCR showed no benefit (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.38; p = 0.74), although with a moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 61.7%, p = 0.07). While meta-analysis of 3 studies (n = 474) showed a significant increase in death with HCQ, compared to the control (RR, 2.17; 95% 1.32 to 3.57; p = 0.002), without any heterogeneity (I2 = 0.0%, p = 0.43).

Health related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important public health issue that mainly associated with a number of certain factors in medical sciences. This study, in particular, aimed to identify HRQoL latent subgroups among patients with type 2 diabetes and assess the role that household food insecurity (HFI) plays in classifying participants to each latent class.
Methods
At the present cross sectional study, all the diabetic patients of the rural regions of Neyshabur (a city in north-east of Iran) were recruited between April and July 2012 (N = 1847). Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was used to determine the latent subgroups of HRQoL. Finally, LCA was used to determine the effect of HFI on dedicating participants to each latent class after adjusting other covariates.
Results
Based on the subscales of HRQoL, three latent classes were identified, including: 1) poor HRQoL (34.6%), 2) moderate HRQoL (39.1%) and 3) good HRQoL (26.3%). After considering the possible confounders, having HFI decrease the odds of membership in latent class 2 (moderate HRQoL) (OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.29–0.60). Also having HFI show similar effect on latent class 3 (good HRQoL) and decrease the odds of membership in this class (OR = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.08–0.20) in compared to the first class (poor HRQoL).
Conclusions
Results from the present study show that HFI plays an important role in decreasing the odds of membership in moderate and good HRQoL classes compared to poor HRQoL."

Diabetes mellitus affects approximately 8.5% of the world’s population with the majority of cases diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Impaired awareness or denial of T2DM is a common yet understudied construct that may negatively contribute to clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to develop the Diabetes Awareness and Insight Scale (DAS), a self-report scale that measures illness awareness in persons with T2DM.
Methods
Nine items were developed for the DAS that measure four domains of illness awareness, namely General Illness Awareness, Accurate Symptom Attribution, Awareness of Need for Treatment, and Awareness of Negative Consequences attributable to T2DM (www.illnessawarenessscales.com). A total of 100 participants with a diagnosis of T2DM were recruited using a digital data collection platform.
Results
The DAS demonstrated good convergent and discriminant validity, internal consistency, and one-month test-retest reliability. An exploratory factor analysis showed that the DAS exhibited three factors.
Conclusions
Overall, the DAS is a novel and easy-to-administer scale that comprehensively measures subjective illness awareness in persons with T2DM. As the first scale of its kind, the DAS holds promise for use in epidemiology studies to examine the extent to which impaired illness awareness or illness denial contributes to clinical outcomes and T2DM management."

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic multi-systemic metabolic disorder; diabetic patients are more prone to xerostomia and oral health problems than others. There are evidences that nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in healthy salivary gland function, prevention of insulin resistance and progression of diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to compare the salivary NO level between type 2 diabetic (T2DM) patients with and without xerostomia.
Methods
In this case control study, 70 patients with T2DM, which were matched according to age, sex, type of disease control, were enrolled conveniently. The subjects based on abeslang test were allocated to the two groups; 35 patients with xerostomia and 35 patients without xerostomia. Unstimulated whole saliva was collected by spitting method. NO levels was measured by ELISA method using Griess reaction. Data was analyzed using t-test, ANOVA and logistic regression analysis to examine the association of salivary NO and xerostomia.
Results
The mean and standard deviation of salivary NO in the diabetic subjects with xerostomia was significantly lower than diabetic subjects without xerostomia (138 ± 94.58 μmol/L vs. 356.61 ± 302.81 μmol/L (P-value = 0.001). In logistic regression analysis, salivary NO level was associated with 0.994 fold decreased risk of xerostomia in diabetic subjects after adjustment for age, gender, FBS and HbA1c.

In a cross-sectional study of 256 patients with metabolic syndrome (157 men, 99 women), the cardiovascular disease risk was evaluated using the FRS scoring system by a pre-defined computerized algorithm. Psychological distress was also assessed by general health questionnaire (GHQ)-12. Evaluation of the biochemical parameters including fasting serum glucose (FSG), lipid profile, liver enzymes and adiponectin concentrations were also performed using the enzymatic methods.
Results
The prevalence of low, intermediate and high risk of CVD in men was significantly higher than women (P < 0.05). Both genders in high risk of CVD had significantly higher age, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and FSG concentrations compared with male and females in intermediate and low risk of CVD (P < 0.05). In multiple logistic regression, being single was in the highest relationship with high psychological distress values compared with married or divorced/separated marital status. Moreover, high SBP and low high density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations were also potent determinants of high psychological distress (P < 0.05).
Conclusions
In the current study, the prevalence of CVD risk factors were higher in men compared with women. Moreover, higher age, SBP and FSG were potent determinants of FRS in both genders. Marital status and serum HDL were in relation with psychological distress among patients with metabolic syndrome."

abstract = "Background
New evidence indicates that overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines is responsible for the development of diabetes difficulties. Some herbals such as saffron, may control inflammation and improve the hyperglycemic states in diabetic patients. Therefore, this investigation aimed to assess the effects of saffron supplementation on fasting glucose and inflammatory markers levels in patients with type2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Methods
In this randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 60 T2DM patients were randomly assigned into two groups as saffron and placebo (n = 30) receiving 100 mg/day saffron powder or starch capsules (1 capsule) for a duration of 8 weeks. Fasting blood sample was collected at baseline and at the end of the intervention. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) was immediately analyzed by the auto-analyzer. The serum level of Interleukin −6 (IL-6), Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and Interleukin-10 (IL-10) were measured using ELISA assay by laboratory kits. Also, Real-time quantitative reverse transcription (RT-PCR) assay measured the expression level of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 at the mRNA level.
Results
Saffron supplementation significantly decreased the FBG levels within 8 weeks compared to placebo (130.93 ± 21.21 vs 135.13 ± 23.03 mg/dl, P = 0.012). Moreover, the serum level of TNF-α notably reduced in the saffron group compared to the placebo group (114.40 ± 24.28 vs 140.90 ± 25.49 pg/ml, P < 0.001). Also, saffron supplementation significantly down-regulated the expressions of TNF-α (P = 0.035) and IL-6 mRNA levels (P = 0.014).
Conclusion
In our study, it was indicated that saffron modulates glucose levels as well as inflammation status in T2DM patients through decreasing the expressions levels of some inflammatory mediators. Also, further investigations are necessary to confirm the positive effects of saffron as a complementary therapy for T2DM patients."

Necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) of the upper extremities is a rare, but potentially life-threatening infection in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We analyzed the clinical characteristics and the outcome of NSTI of upper extremities in these patients.
Methods
This was a retrospective study analyzing the clinical characteristics and the outcomes of 33 T2DM patients with NSTI of upper extremities, who were treated in the department of hand surgery between January 2011 and December 2017.
Results
Predisposing factors for NSTI were recognized in 16 (48.5%) patients. Eleven (33.3)% patients had septic shock while ten (30.3%) had acute renal insufficiency at the time of presentation, of which six required dialysis. The mean glycosylated hemoglobin was 9.6(±2.6)% and the random plasma glucose at admission was 271(±96) mg/dl. Monomicrobial infection was seen in 16(49%) patients and polymicrobial infection in 9(27%) patients. Gram-positive causation was found in 25(66%) patients. Twelve (36.4%) patients required amputation, six (18.2%) of which were major. Death occurred in more than one-fifth (21.2%) of the patients during treatment.
Conclusion
Necrotizing soft tissue infection of the upper extremities in T2DM is associated with increased risk of severe infection, amputation and mortality."

Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is chronic conditions with devastating multi-systemic complication and may be associated with severe form of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to investigate the association between DM and poor outcome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.
Methods
Systematic literature search was performed from several electronic databases on subjects that assess DM and outcome in COVID-19 pneumonia. The outcome of interest was composite poor outcome, including mortality, severe COVID-19, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), need for intensive care unit (ICU) care, and disease progression.
Results
There were a total of 6452 patients from 30 studies. Meta-analysis showed that DM was associated with composite poor outcome (RR 2.38 [1.88, 3.03], p < 0.001; I2: 62%) and its subgroup which comprised of mortality (RR 2.12 [1.44, 3.11], p < 0.001; I2: 72%), severe COVID-19 (RR 2.45 [1.79, 3.35], p < 0.001; I2: 45%), ARDS (RR 4.64 [1.86, 11.58], p = 0.001; I2: 9%), and disease progression (RR 3.31 [1.08, 10.14], p = 0.04; I2: 0%). Meta-regression showed that the association with composite poor outcome was influenced by age (p = 0.003) and hypertension (p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that the association was weaker in studies with median age ≥55 years-old (RR 1.92) compared to <55 years-old (RR 3.48), and in prevalence of hypertension ≥25% (RR 1.93) compared to <25% (RR 3.06). Subgroup analysis on median age <55 years-old and prevalence of hypertension <25% showed strong association (RR 3.33)

We tried to find the current role, availability and need of ventilators in the COVID-19 pandemic and the role of applied innovative technologies is assessed.
Methods
We have done a comprehensive review of the literature using suitable keywords on the search engines of PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar and Research Gate in the second week of April 2020.
Results
We found in our review that there is an acute shortage of the ventilators and the manpower to operate these sophisticated machines. There is significant deficiency in the production and supply chain of the ventilators. Many of the seriously ill patients who require hospitalization may need ventilator support. Non-invasive ventilation is not recommended in these patients.
Conclusion
As the respiratory illness due to COVID-19 pandemic spreads worldwide, health care systems are facing the tough challenges of acquiring ventilators to support patients. All steps involved in the supply chain management of ventilators are being escalated to produce more ventilators for the coronavirus frontline. Innovative applications of Additive medicine like 3-D printer technology may play key role in delivering sufficient ventilators."

Remdesivir is a broad spectrum anti-viral drug that has shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, in vitro and in vivo. In absence of any effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), remdesivir has been tried for a compassionate use in severe COVID-19. Newer randomized controlled studies that have recently become available, showed a mixed result. We aimed to systematically search the literature to understand the pharmacology and clinical effects of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19.
Methods
We systematically searched the PubMed, ClinicalTrial.Org and MedRxiv database up till May 5, 2020 using specific key words such as “Remdesivir” or ‘GS-5734″ AND “COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2” and retrieved all the article published in English language, that have reported the pharmacology and the clinical outcomes of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19.
Results
Initial compassionate use of remdesivir has shown a fairly good result, but difficult to quantify, in the absence of control arm. While the very first double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial conducted in Wuhan, did not find any significant benefit compared to the control, the preliminary result of another similar multi-country trial has shown a significant faster time to recovery but without any difference in mortality.
Conclusions
Remdesivir has shown a mixed result in patients with COVID-19 with an acceptable side effect. However, jury is still out while awaiting the results from the forthcoming trials."

Transcription factor 7 like 2 (TCF7L-2) polymorphism has been associated with adipocyte metabolism and insulin resistance. Genetic investigations of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and atherosclerosis are unknown. This study was designed to investigate the association of rs7903146 (C/T) polymorphism of TCF7L-2 gene with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in Asian Indians.
Methods
In this case-control study 162 non-diabetic subjects with NAFLD and 173 body mass index (BMI)-matched controls without NAFLD were recruited. Abdominal ultrasound, clinical and biochemical investigations, fasting insulin levels and value of homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was measured. Single nucleotide polymorphism rs7903146 (C/T) was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphisms.
Results
The distribution of rs7903146 (C/T) alleles, the dominant model (CT + TT) and higher frequency (31%) of C/T genotype were significantly associated with NAFLD. C/T genotype of TCF7L2 gene was associated with significantly higher levels of BMI (p = 0.02), abdominal obesity (p < 0.05), fasting blood glucose (p = 0.05), hepatic transaminases (p < 0.05) and markers of insulin resistance (p < 0.05) in subjects with NAFLD. Using a multivariate analysis after adjusting for age and sex, TCF7L2 polymorphism was independently associated with presence of NAFLD [(OR: 3.234 (95% CI: 1.219-4.160, p = 0.002)].
Conclusion
TCF7L2 (C/T) gene was Independently associated with NAFLD in Asian Indians."

COVID-19 is already a pandemic. Emerging data suggest an increased association and a heightened mortality in patients of COVID-19 with comorbidities. We aimed to evaluate the outcome in hypertensive patients with COVID-19 and its relation to the use of renin-angiotensin system blockers (RASB).
Methods
We have systematically searched the medical database up to March 27, 2020 and retrieved all the published articles in English language related to our topic using MeSH key words.
Results
From the pooled data of all ten available Chinese studies (n = 2209) that have reported the characteristics of comorbidities in patients with COVID-19, hypertension was present in nearly 21%, followed by diabetes in nearly 11%, and established cardiovascular disease (CVD) in approximately 7% of patients. Although the emerging data hints to an increase in mortality in COVID-19 patients with known hypertension, diabetes and CVD, it should be noted that it was not adjusted for multiple confounding factors. Harm or benefit in COVID-19 patients receiving RASB has not been typically assessed in these studies yet, although mechanistically and plausibly both, benefit and harm is possible with these agents, given that COVID-19 expresses to tissues through the receptor of angiotensin converting enzyme-2.
Conclusion
Special attention is definitely required in patients with COVID-19 with associated comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes and established CVD. Although the role of RASB has a mechanistic equipoise, patients with COVID-19 should not stop these drugs at this point of time, as recommended by various world organizations and without the advice of health care provider."

Outcomes after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery have improved due to advances in surgical technique and post-operative care. We aimed to describe contemporary clinical characteristics and short-term post-operative outcomes in diabetic patients undergoing CABG surgery.
Methods
A retrospective analysis of patients who underwent CABG surgery over a 4.5-year period in a Western Australian tertiary hospital was performed in September 2019. The cohort was stratified according to pre-operative diabetes status.
Results
A total of 1327 patients underwent CABG surgery, of which 572 (43.1%) had diabetes.

abstract = "Background
Many studies on COVID-19 have reported diabetes to be associated with severe disease and mortality, however, the data is conflicting. The objectives of this meta-analysis were to explore the relationship between diabetes and COVID-19 mortality and severity, and to determine the prevalence of diabetes in patients with COVID-19.
Methods
We searched the PubMed for case-control studies in English, published between Jan 1 and Apr 22, 2020, that had data on diabetes in patients with COVID-19. The frequency of diabetes was compared between patients with and without the composite endpoint of mortality or severity. Random effects model was used with odds ratio as the effect size. We also determined the pooled prevalence of diabetes in patients with COVID-19. Heterogeneity and publication bias were taken care by meta-regression, sub-group analyses, and trim and fill methods.
Results
We included 33 studies (16,003 patients) and found diabetes to be significantly associated with mortality of COVID-19 with a pooled odds ratio of 1.90 (95% CI: 1.37–2.64; p < 0.01). Diabetes was also associated with severe COVID-19 with a pooled odds ratio of 2.75 (95% CI: 2.09–3.62; p < 0.01). The combined corrected pooled odds ratio of mortality or severity was 2.16 (95% CI: 1.74–2.68; p < 0.01). The pooled prevalence of diabetes in patients with COVID-19 was 9.8% (95% CI: 8.7%–10.9%) (after adjusting for heterogeneity).
Conclusions
Diabetes in patients with COVID-19 is associated with a two-fold increase in mortality as well as severity of COVID-19, as compared to non-diabetics. Further studies on the pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic implications need to be done."

There were 274 admissions due to DFI, 151 in 2010/11 and 123 in 2016/17. There was an increase in admissions due to neuroischemic DFI (51.0% in 2010/11 to 61.8% in 2016/17, p = 0.048). Staphylococcus aureus (SA) was the most common isolate in 2010/11 (26.7%). In 2016/17 most cultures were mixed polymicrobial and isolation of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased from 2010/11 to 2016/17 (15.9% to 30.6%, p = 0.001, and 9.1% to 13.7%, p = 0.048, respectively).
Conclusion
There was an increase in the prevalence of neuroischemic DFU. The Enterobacteriaceae family replaced SA as the most prevalent pathogen in DFI, with an increase in the isolation of gram-negative microorganisms and mixed polymicrobial cultures. Chronic neuroischemic infected ulcers usually present distinct bacterial isolates; knowledge about the most common agents is warranted in order to better select empiric antibiotic therapy."

In view of restrictions on mobility of patients because of COVID-19 pandemic, face-to-face consultations are difficult. We sought to study the feasibility of telemedicine in this scenario.
Methods
PubMed and Google Scholar search engines were searched using the key terms ‘telemedicine’, ‘diabetes’, ‘COVID-19 up to 31st March 2020. In addition, existing guidelines including those by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), Government of India, were accessed.
Results
We discuss evidence and general guidelines regarding role of telemedicine in patients with diabetes along with its utility and limitations.
Conclusions
Telemedicine is a useful tool for managing patients of diabetes during this lockdown period. However, there is limited data and further research is required."

abstract = "Background and aim
As a result of its rapid spread in various countries around the world, on March 11, 2020, WHO issued an announcement of the change in coronavirus disease 2019 status from epidemic to pandemic disease. The virus that causes this disease is indicated originating from animals traded in a live animal market in Wuhan, China. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 can attack lung cells because there are many conserved receptor entries, namely Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2. The presence of this virus in host cells will initiate various protective responses leading to pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. This review aimed to provide an overview related to this virus and examine the body’s responses and possible therapies.
Method
We searched PubMed databases for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2, Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus. Full texts were retrieved, analyzed and developed into an easy-to-understand review.
Results
We provide a complete review related to structure, origin, and how the body responds to this virus infection and explain the possibility of an immune system over-reaction or cytokine storm. We also include an explanation of how this virus creates modes of avoidance to evade immune system attacks. We further explain the therapeutic approaches that can be taken in the treatment and prevention of this viral infection.
Conclusion
In summary, based on the structural and immune-evasion system of coronavirus, we suggest several approaches to treat the disease."
